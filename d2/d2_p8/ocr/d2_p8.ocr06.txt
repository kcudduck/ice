Fig. 6. TDFD model results for an icequake in a floating ice shelf over a 100 m sub-shelf water cavity. The time series of the source in particle
velocity, analogous to acoustic pressure, has a Gaussian spectrum with a peak frequency of T0Hz. (a, b) TDFD model snapshots of the
(a) compressional and (b) shear wave field at 1.725 s for an icequake at zero range and 150 m depth. Considerable energy interacts with the
sea-floor. For long-range propagation, compressional and converted shear wave reflections and refractions from the sea-floor affect the
vibration of the ice shelf. (c) The structure of the model. The dark blue bar in the upper left corner is the ice sheet, extending out to 4 km (with
Vp=3800ms~', Vs=2194ms" and density of 917 kgm™). The water layer (light blue) has a typical sound speed gradient, with a free
surface (air: thin white bar in top right-hand corner). The ice thickness is 300 m and the water thickness below the ice is 100 m. The sea-floor
consists of 100 m of soft sediment (brown), 2 km of basalt with a typical crustal gradient (red) and 4 km of gabbro with a typical crustal
gradient (not shown). (d) Transfer functions for two ice models similar to the model in (a—c), one with a 300 m thick ice shelf and one with a
150m ice shelf. The transfer functions are computed from time series at the surface of the model and are normalized for the source
spectrum. Prominent resonances are observed near 6 and 11 Hz. These preliminary results suggest that the resonance band at 10 Hz (Fig. 5)
could be an elastic wave resonance in the ice-water-sea-floor system that is excited by icequakes forced by ocean gravity-wave impacts.
