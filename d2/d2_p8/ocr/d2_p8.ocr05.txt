even after swell forcing is mostly damped by sea ice during April. Other resonance bands are visible near 1.0 and 1.75 Hz. Note the
broadband transient responses associated with local-to-regional high-amplitude swell arrivals that extend to frequencies well above the
typical upper bound of the gravity-wave forcing band (about 0.3 Hz; Bromirski and others, 1999), similar to those identified by Martin and
others (2010) as fragmentation fracture signals, suggesting that these signals may result from icequakes forced by gravity-wave impacts.
(b, d) Percentile spectra during the February and April time periods shown in (a). Percentile levels give an indication of the seasonal
persistence of respective resonance bands. There is about a 30dB drop from February to April levels in both the swell (red arrows) and
apparently swell-enhanced 0.5 Hz (black arrows) resonance bands. In contrast, the levels in the IG waveband remain largely unchanged,
indicating that IG waves are not appreciably damped by sea ice. Note the appearance in (d) of the 10 Hz peak during April (blue arrow).
(c) Coherence between the vertical and N=S seismometer components at RIS2. Note the significant change in coherence when sea-ice
damping advances during April, with enhancement of coherence near 10 Hz that is consistent with the appearance of the 10 Hz peak in (d).
