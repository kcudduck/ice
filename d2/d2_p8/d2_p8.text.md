                        ABSTRACT. Comparison of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS, Antarctica) response at near-front seismic station
                        RIS2 with seismometer data collected on tabular iceberg B15A and with land-based seismic stations at
                        Scott Base on Ross Island (SBA) and near Lake Vanda in the Dry Valleys (VNDA) allows identification of
                        RIS-specific signals resulting from gravity-wave forcing that includes meteorologically driven wind
                        waves and swell, infragravity (IG) waves and tsunami waves. The vibration response of the RIS varies
                        with season and with the frequency and amplitude of the gravity-wave forcing. The response of the RIS
                        to IG wave and swell impacts is much greater than that observed at SBA and VNDA. A spectral peak at
                        near-ice-front seismic station RIS2 centered near 0.5 Hz, which persists during April when swell is
                        damped by sea ice, may be a dominant resonance or eigenfrequency of the RIS. High-amplitude swell
                        events excite relatively broadband signals that are likely fracture events (icequakes). Changes in
                        coherence between the vertical and horizontal sensors in the 8–12 Hz band from February to April,
                        combined with the appearance of a spectral peak near 10 Hz in April when sea ice damps swell, suggest
                        that lower (higher) temperatures during austral winter (summer) months affect signal propagation
                        characteristics and hence mechanical properties of the RIS.
