Published online 10 OCT 2016              Recently, observations were reported of rather unusual atmospheric wave activity in Antarctica [Chen et al.,
                                          2016]. With a lidar instrument operating at McMurdo, Antarctica, Chen et al. [2016] observed persistent,
                                          large-amplitude acoustic-gravity waves with 3–10 h periods and vertical wavelengths between 20 and
                                          30 km from the stratosphere to lower thermosphere. Remarkably, these waves were present during every
                                          lidar observation throughout the 5 year observation period at McMurdo, and no similar atmospheric wave
                                          activity was ever observed at midlatitude and low-latitude locations [Chen et al., 2016].
                                          From tropospheric to mesospheric heights, dominant nontidal atmospheric waves are believed to be gener-
                                          ated by moist convection, shear ﬂow instabilities, jets, atmospheric fronts, and interaction of winds with the
                                          Earth’s topography [Gossard and Hooke, 1975; Fritts and Alexander, 2003; Geller et al., 2013; Vincent et al., 2013;
                                          Plougonven and Zhang, 2014; Alexander et al., 2016]. At high latitudes, auroral activity also makes a signiﬁcant
                                          contribution [Hunsucker, 1982; Oyama and Watkins, 2012]. These wave sources are intermittent and are not
                                          known to generate persistent wave activity or a narrow range of vertical wavelengths.
                                          In this paper, we propose a possible explanation for the cause of the observed persistent atmospheric wave
                                          activity at McMurdo, Antarctica. The observations were made in the immediate vicinity of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS)
                                          (Figure 1). The RIS occupies the southern part of the Ross Sea and is the world’s largest ice shelf. Presence of ice
                                          sheets introduces additional vibration modes [Press and Ewing, 1951; Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978, 1981;
                                          Sergienko, 2013; MacAyeal et al., 2015], which can potentially enhance conversion of oceanic wave energy into
                                          atmospheric waves. Exceptionally large horizontal dimensions of the RIS facilitate radiation by the ice shelf
                                          oscillations of long atmospheric waves that can reach thermospheric altitudes. Previous studies revealed
                                          waves in the middle and upper atmosphere that were generated by various wave processes in the ocean
                                          and solid earth such as tsunamis [Artru et al., 2005; Makela et al., 2011; Galvan et al., 2012; Komjathy et al.,
                                          2012; Occhipinti et al., 2013], earthquakes [Lognonné, 2010; Maruyama et al., 2012; Astafyeva et al., 2013;
                                          Occhipinti et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2014], volcanic eruptions [Tahira, 1995; Watada and
                                          Kanamori, 2010], and background infragravity waves in the ocean [Godin et al., 2015; Zabotin et al., 2016].

                                          Vibrations of ﬂoating glaciers are primarily studied in connection with iceberg calving and ice shelf stability
                                          [Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978, 1981; MacAyeal et al., 2006; Sergienko, 2013; Papathanasiou et al., 2015]. In that
                                          context, resonances with periods of less than about 30 s, which can be efﬁciently excited by sea swell and
                                          lead to the glacier breakup, are of primarily interest. In contrast, the fundamental mode and other low-order
                                          (hence longer period) resonances are most relevant to problem of origin of the persistent atmospheric wave
                                          activity, which has periods of several hours. To make an analytical treatment of the problem possible, we sim-

                                          which is grounded on one (southern) side, faces the ocean on another (northern) side, and is supported by
                                          solid earth on the other (east and west) sides. Seaﬂoor will be modeled as a rigid horizontal plane. We will
                                          be interested in long waves with horizontal wavelengths that are much larger than the ocean depth and
                                          the ice thickness.
                                          Below, a Cartesian coordinate system is used with horizontal coordinates x and y and a vertical coordinate z.
                                          The vertical coordinate z is zero on the seaﬂoor and increases upward. The ice shelf grounding line (the south
                                          edge of the ice shelf) is located at x = 0. The ice front (the north edge of the ice shelf) is located at x = L. The
                                          east and west edges of the ice shelf are at y = ±Ly/2, 0 < x < L.
                                          The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, low-frequency oscillations of the RIS are studied in a traditional
                                          thin-plate, long-wave approximation. To overcome some physically undesirable limitations of this approach,
                                          a layered-ﬂuid approximation is introduced and investigated in section 3. A simple model of generation of
                                          waves in the atmosphere by oscillations of large ice shelves is applied in section 4 to evaluate kinematic para-

                                          ing atmospheric waves are studied in section 5. Section 6 summarizes our ﬁndings.


                                          2. Ice Shelf Vibrations in the Thin-Plate Approximation
                                          Vibrations of ice shelves and ice tongues are usually described mathematically in the thin-beam (assuming
                                          that the waveﬁeld depends on a single Cartesian horizontal coordinate) or thin-plate (where the waveﬁeld
                                          can be a generic function of horizontal coordinates) approximations [Press and Ewing, 1951; Wadhams, 1973;
                                          Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978, 1981; Williams and Robinson, 1981; Squire et al., 1995; Squire, 2007; Sergienko,
                                          2013; Papathanasiou et al., 2015]. In these approximations, vertical motions are averaged, and the problem

                        water and ice is not taken into account [Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978, 1981; Squire et al., 1995; Sergienko, 2013;
                        Papathanasiou et al., 2015]. This is justiﬁed as long as the phase speed of wave solutions to equations (1) and
                        (2) is small compared to the velocity of compressional waves in water (~1500 m/s) and ice (~3500 m/s).

                                                             Dk 6 þ ρ2 g  ρ1 ω2 H1 k 2 ¼ ρ2 ω2 =H2 :                             (4)

                        Equation (4) relates wave number k = (kx2 + ky2)1/2 and circular frequency ω of the plane waves and has the
                        meaning of the dispersion relation of free waves in the coupled ice-ocean system, when there are no nonhor-
                        izontal boundaries. When viewed in 3-D, the plane waves are horizontally propagating surface waves.
                        Equation (4) is cubic with respect to k2, and its analytic solutions are readily available and are given, e.g., by
                        Cardano’s formula [Korn and Korn, 1968]. We are interested in the fundamental mode and low-order modes of
                        the RIS vibrations. In these modes, k ~ L1 and is very small. Below, we obtain long-wave asymptotics, equa-
                        tion (5), of the free-wave dispersion relation directly from equation (4). The same result can be also obtained
                        —but with much more algebra—from Cardano’s formula in the limit ω → 0.
                        For waves with a bounded phase speed c ≡ ω/k, frequency ω → 0 when k → 0. In the long-wave limit, it is suf-
                        ﬁcient to retain only the lowest-order term, ρ2gk2, in the left side of equation (4). Then, we obtain rather sim-
                        ple dispersion relation:
                                                                                pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
                                                                         ω ¼ k gH2 :                                                   (5)

                        This is the only solution to equation (4) that gives a ﬁnite, nonzero phase speed in the limit k → 0. It follows
                        from equations (4) and (5) that neglecting the term ρ1H1ω2 compared to ρ2g and Dk6 compared to ρ2gk2 in
                        equation (4) is justiﬁed as long as L ≫ H1 + H2 and the shear wave speed in the plate (i.e., in ice) is small com-
                        pared to (gL4H13)1/2. These conditions are easily met for the RIS and other large ice shelves.
                        The dispersion relation equation (5) for long free waves in the coupled ice shelf-ocean system coincides with
                        the dispersion relation of long waves in ice-free water of depth H2. Hence, ﬂexural-gravity waves propagate
                        within ice horizontally with the speed of infragravity waves [Webb et al., 1991; Godin et al., 2014; Ardhuin et al.,
                        2014] in an ice-free ocean. In this approximation, neither ﬂexural rigidity nor inertia of the ice shelf has any
                        effect on the wave propagation speed. The free waves are not dispersive; their phase and group speeds have
                        frequency independent value (gH2)1/2 according to equation (5).
                        In an unbounded ﬂoating ice shelf, the wave frequency and wave number vary continuously in equation (5).
                        In the case of a ﬁnite ice shelf, appropriate boundary conditions need to be imposed at the ice grounding line,
                        on the ice front, and at the side boundaries. The boundary conditions select discrete values of wave vector k
                        and, through equation (5), determine resonant frequencies of the ice shelf. We assume that the ocean is lim-
                        ited by rigid vertical walls at the grounding line and the side boundaries. Then

                        Ocean depth H0 in ice-free ocean beyond the ice front is related to H1 and H2 by the condition of hydrostatic
                        equilibrium, which gives H0 = H2 + H1 ρ1/ρ2. Let ﬂuid motion in the ice-free ocean be described by the velocity

                        Although highly idealized, the boundary conditions (6)–(9) are the conditions that are normally employed
                        when considering linear dynamics of ice shelves in the long-wave approximation [Squire et al., 1995;
                        Sergienko, 2010; Papathanasiou et al., 2015]. Equation (8) expresses continuity of pressure in ﬂuid at x = L.

                        and suppressed. Equation (11) describes an infragravity wave [Webb et al., 1991; Godin et al., 2014; Ardhuin
                        et al., 2014] that is propagating in ice-free ocean away from the ice shelf.
                        Substitution of equations (10) and (11) into boundary conditions (8) and (9) on the ice front gives two simul-
                        taneous linear algebraic equations for unknown A1 and A0. Nontrivial solutions of the simultaneous algebraic
                        equations exist when
                                                                     tank 1x L ¼ ik 0x H0 =k 1x H2 :                                             (12)

                        Equation (12) is the dispersion relation of low-order ice shelf resonances in the thin-plate approximation. It is
                        expected that the resonance oscillations of the RIS are excited by tides [Padman et al., 2003; Bromirski et al.,
                        2015], incident ocean waves [Holdsworth and Glynn, 1978, 1981; MacAyeal et al., 2006; Sergienko, 2010;
                        Bromirski et al., 2010; Bromirski and Stephen, 2012; Bromirski et al., 2015; Papathanasiou et al., 2015], and pos-
                        sibly by wind. Speciﬁc mechanisms of the excitation and amplitudes of the RIS oscillations are beyond the
                        scope of this paper.
                        Consider the resonances that do not involve horizontal motion along the ice front; l = 0 for these resonances.
                        Then, the right side of equation (12) is independent of frequency and solutions are readily obtained analytically:

                        Note that ζ < 0. Only complex solutions ωn exist at l = 0. Complexity of the resonance frequency ωn means
                        that after being excited by an external action, resonant oscillations decay in time: |exp(iωnt)| = exp(ζ t).
                        Spatially, the amplitude of the resonance oscillations increases with distance from the grounding line accord-
                        ing to equation (10).
                        For some l ≠ 0, L, and Ly, dispersion equation (12) may admit real-valued solutions for resonance frequencies
                        provided that 2πl(gH2)1/2ω 1 < Ly < 2πl(gH0)1/2ω 1.

                        As expected, k is of the order of L1. T0 has the meaning of the period of resonance oscillations. Periods
                        Tn = 2π/Re ωn are progressively shorter for higher-order resonances according to equation (13). Using
                        L = 550 km and H2 = 400 m to estimate the longest period of the RIS resonant vibrations, from equation
                        (14) we obtain T0 ≈ 9.8 h, which is close to the reported longest period (10–10.6 h) of persistent atmospheric
                        waves observed at McMurdo, Antarctica [Chen et al., 2016]. The periods of the RIS resonance vibrations will be
                        further discussed in section 5, where the effects of Earth’s rotation are taken into account.

                        While it is expected that ﬂexural rigidity of ice has little effect on long waves [Squire et al., 1995; Papathanasiou
                        et al., 2015], the absence in equation (5) of any inertial effect of the ice motion on free wave propagation is

                        has to account for the vertical structure of the wave motion in the coupled ice shelf-ocean system and, speci-

                        Substitution of equations (11) and (25)–(27) into boundary conditions equations (22)–(24) gives a set of three
                        linear algebraic equations for unknown amplitudes A1, A2, and A0. Nontrivial solutions of the algebraic equa-
                        tions exist when
                                                                    k 1x tank 1x L ¼ k 2x tank 2x L:                                  (28)

                        Equation (28) is the dispersion relation of ice shelf resonances in the ﬂuid model. As expected, equation (28)
                        indicates that in addition to ice shelf dimensions, both the ice thickness and water depth as well as the ice-
                        water density ratio affect the frequencies of ice shelf resonances. This is in contrast to the thin-plate model
                        that we considered in section 2.
                        Equation (28) gives real-valued resonance frequencies when k1x and k2x are either simultaneously real or
                        simultaneously imaginary. In particular, one obtains real resonance frequencies ωn, n = 0, 1, 2, …, when
                        l = 0. It follows from equation (21) that c22/c12 ≪ 1 in the ice shelf problem because the ice and water density
                        difference is relatively small. Then, for the fundamental mode we ﬁnd from equation (28)
                                                                                           
                                                                              πc2       c22

                        Terms of the third order in the ratio c2/c1 are neglected in equation (29) compared to unity. Each mode of
                        resonance vibrations contains fast and slow surface waves. The relative weights of the slow and fast waves
                        are determined by the ratio of constants A2 and A1 in equations (25)–(27). It follows from equations (22),
                        (26), and (29) that A2 ≫ A1 in the fundamental mode, i.e., slow waves with k = ω/c2 dominate in ice shelf vibra-
                        tions in this resonance.
                        To estimate the longest period of resonance oscillations of the RIS, we take L = 550 km, H1 = 300 m, and
                        H2 = 400 m (see Figure 1) and obtain T0 = 2π/ω0 ≈ 22.7 h. However, the atmospheric waves that are generated
                        by slow surface waves in the ice shelf are unlikely to propagate to high altitudes due to dissipation in air and
                        the critical level ﬁltering, which are brieﬂy discussed in section 4. Another solution of equation (28) gives a
                        resonance, which is expected to generate atmospheric waves much more efﬁciently because the fast waves
                        are dominant in that case. When c2/c1 ≪ 1 and l = 0, equation (28) has solutions in the vicinity of points, where
                        k1xL = π(n + 1/2). The lowest-order resonance in this series has the frequency
                                                                                     

                        For the set of parameters that we have chosen to represent the RIS, equation (30) gives wave period T ≈ 6.3 h.
                        This solution corresponds to n = 2, l = 0 in Figures 2b and 2d, which show numerical solutions of equation (28).
                        An improved description of the ice shelf interaction with ocean in the underice cavity in the layered ﬂuid
                        model leads to a richer set of long-period resonant oscillations than in the thin-plate model. For representa-
                        tive parameters of the RIS, equation (28) gives nondecaying resonances at l = 0, 1, 2. Comparison of Figures 2a

                        and 2b shows that the difference in periods between the fundamental mode (n = l = 0) and other low-order
                        modes of resonant oscillations is much smaller in the layered ﬂuid model than in the thin-plate model. Note
                        that ωn, 1 and ωn, 2 increase with n slower than ωn, 0 (Figure 2b). At n > 1, vibration modes with a zonal struc-
                        ture (l > 0) can have longer periods than respective modes without dependence of the ice displacement on
                        the coordinate y along the ice front.
                        We postpone comparison of the resonance periods that are predicted in the layered ﬂuid model and the per-
                        iods of persistent atmospheric waves observed at McMurdo, Antarctica [Chen et al., 2016], until section 5,
                        where effects of Earth’s rotation are taken into account.

                        4. Properties of Atmospheric Waves
                        Waves that propagate along the surface of the ocean or ice shelf generate perturbations in the atmosphere.
                        These perturbations are propagating or evanescent atmospheric waves depending on the frequency and
                        phase speed of waves on the surface. Because air density is small compared to the water and ice densities,
                        to ﬁrst order one can neglect the effect of atmospheric loading on long waves in the ocean. Then, one can
                        investigate the nature of induced atmospheric perturbations by using the properties of waves on the surface
                        that were predicted without taking the atmospheric loading into account [Godin et al., 2015].
                        Acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) in the atmosphere have the dispersion relation [Godin, 2014, 2015]
                                                                                            

                        where cs and u are the sound speed and wind velocity, γ ≈ 1.4 is the ratio of speciﬁc heats in air at constant
                        pressure and constant volume, (kx, ky, m) and ω are the AGW wave vector and frequency, k = (kx, ky, 0) is the
                        horizontal wave vector, and ωd = ω  k·u is the intrinsic frequency. Here we disregard the effect of dissipative
                        processes on the AGW dispersion relation. When atmosphere is horizontally stratiﬁed and stationary, i.e., γ, cs,
                        and u are independent of horizontal coordinates and time, ω and k remain constant, while m varies with
                        height. Strictly speaking, AGWs reduce to gravity waves and acoustic waves in the limits where ﬂuid compres-
                        sibility or buoyancy becomes negligible [Gossard and Hooke, 1975]. Often, AGWs with frequencies |ωd| <
                        (γ  1)1/2g/cs and |ωd| > γg/2cs are loosely referred to as gravity waves and infrasound, respectively. (With this
                        loose terminology—which we will not use—the atmospheric waves that are discussed further in this section
                        would be called gravity waves.)
                        Atmospheric perturbations that are generated by surface waves have the same frequency ω and horizontal
                        wave vector k as the surface waves. The sign of m2 in equation (31) determines whether AGWs are propagat-
                        ing (m2 > 0) or evanescent (m2 < 0). Consider ﬁrst AGWs in the absence of wind. From equation (31) we ﬁnd
                                                                                                      

                        where c = ω/k. For the fundamental and low-order ice shelf resonances considered in sections 2 and 3, c is
                        frequency independent and is small compared to the sound speed cs in air. Then, the quantity in brackets
                        in the right side of equation (32) is close to 1. The term with k2 in the right side of equation (32) is small com-
                        pared to the term (γ  1)g2/c2cs2 for all waves with frequencies ω ≪ g/cs, i.e., for waves with periods longer
                        than about 10 min. This condition is easily met by the fundamental and low-order ice shelf resonances con-
                        sidered in sections 2 and 3. Hence, these resonance vibrations of ice shelves generate upward propagating
                        atmospheric waves. Their vertical wavelength

                        perature of air. This is consistent with the observation by Chen et al. [2016] that changes in λz are typically
                        within the factor of 1.5 from the stratosphere to lower thermosphere. As discussed above, typical values of
                        c in different models are between (gH2)1/2 and (gH1 + gH2)1/2 (except for slow surface waves in the layered
                        ﬂuid model), or about 50–90 m/s for the RIS. According to equation (33), it translates into λz values of about
                        20–30 km. This is in very good agreement with the observed values [Chen et al., 2016].

                        According to equation (31), one needs to replace c with |c  uk| in equations (32) and (33) in order to take the
                        wind into account. Here uk is the projection of the wind velocity u on the direction of vector k. The effect of
                        wind on the atmospheric waves generated by ice-shelf vibrations is threefold. First, AGWs are strongly dissi-
                        pated in the vicinity of the critical height where ωd = 0 or, equivalently, c = uk. Therefore, winds ﬁlter out
                        slower waves, which encounter critical heights between the ice surface and the observation altitude.
                        Second, variations of wind velocity with altitude contribute, in addition to temperature variations, to changes
                        in the vertical wavelength of AGWs with height and in time. Third, winds can complicate the anisotropy of the
                        ﬁeld of atmospheric waves. In the absence of winds, the longest-period atmospheric waves, which are gen-
                        erated by the fundamental mode of ice shelf vibrations, are expected to propagate meridionally. Winds
                        change the group speed and propagation direction of AGWs with a given k and, through the critical level ﬁl-
                        tering [Gossard and Hooke, 1975; Fritts and Alexander, 2003] and changes in dissipation rate [Godin, 2014],
                        affect the azimuthal distribution of AGW power ﬂux. Despite these potentially signiﬁcant effects, winds do
                        not change the period of atmospheric waves that are generated by ice shelf vibrations. The range of vertical
                        wavelengths λz is little changed by winds as long as the ranges of variation of c and |c  uk| are similar. For
                        predominantly zonal winds, this is expected to be the case for the fundamental mode of the RIS vibrations
                        and lower-order modes with ky = 0.
                        We supplement these theoretical considerations with calculations for a realistic model of the Antarctic atmo-
                        sphere at the time of observations (Figure 3). Wind velocity proﬁles at McMurdo were generated by the
                        Horizontal Wind Model 2014 (HWM14) model [Drob et al., 2015] for 1 day in June 2014. The wind velocity
                        experiences strong and rapid variations, especially at altitudes above 35 km. To obtain a background wind
                        proﬁle that is suitable to model propagation of waves with periods of 3–10 h, the output of the HWM14
                        model was averaged over 1 day and smoothed by calculating a running average over 15 km range of alti-
                        tudes (Figure 3a). The zonal component of the background wind (not shown) was found to be an order of
                        magnitude stronger than the meridional component at altitudes from the sea level to 110 km. The
                        NRLMSISE-00.2 model [Picone et al., 2002] was utilized to obtain an average proﬁle of temperature for the
                        same day (Figure 3b). The dispersion equation (31) of atmospheric waves was used to calculate the vertical
                        wavelength λz = 2π/m (Figures 3c and 3d). The calculations demonstrated that strong zonal winds block
                        upward propagation of atmospheric waves that were generated by the RIS resonances with l ≠ 0. The reso-
                        nances with l = 0 generate atmospheric waves with ky = 0; these waves are not sensitive to zonal winds.
                        Figures 3c–3e refer to waves with ky = 0.
                        Figure 3c illustrates the altitude dependence of λz when the thin-plate approximation is employed to ﬁnd the
                        RIS resonant vibrations. Meridional component of the wind velocity makes the wavelengths different for
                        waves with opposite signs of the x component, kx, of the wave vector. Within the 30–115 km altitude range
                        of the Chen et al. [2016] observations, the predicted wavelengths for both kx signs are within the range of 17–
                        26 km. This is close to the observed range of 20–30 km [Chen et al., 2016]. In agreement with theoretical con-
                        siderations, λz proves to be insensitive to the mode order n of the RIS resonant vibrations.
                        In the layered ﬂuid approximation, fast and slow waves in ice contribute to generation of atmospheric waves.
                        Atmospheric waves that are generated by slow waves in ice are much shorter than the atmospheric waves
                        generated by the fast waves (Figure 3d) and, as has been already mentioned, are expected to be strongly
                        attenuated by dissipative processes in the atmosphere [Gossard and Hooke, 1975; Fritts and Alexander,
                        2003; Godin, 2014]. Fast waves generate atmospheric waves with 23 km < λz < 33 km (Figure 3d), which is
                        consistent with observations of Chen et al. [2016]. Approximate equation (33) provides a good estimate for
                        the λz range (Figure 3d).
                        The results presented in Figures 3c and 3d are insensitive to n and, hence, to wave period. However, as dis-
                        cussed in the next section, the latter conclusion is valid only for waves with periods less than about 5 h.


                        5. Effects of Earth Rotation
                        So far, we have ignored possible effects of Earth rotation on atmospheric waves and oscillations in the
                        coupled ocean-ice shelf system. This can be justiﬁed only for waves with periods much smaller than the per-
                        iod Te = 24 h of the Earth rotation. In practice, the rotation effects are usually negligible for waves with periods
                        less than a few hours. This condition is certainly not met by the longer-period part of the persistent

                        Earth rotation in the f plane approximation [Gill, 1982], where ﬂuid motion in a noninertial reference frame is
                        described by including in the Euler equation the Coriolis force due to vertical component of the angular velo-

                        When supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions, ﬁrst-order differential equations (36) and (39)
                        allow one to determine unknown vertical dependencies of the wave-induced pressure perturbation p and
                        vertical displacement wz. After these are found, all other characteristics of the waveﬁeld can be calculated
                        in terms of p and wz. When Ω = 0, equations (36) and (39) reduce to known governing equations for AGW
                        in nonrotating ﬂuids, see equations (5) and (6) in Godin [2012]. (Speciﬁcally, equation (36) coincides with
                        equation (5) in Godin [2012], and equation (39) with Ω = 0 gives equation (6) in Godin [2012]). In the particular
                        case of incompressible, quiescent ﬂuid of constant density, equations (36) and (39) reduce to equation (15)
                        that we used in section 3. (In section 3 the notation w was used for the vertical displacement wz.)
                        Note that when written in terms of p and wz, boundary conditions on horizontal ﬂuid-ﬂuid interfaces as well
                        as on rigid and pressure-release surfaces contain neither k nor ω [Godin, 1997, 2012]. Let us consider motion-
                        less layered ﬂuids with piecewise continuous variations of ρ and cs and a uniform background ﬂow. When du/
                        dz = 0, governing equations for waves in rotating and nonrotating ﬂuids differ only by k being replaced with
                                                                                          1=2
                                                                   k ðrÞ ¼ k 1  f 2C =ω2d                                        (40)

                        in equation (39). Hence, dispersion equations of surface waves and other normal modes in horizontally
                        unbounded rotating ﬂuids differ from respective dispersion equations in nonrotating ﬂuids by replacing k
                        with k(r). In particular, equation (21) remains valid for long waves in a two-layered incompressible rotating
                        ﬂuid but with c = ω/k(r) rather than c = ω/k. This is consistent with known results [Gill, 1982] for single-layered
                        incompressible rotating ﬂuids. Equation (40) shows that surface waves, which are nondispersive in the
                        absence of rotation, become dispersive, when fC ≠ 0, and are strongly dispersive, when ωd ~ fC.
                        More generally, in the long-wave limit (i.e., at k → 0) the dispersion equation of surface waves with ﬁnite, non-
                        zero phase speed c has the form k = ω/c in nonrotating ﬂuids. Let the surface wave give a resonance with fre-

                        here we limit our analysis to waves without dependence on the horizontal coordinate y, which is parallel to
                        the ice front. We assume that such waves satisfy boundary conditions on the side boundaries y = ±Ly/2 of the
                        ice shelf. Repeating the derivations that are outlined in section 3, at 0 < x < L we obtain from equations (36)
                        and (39)

                        Boundary conditions on the ice front, equations (22)–(24), give a set of three linear algebraic equations for
                        unknown constants A0, A1, and A2 in equations (42)–(46). The dispersion relation of ice shelf resonances

                                                                          k 1 tank 1 L ¼ k 2 tank 2 L                                   (47)
                        is obtained as the condition of existence of nontrivial solutions of the algebraic equations.
                        Equation (47) is similar to the dispersion relation equation (28) in the no-rotation case except k1 and k2 in the
                        presence of rotation are given by equation (42) instead of equation (25) with l = 0. A comparison of equations
                        (25) and (42) veriﬁes the relation equation (41) between the resonance frequencies of ice shelf vibrations in
                        problems with and without rotation.
                        Now consider the inﬂuence of rotation on atmospheric waves. The terms with the angular velocity Ω in the
                        left side of equation (39) vanish in the limit du/dz → 0 and are small in the case of slow, gradual variation of
                        the wind velocity with altitude. The terms with du/dz are inversely proportional to the spatial scale of the alti-
                        tude dependence of wind velocity. This spatial scale serves as a large parameter in the asymptotic expansions
                        that lead to the ray and Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximations [Godin, 2014, 2015]. Therefore, the
                        terms with du/dz have no effect on the AGW dispersion relation but will affect the Berry phase and wave
                        amplitude in the ray and WKB approximations [see Godin, 2014, 2015]. Hence, AGW dispersion equation in
                        rotating atmosphere is obtained from equation (31) by replacing k with k(r), equation (40):
                                                                                                     

                                                                 cs     4cs  ωd  f c         ω2d c2s

                        This result agrees with a known dispersion equation [Gossard and Hooke, 1975, p. 112] for the particular case
                        of waves in an isothermal, quiescent, rotating atmosphere.
                        We use the AGW dispersion equation (48) to address properties of atmospheric waves that are generated by
                                                                                                             1=2
                        resonance vibrations of ice shelves. Let u = 0, ω > fC, and denote c ¼ k1 ω2  f 2C       . In the case of ice shelf
                        vibrations, c has the meaning of the phase speed of a long surface wave as calculated without account for
                        rotation; c is frequency independent in the long-wave limit and small compared to the sound speed cs in
                        air. From equation (48) we ﬁnd
                                                                                                       

                        Equation (49) is quite similar to equation (32) that has been discussed in section 4 except in the right side of
                        equation (49) we have ω2 c2 ¼ k 2 þ f 2C c2 instead of k2 in equation (32). As before, the term with ω 2 in the
                        right side of equation (49) is small compared to the term (γ  1)g2/c2cs2 for all waves with frequencies ω ≪ g/cs,
                        or with periods longer than about 10 min. For the vertical wavelength of atmospheric waves we again obtain
                        equation (33). Hence, Earth’s rotation does not change any conclusions that are made in section 4 regarding
                        the vertical structure of atmospheric waves as long as the wind speed is sufﬁciently small.
                        In contrast to the vertical structure of atmospheric waves radiated by ice shelf resonance vibrations, Earth’s
                        rotation has a signiﬁcant effect on the frequencies of the atmospheric waves. The frequencies are determined

                        quencies, and the effect is the stronger the lower the resonant frequency. We have ωn ≥ max(ωn, fC), and

                        ωn   ≈ fC when ωn ≪ fC. In polar regions 2π/fC is close to 12 h. Then equation (41) maps the range
                        3 h < Tn < 24 h of the ice-shelf resonant periods Tn = 2π/ωn, which are calculated in the nonrotating case, into

                        the range 2.9 h < T n < 10.7 h of resonant periods T n ¼ 2π=ωn to be observed in polar regions.
                        Figure 2 complements these general considerations with numerical results obtained for a speciﬁc RIS model
                        in the thin-plate (Figure 2c) and layered-ﬂuid (Figure 2d) approximations. In the thin-plate approximation, the
                        RIS is predicted to have two modes of resonant vibrations (n = 0, 1 and l = 0) that radiate atmospheric waves
                        with periods in the 3–10 h range (Figure 2c). In the layered-ﬂuid approximation, at least 15 modes of resonant
                        vibrations (0 ≤ n ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ l ≤ 2) ﬁll this range of periods (Figure 2d). This is consistent with the diversity of
                        atmospheric wave periods observed by Chen et al. [2016]. In the absence of rotation, T0 ≈ 22.7 h for the fun-
                        damental mode, see section 3. Due to effects of Earth’s rotation, the fundamental mode period in Figure 2d
                        decreases and proves to be very close to the upper bound of periods of the persistent atmospheric wave
                        activity observed at McMurdo [see Chen et al., 2016, Figure 6]. This coincidence suggests that the upper
                        bound of the observed periods is primarily determined by the Coriolis parameter rather than details of the
                        resonant oscillations. The vertical wavelength λz = 2π/m, on the other hand, is sensitive to the phase speed
                        c of the waves, which are responsible for resonant vibrations of the ice shelf.
                        Figure 3e illustrates the altitude dependence of the vertical wavelength of atmospheric waves, which is cal-
                        culated from the dispersion equation (48) for the realistic atmospheric model shown in Figures 3a and 3b. The
                        atmospheric waves in Figure 3e are generated by the RIS resonant vibrations, which are modeled in the
                        layered-ﬂuid approximation (Figure 2d). As in the nonrotating case (Figure 3d), upward propagation of waves
                        with ky ≠ 0 is blocked by strong zonal winds, and only resonances with l = 0 are represented in Figure 3e.
                        Calculations conﬁrm that the effect of Earth’s rotation on λz is negligible in the absence of winds. However,
                        the combined effect of the rotation and winds proves to be rather strong. In contrast to the nonrotating case
                        (Figure 3d), there is a signiﬁcant difference in λz values in atmospheric waves due to ice-shelf resonances with
                        distinct mode orders n (Figure 3e). Due to Earth’s rotation, numerous altitudes appear where λz = 0 for the
                        atmospheric waves that are radiated by slow waves in the ice (Figure 3e). These altitudes are the critical levels
                        where the waves are fully dissipated [Gossard and Hooke, 1975, pp. 170–181]. Presence of the critical levels
                        adds to the argument made in section 4 for why slow waves in ice are not expected to contribute appreciably
                        to the observed persistent atmospheric wave activity, especially at thermospheric altitudes. For atmospheric
                        waves that are radiated by fast waves in the ice, the combined effect of Earth’s rotation and wind leads to
                        more diversity in vertical wavelengths and somewhat stronger altitude dependence (compare Figures 3d
                        and 3e). At altitudes below 115 km, predicted λz values ﬁll the 20–30 km range in an excellent agreement with
                        observations of Chen et al. [2016].

                        6. Conclusions
                        Radiation of atmospheric waves by fundamental and other low-order resonance vibrations of large ice
                        shelves is qualitatively similar to previously considered radiation of atmospheric waves by infragravity waves
                        in ice-free water [Godin et al., 2015; Zabotin et al., 2016]. Properties of the persistent atmospheric wave
                        activity, which are observed in Antarctica in the vicinity of the Ross Ice Shelf [Chen et al., 2016], differ from
                        the properties of AGWs, which are directly generated by infragravity waves in an open ocean, because of
                        differences in the power spectra of background infragravity waves [Godin et al., 2013; Ardhuin et al., 2014]
                        and ice shelf vibrations. The key features of the persistent atmospheric wave activity reported by
                        [Chen et al., 2016], including frequency band, vertical wavelength range, and weak variation of the vertical
                        wavelength with height, can be explained by simpliﬁed models of the Ross Ice Shelf proposed in this paper.
                        It is hoped that the present work will serve as a motivation for in-depth studies of coupling between vibra-
                        tions of ice shelves and waves in the upper and middle atmosphere at high latitudes. Further research invol-
                        ving detailed numerical simulations is necessary to account for actual shape of the ice shelf and variations in
                        its thickness and ocean depth, which were ignored in the simpliﬁed models. As long as the atmospheric
                        waves are generated by the ice shelf vibrations, they reveal the low-order resonances, which can be difﬁcult
