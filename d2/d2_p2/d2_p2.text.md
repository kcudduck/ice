      I NTROD UCTION

          The propagation in sea ice of acoustic waves and pulses has been used extensively to
      investigate the elastic properties of that material (e.g. Anderson, 1958; Pounder and
      Langleben , 1964) . In these studi es it has sometimes been noted that the high-freq uency
      components tend to suffer greater attenuation than the low-frequency components, but no
      quantitative data on attenuation in sea ice a re availabl e. There have been numerous investi-
      gations however of acoustic attenuation in other pol ycrys talline substances such as m etals and
      rocks (e.g. Mason and McSkimin, 1947; Knopoff and MacDonald , 1958) and one on fresh-
      water ice (W estphal, 1965) . The latter has m easured the attenuation coefficient of g lacier ice
      over a frequency range of 2.5 kHz to 15 kHz by spectral a nal ysis of the pressure pulses from
      small explosions of seismic blasting caps. In polycrystalline materials, it has generally been
      found that the attenuation can be related to scattering at the grain boundaries and to in te rnal
      friction between the grains.
          This paper r eports on a seri es of d etail ed in situ attenuation m easurements which were
      made on the natural cover of sea ice in Tanquary Fiord , Ellesmere Island during the spring of
      1967 near the D efence R esearch Board base camp at lat. 8 I 0 25' N ., long. 76 0 50' W . Obser-
      vations were made over a frequency band extending from 10 kHz to 500 kHz using CW
      transmission along a horizonta l path . These investigati ons had been started in 1965 and a
      preliminary account of some results of the field work and of associated laboratory experiments
      has appeared in Pounder and Langleben ( 1968) .

      EXPE RIM ENTAL METHODS

          The ice cover in Tanquary Fiord was about 8 ft (2.5 m ) thick. Acoustic m easurem ents
      were made over a horizontal transmission path starting at an extreme ra nge of 25 ft (7.6 m )
      to a minimum range of 4 ft ( 1. 3 m ) . V ertical cylindrical holes were drilled in the ice cover
                                                                      399

                      to a d epth of S ft ( I.S m ) to house the sound source and the d etector, and were filled with
                      kerosen e to provide good acoustic co upling to the ice. After completion of a set of m easure-
                      m ents, a n ew hole was bored for th e detector at a lesser range from the sound source and the
                      procedure was repeated.
                           The acoustic transducers were piezoelectric barium titanate crystals in ceramic discs of
                      thi ckness t in (6 mm) with a natural frequen cy of about 4So kHz in thickness expansion.
                      Discs of 1, 4 and 6 in (2.S, 10 and IS cm ) diameter served in turn as transmitting transducers
                      and a disc of t in (1.3 cm ) diameter was used as r eceiving transducer. Each transducer was
                      encased to provide water proofing and adequate electric shielding, and in th e process the
                      resonant frequ ency was reduced by about a factor two.
                           For use, each transducer was mounted at the end of a long pole! in ( 1.9 cm) in diameter,
                      with its axis perpendicular to the length of the pole. The transducers were th en immersed to a
                      depth of 4 ft (1. 3 m ), i.e. mid-way b etween the top and bottom of the ice cover, to minimize
                      any possible boundary effects on the m ea urem ents. Optical alignment of receiving and
                      transmitting transducers was achieved by adjustment of vertical height and ol-ientation
                      fidu cial markers on the pol es.
                           The measuring system may be d escribed as follows. The sound source was driven, in CW
                      excitation, by a Hewlett Packard (HP) 6SIA oscillator through an HP467A power amplifier.
                      This oscillator was swept in frequency by an HP297A mechanical sweep drive which also
                      generated an electrical output for the X -axis deflection on an HPI3SC X- Y record er. The
                      receiving system consisted of an HP400E voltmeter, used as a pre-amplifier, HP466A and
                      4soA amplifiers in cascade and a diode d etec tor leading to th e Y-axis input of the recorder.
                      Th e gain of th e system was variable over a wide dynamic range with calibrated attenuators.
                           In operation, the oscillator was set to sweep the desired frequency band and a graph of
                      received signal as a fun ction offrequency was automatically traced out on graph paper by the
                      X- Y recorder. The procedure was repeated for each reduction in transmitter- r eceiver range.
                      Care was taken to ensure that th e transmitter was driven at constant voltage. In this way, no
                      absolute power measurements were necessary to d etermine changes in received power or
                      intensity level with changes in length of transmission path.


                      OBSE RVATIONS AND RESU LTS

                          Observations of the ice cover in the vicinity of the operating site indicated that it consisted
                      oftwo-year-old ice of thickness about 8 ft (2.S m ) . Its salinity along the tl-ansmission path was
                      about o. I % by weight and its temperature at the sam e depth about - 6°C . Horizontal and
                      verti cal th in sections revealed the typical structure of sea ice, crystals long in the growth
                      direction perpendicular to the surface and of horizontal dimensions varying from about I cm
                      to greater than S cm. The typical crystal size in the horizontal was about 2 cm.
                          M easurements of relative signal intensity level were made at receiver- transmitter ranges
                      of2S, 20,18,16, IS, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, sand 4 ft (7·5, 6.1 , S·S, 4·9, 4.6, 4,3,3.6,3.0, 2.{, 1.8, I.S
                      and 1.3 m ) in the order given. At each range, the frequency was swept over the band 10 kHz
                      to soo kHz. Three such series of measurements were performed using in turn as transmitter,
                      the I in (2.S cm), 4 in (10 cm) and 6 in (IS cm ) transducers. Detectable signal was obtained
                      over a considerable band of frequency at all of the twelve ranges used, particularly with the
                      two larger transducers (Figures I, 2 and 3) . At high frequencies where the attenuation was
                      severe, signal merged with background noise at the more distant ranges. At low frequencies,
                      far removed from the resonant frequency of the encased transmitting transducers, the acoustic
                      power output was low and once again the signal could not be distinguished from noise at the
                      more distant ranges used.
                          The data analysis for each series of measurements was handled in the following manner.
                      Values of recorded signal intensity level were read off the graphs at the grid points of the

                      slopes should have established values of the attenuation coeffi cient and its vanatlOn with
                      frequ ency. However, som e of the data points on the graphs were obviously spurious, a not
                      uncommon occurrence in acoustical measurem ents. Points which d eviated most from the
                      line of best fit were removed one by one, recalcu la ting a new line of best fit each time, until
                      the scatter was limited to within 3 db.
                          Th e final results of this procedure are shown in Figures I , 2 and 3 for the three series of

                      abscissa is the length of the transmission path or range in feet. The series of graphs disp lay the
                      measured points and the lines of best fit at the various frequencies. The two columns beside

       attenuation coefficients in db m - I ( I db m - I = 0.115 nepers m - I) which are equal to the
       negative of the slope of the lines of best fit . Th e trend indicated in these figures is that the
       attenuation coefficient increases with increasing frequency, i. e. that the slope becomes pro-
       gressively more negative. Since attenuation is a property of the m edium and not of the
       m easuring system , the data of Figures I to 3 were combined , weighting the slopes at each
       frequency according to the number of points used to establish the slopes. The results are
       plotted as points in Figure 4 for attenuation coefficien t (db m - I) against frequency (kHz) .
       It is seen that a ttenuation is an ever rapidly increasing function offrequency. The attenuation
       coefficient increases from a value of less than I db m - I at 10 kH z, to about 5 db m - I at
       100 kHz and to more than 35 db m - I at 500 kHz. As comparison, Westphal ( 1965) obtained
       a value for th e attenuation coefficient of 0.2 IS nepers m - I ( 1.9 db m - I) at IS kHz in glacier ice.
            A considerable body of evidence exists (e.g. Mason, 1964, p . 163) to indicate that in
       polycrystalline materials the attenuation may vary as the sum of two frequency-dependent
       term s. One involves a linear d ependency on frequency and is caused by frictional loss
       mechanisms between grains. The o ther is a term in the fourth power of the frequency a nd
       arises from scattering at the grain boundaries caused by discontinuities in the elastic constants
       in going from one crystal to the adjacent one. The data of Figure 4 were accordingly fitted ,
       using the least-squares m ethod, by an equation of the form
                                                                 ex = cr!+ c2f4
        where ex is the attenuation coefficient, j is th e frequency, c, = 4.45 X 10- 2 db m - I kHz- I,
        and C2 = 2.18 X 10- 10 db m - I kHz - 4.
            I t is seen that the curve fits the data points r easonably well. The points seem to follow a
        series of oscillations above the curve which may be caused by thermal relaxation processes .
        However no attempt was mad e to investigate these features .

        DISCUSSIO N
             Calculations indicate that the linear term in the above equation is the predominant one
        in the frequency band studied. It accounts for more than 99.9 % of th e attenuation at fre-
        quencies below 60 kHz, for 99 % at abo ut 120 kHz, for 90 % at somewhat less than 300 kHz
        and for 60 % at about 500 kHz . This result is not entirely unexp ected when one considers that
        sea ice has a complicated substructure of platelets with h eavy concentration of liquid brine in
        cells between the platelets and also numerous air bubbles . The brine cells, air bubbles,
        platelets and even grains may act as sites of strain concentration resulting from passage of the
        acoustic pressure wave. Savage ( 1965) points o ut that localized temperature fluctuations
        would be induced at such sites and that the diffusion of these flu ctuations by conduction
        produ ces the loss m echanism which h e calls thermoelastic internal fri ction.
             As for the scattering term, since the velocity of compressional waves in sea ice of the
        properties encountered is about 3.7 X 10 3 m s- ' (Langleben, 1962 ), the wavelength of the
        acoustic waves approaches the typical horizontal dimension of the ice crystals, about 2 cm ,
        a t a frequency of approximately 130 kHz. It would thus appear that, in a lossy medium such
        as sea ice, Rayleigh-type scattering is insignificant compared wi th other loss mechanisms until
        frequencies having wavelengths very much less than the average crystal size are attained .
