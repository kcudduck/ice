ATTENUATION OF SOUND IN SEA ICE, 10 500kHz 403
attenuation cocflicients in dbm ' (1 dbm ! 0.115 nepers m-') which are equal o the
negative of the slope of the lines of best fit. The trend indicated in these figures is that the
attenuation cocflicient inereases with increasing frequency. i, that the slope becomes pro-
gressively more negative. Since attenuation is a property of the medium and not of the
measuring system, the data of Figures 110 5 were combined. weighting the slopes at cach
frequency according to the number of pomts used 1o establish the slopes. The resulis are
plotted as points in Figure 4 for attenuation cocflicient (dbm ') against frequency (kHz ).
[t is seen that attenuation is an ever rapidly increasing function of frequency. The attenuation
coeflicient increases from a value of less than 1 dbm ' at 10 klz 0 about 5dbm
100 kHz and to more than 35 db m " at 500 kHz. As comparison. Westphal (1965 obtained
avalue for the attenuation cocflicient of 0.215 nepersm ' ing dbmofaty kHz in glacier ice.

A considerable body of evidence exists (c.g. Mason, 1964, p. 1650 1o indicate that in

polyerystalline materials the attenuation may vary as the sum of two frequency-dependent
terms. One involves a linear dependency on frequency and is caused by frictional loss
mechanisms between grains. The other is a termi in the fourth power of the frequency and
arises from scattering at the grain boundaries caused by discontinuities in the elastic constants
in going from onc crystal to the adjacent one. The data of Figure 4 were accordingly fitted,
using the least-squares method, by an cquation of the form
x = of eyt

where » is the attenuation coeflicient, /" is the frequency, ¢, 145 1o rdbm "kHz .
and c. — 2.8 <10 "dbm "kllz 4

Ttis seen that the curve fits the data points reasonably well. The points seem o follow a
series of oscillations above the curve which may be caused by thermal relaxation processes.
However no attempt was made 10 investigate these features,

Discussion

Calculations indicate that the lincar term in the above cquation is the predominant one
in the frequency band studied. Tt accounts for more than 99.9",, ol the attenuation at fre-
quencies below 6o kHz, for 9o, at about 120 kHz. for G0 at somewhat less than 300 kHz
and for 60", at about 500 kllz. This result is not entirely unexpected when one considers that
sea ice has a complicated substructure of platelets with heavy concentration of liquid brine in
cells between the platelets and also numerous air bubbles, The brine cells, air bubbles,
platelets and even grains may act as sites of strain concentration resulting from passage of the
acoustic pressure wave.  Savage (1965 points out that localized temperature fluctuations
would be induced at such sites and that the diffusion of these fluctuations by conduction
produces the Toss mechanism which he calls thermoclastic internal friction.

As for the scattering term, since the velocity of compressional waves in sea ice of the
properties encountered is about 3.7 - 1o ms ! Langleben, 1962, the wavelength of the
acoustic waves approaches the typical horizontal dimension of the ice crystals. about 2 cm,
at a frequency of approximately 150 kHz. It would thus appear that, in a lossy medium such
as sea ice, Rayleigh-type scattering is insignificant compared with other loss mechanisims until
frequencies having wavelengths very much less than the average crystal size are attained.
