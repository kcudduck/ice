uncommon occurrence in acoustical measurements. Points which deviated most from the

The final results of this procedure are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 for the three series off
measurements with transmitting transducers of respectively 6, 4 and 1in (15, 10 and 2.5 cm)
diameter. In cach diagram, the ordinate is received signal as intensity level in decibels and the
abscissa is the length of the transmission path or range in feet. The series of graphs display the
measured points and the lines of best fit at the various frequencies. The two columns beside
the graphs list the relevant frequencies in order of increasing magnitude and the corresponding
