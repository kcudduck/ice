o a depth of 5t (1.5 m) o house the sound source and the detector, and were filled with
kerosene to provide good acoustic coupling o the ice. Afier completion of a st of measure-
ments. a new hole was bored for the detector at a lesser range from the sound source and the
procedure was repeated.

The acoustic transducers were piezoelectric harium titanate crystals i ceramic dises off
thickness Pin (6 mm) with a nataral frequency of about j50 kHz in thickness expansion.
Dises of 1. pand 6 in (2.5, 10 and 15 cm) diameter served in turn as transmitting transducers
and a disc of Lin (1.5 cm) diameter was used as receiving transducer. Fach transducer was
cncased o provide water proofing and adequate clectric shielding. and in the process the
resonant frequency was reduced by about a factor two.

For use. cach transducer was mounted at the end of a long pole §in (1. e in diameter,
with its axis perpendicular 1o the length of the pole. The transducers were then immersed 1o a
depth of 4 it (g mL ies mid-way between the top and bottom of the ice cover. 1o minimize
any possible boundary effects on the measurements. Optical alignment ol receiving and
transmitting transducers was achieved by adjusunent of vertical height and orientation
fiducial markers on the poles.

The measuring system may be deseribed as follows. The sound source was driven. in C\W
excitation, by a Hewlewt Packard (HP) 651\ oscillator through an TIP467.\ power amplifier.
This oscillator was swept in frequency by an HP297.A mechanical sweep drive which also
generated an clectrical output for the N-axis deflection on an HP135C A 1 recorder. The
receiving system consisted of an HPgooE volimeter, used as a pre-amplifier, HP 66\ and
150\ amplifiers in cascade and a diode detector leading to the T-axis input of the recorder.
Ihe gain of the system was variable over a wide dynamic range with calibrated atienuators.

In operation, the oscillator was set to sweep the desired frequency band and a graph of
received signal as a function of frequency was automatically traced out on graph paper by the
X Precorder. The procedure was repeated for cach reduction N transmitter- receiver range.,
Care was taken to ensure that the transmitter was driven at constant voltage. In this way. no
absolute power measurenients were necessary o determine changes in received power or
intensity level with changes in length of transmission path.

OBSERVATIONS AND REsvrrs

Observations of the ice cover in the vicinity of the operating site indicated that it consisted
of two-year-old ice of thickness about 8 [t (2.5 m). Tis salinity along the transmission path was
about 0.1, by weight and its temperature at the same depth about — 6 C. Horizontal and
vertical thin sections revealed the typical structure of sea ice. crystals long in the growth
divection perpendicular 1o the surface and of horizontal dimensions varying from about 1 cm
to greater than 5 em. The typical crystal size in the horizontal was about 2 cm.

Measurements of relative signal intensity level were made at receiver transmitter ranges
ol25. 20,18, 16, 15, 14, 12, 10, 8,6, 5 and 4 [ (7.6, 6.1, 5.5. 1.9, 1.6, 4.3. 3.6, 5.0, 2.4, 1.8, 1.5
and 1.3 m) in the order given. At cach range, the frequency was swept over the band 1o klHz
to 500 kHz. Three such series of measurements were performed using in furn as transmitter,
the 1in (2.5 cm). 4 in (1o cm) and 6 in (15 cm) transducers. Detectable signal was obtained
over a considerable band of frequency at all of the twelve ranges used. particularly with the
two larger transducers (Figures 1, 2 and 3. At high frequencies where the attenuation was
severe, signal merged with background noise at the more distant ranges. At low frequencics,
far removed from the resonant frequency of the encased transmitting transducers, the acoustic
power output was low and once again the signal could not be distinguished from noise at the
more distant ranges used.

The data analysis for each series of measurements was handled in the following manner.
Values of recorded signal intensity level were read ofl the graphs at the grid points of the
