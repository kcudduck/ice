        Some solid, crystalline materials exhibit the piezoelectric effect, which is very interesting for a variety of technological
        applications. Piezoelectric materials are widely used in electromechanical sensors and actuators, such as robotics’ sensors,
        actuators, ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The paper presents the modeling of the
        piezoelectric effect in quartz, which is the most widely used material. The basic ideas of the finite-element method (FEM) for
        solving the problem of piezoelectric media are presented. All the results are based on linear piezoelectricity, in which the elastic,
        piezoelectric, and dielectric coefficients are treated as constants, independent of the magnitude and frequency of the applied
        mechanical stresses and electric fields. Starting with the tri-dimensional finite-element method, we have developed a numerical
        computational method for a determination of the electrical voltage (the direct piezoelectric effect) and the eigenmodes of
        vibration (the inverse piezoelectric effect).
        The finite-element method is normally used for solving problems related to macrostructures. The aim of this work is to show
        that the finite-element method (FEM) is also a useful and convenient method for solving problems in relation to microstructures.
        Here we present the solution to the problem of the piezoelectric effect using the FEM, approaching the problem from the
        microstructural point of view.

transformation of mechanical energy into electric energy.

we have calculated the potential difference as a function
of depth. But, for practical reasons, we have not taken
into account the fact that the opposite sides of the
