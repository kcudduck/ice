Abstract
A promising solution to reduce energy usage and mitigate the wear of drilling and comminution tools during mining opera-
tions involves inducing vibrations within the piezoelectric phases dispersed in the structure of rocks using alternating current
(AC). This paper presents experimental evidence of AC-induced weakening of Kuru granite, manifested as improvements in
rock drillability and reductions of strength. Sievers’ J-miniature drill tests were used to assess surface drillability. The impact
of AC treatment on the quasi-static strength of granite was assessed via three-point bending and indirect tension Brazilian
disk tests. The influence of AC treatment on the dynamic tensile strength of the rock was determined using split Hopkinson
bar tests, with the fragmentation process captured using in situ ultra-fast synchrotron X-ray phase contrast imaging. The
quasi-static tests revealed no reduction in rock strength after the AC treatment. In contrast, reductions of 25% in hardness
and 18% in dynamic tensile strength were observed. Fragmentation patterns differed between treated and non-treated rocks,
with treated specimens exhibiting reduced macrocrack formation during loading.

Highlights
•    Diverse experiments confirm that alternating current excitations weaken Granite.
•    Sievers’ J-tests evidenced enhanced drillability of Granite after the alternating current treatment.
•    Exposure to alternating currents decreased the tensile strength of Granite in dynamic Brazilian disc experiments.
•    Treated Brazilian disc specimens showed lower energy absorption during dynamic loading.
•    Synchrotron X-ray phase contrast images revealed reduced crack branching of treated granite specimens during dynamic
     loading.
