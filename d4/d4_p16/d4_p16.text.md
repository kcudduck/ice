Abstract
Piezoelectric excitation of quartz mineral phase in granite using high-frequency and high-voltage alternating current (HF-
HV-AC) is a potential new weakening pretreatment in comminution of rock. The present study addresses this topic numeri-
cally by quantifying the weakening effect on the compressive strength of granite. For this end, a numerical method based
on a damage-viscoplasticity model for granite failure under piezoelectric actuation is developed. The rock material is
modelled as heterogeneous and isotropic. However, the piezoelectric properties of quartz are anisotropic. The governing
global piezoelectro-mechanical problem is solved in a staggered manner explicitly in time. Numerical simulations predict
that the weakening effect on compressive strength of granite is 10% with the excitation frequency and voltage of 274.4 kHz
and 150 kV of the pretreatment. As the weakening effect takes place at a natural frequency of the numerical rock sample,
the quartz content has only a slight effect on the frequency at which maximum weakening occurs. Moreover, the weaken-
ing effect depends strongly on the orientation of the quartz crystals. In a more practical application of simulating low-rate
compression of a sphere-shaped rock sample, a weakening effect of 8% after the HF-HV-AC pretreatment was predicted.

Highlights

• Substantial damage can be induced on granite by piezoelectric excitation by high-voltage and high-frequency alternating
     current.
•    This pretreatment by piezoelectricity of quartz can be used to weaken granite samples before mechanical comminution.
•    The frequency of the excitation needs to match one of the natural frequencies of the rock sample.
•    A weakening effect of 10% on the compressive strength can be achieved at frequency of 274 kHz and voltage of 150 kV.
•    Experimental validation of the theoretical/numerical predictions is needed.
