                               2. Fundamentals of the Piezoelectric Effect
                               2.1. Mechanism of the Piezoelectric Effect
                                    The common characteristic of piezoelectric materials is that their crystalline structures
                               contain crystal lattices that lack center symmetry [8,9]. Piezoelectric properties include the
                               direct piezoelectric effect and the reversed piezoelectric effect. The direct piezoelectric effect
                               refers to the phenomenon where, under an external load, polarization produced by the
                               inner center of positive charges and the center of negative charges undergoes displacement,
                               and the reverse signs of the charges are produced at the two ends of dielectric surfaces.
                               Under an external force (within a certain range), the charge density of the piezoelectric
                               material is proportional to the external force, which can be defined as:

                                                                           δ = dT

                                    δ is the facial charge density, d is the piezoelectric strain constant and T is stretching
                               stress. On the contrary, the reversed piezoelectric effect is denoted as when an electrical
                               field is imposed on piezoelectric materials, and the inner center of positive charges and
                               the center of negative charges undergo displacement. Consequently, polarization occurs
                               and generates a strain on the material. As the magnitude of the electrical field is within a
                               defined range, the magnitude of stress and the output electrical signal turn out to have a
                               linear relationship: x = dE.
                                    x is the strain, E is defined as the electric field and d is assigned as the reverse piezo-
                               electric strain constant.
                                    The magnitude of the piezoelectric energy can reflect the coupling constants of the
                               elastic properties and the dielectric properties, defined as the electromechanical coupling
                               coefficient, which can be expressed as follows:
                                                                              s
                                                                                   u212
                                                                         K=                                                  (1)
                                                                                  u1 u2

                                     u12 is defined as the piezoelectric energy, u1 is assigned as the elastic energy and u2 is
                               defined as the dielectric energy.
                                     Under an electrical field, the electrical displacement D of non-piezoelectric mate-
                               rials under a free-standing state (no external force) is given as: D = εE, where ε is as-
                               signed as the dielectric coefficient of the dielectric medium. In the absence of an electrical
                               field, when stress T is imposed upon the non-piezoelectric materials, strain S is induced.
                               The relationship is shown as: S = sT, where s is assigned as a flexible constant.
                                     The relationship between the electrical and mechanical straining of piezoelectric
                               materials can be described as D = dT + εE (positive piezoelectric effect)

                                                        S = sE T + dE (negative piezoelectric effect)

                                   Taking ZnO as an example [10] (as shown in Figure 1a), the 2p orbital of Zn cations and
                               O2− anions are included in a crystal lattice. In a free-standing state, due to the overlapping

                               between the center of the positive charges Zn2+ and the center of the negative charges O2− ,
                               the dipole moment is zero. If an external force is imposed on the crystal lattice of ZnO,
                               the dipole moment is produced by the relative displacements of the centers of the O2−
                               and the Zn2+ . The dipole moments of every crystal lattice bring about electric potential at
                               the macroscopic level, which can be defined as piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) (as
                               shown in Figure 1a).

                               2.2. Piezotronics
                                    When imposed upon by an external force at the microscopic level, piezoelectric po-
                               tential (piezopotential) is established within the inner structure of the materials, with
                               the surface charges redistributed and the polarization phenomenon produced. As two
                               electrodes sandwich this piezoelectric material, a piezopotential-driving transient current
                               of electrons is produced under the external load. With the development of electronic
                               devices triggered or controlled by strains (e.g., force, pressure) and sensors based on the
                               piezoelectric effect, an edge-cutting discipline has sprung up—Piezotronics [11,12].
                                    Effect field transistors (FET) are an important representation of piezotronic devices.
                               As shown in Figure 1b [13], a constant voltage is applied to the two ends of piezoelectric
                               nanowire material as a source-drain voltage. Piezoelectric potential is generated via the
                               external-pressure-induced deformation of nanowire (a tensile strain in the upper panel of
                               Figure 1b, and a compress strain in the bottom panel of Figure 1b) and serves as a gate
                               voltage. That is, piezoelectric potential that is applied to the channel of FET is equivalent
                               to a gate voltage applied to the channel of FET. The piezoelectric potential changes the
                               Schottky barrier at the source side. As shown in Figure 1c, the SBH at the source side
                               reduces from ϕs to ϕs 0 ≈ ϕs − ∆EP in the tensile deformation (outward deformation) state.
                               As shown in Figure 1d, the SBH at the source side raises from ϕs to ϕs ” ≈ ϕs + ∆EP 0 in the
                               compressive deformation (outward deformation) state.

                               2.3. Piezophototronics
                                    Piezophototronics is an interdisciplinary subset of piezoelectricity, photonic ex-
                               citation and the science of semiconductors. Piezophototronics is the discipline of
                               investigating the devices which work through tailoring or controlling the electro-
                               optical process by strain-induced piezoelectric potential. Piezophototronics has gained
                               a wide application in photoelectric devices (e.g., light-emitting diodes, photocells
                               and solar cells) owing to its improvements to the performances of photoelectric de-
                               vices [14,15]. The candidate for piezotronics and piezophototronics is mainly the
                               wurtzite family [16,17]. To guarantee the balanced injection of heterogeneous junc-
                               tions, which is heavily related to the efficiency of a LED, the piezophototronic effect
                               can be employed to address the issue of the difficulty (due to band alignment and
                               various material properties) of injecting an equal amount of electrons and holes into
                               the space-charge region. For instance, Yang et al. [16] constructed a hybrid LED using
                               an n-type ZnO and a p-type PEDOT:PSS (as show in Figure 1e). As shown in Figure 1e,
                               the PEDOT:PSS coated half of the ZnO NW on a flexible substrate with separated
                               gold electrode pads. As the substrate bended, ZnO NW generated piezopotential.
                               The middle and bottom panel of Figure 1e present the simulated results of the distribu-
                               tion of the piezopotential. Figure 1f illustrates the experimental results of the I-V curve,
                               suggesting that positive and negative piezocharges can be induced at the respective
                               interfaces of the heterojunction.

                               of these special piezoelectric materials.

                               3.1. The Principle of Piezoelectricity at High Temperatures
                                    The symmetry of a crystal is determined by its lattice, which is strictly bounded by the
                               regulation of the inner structure of the crystal and the brave protocell, which involves the
                               Emnoman principle. The Emnoman principle, [18,19] states that the physical symmetry of
                               any crystal are included with the symmetry of its crystal point group. When the crystal
                               experiences deformation under a mechanical force, the charged positive ions or negative
                               ions of the inner crystal are displaced, which causes the overall electrical dipole moments
                               to change. In each type of point group with center symmetry, the arrangements of the
                               symmetry centers of the ions are not susceptible to being destroyed, and therefore the
                               centers of the ions are not displaced. If the point group of the crystal has hetero-pole center
                               symmetry in absence of homo-pole center symmetry, the overall electrical dipole moments
                               of the crystal change upon the application of the mechanical force.
                                    The piezoelectric crystal contains a pyroelectric crystal with its surface charged by
                               temperatures varied in a uniform style, indicating that spontaneous polarization occurs in
                               the crystal. When the crystal experiences thermal expanding, the relative displacements of
                               the positive and negative ions change the spontaneous polarization in a unique pole axis of
                               the crystal. In regard to pyroelectric crystals, some crystals only experience spontaneous
                               polarization in specific temperature ranges, and the external electrical field can reverse the
                               intensity of the spontaneous polarization, making the crystal ferroelecric.
                                    Pyroelectric crystals can be regarded as a thermodynamic system, with unified rela-
                               tionships between its thermal parameters, mechanical parameters and electrical parameters.
                               The system is in a thermal isolation state with no entropy change due to the fast con-
                               version rate between the mechanical parameters and electrical parameters to overlapped
                               thermal exchanges.

                               3.2. The Factors of the Piezoelectric Nanocomposites Required to Be Considered for Application at
                               High Temperatures
                                    High-temperature sensors are a core part of high-temperature, mechanically controlled
                               systems. The stability of the sensors that are applied in high temperatures is closely related
                               to the properties of piezoelectric materials.
                               (1)   Phase transition may make the properties of the materials fluctuate as the temper-
                                     ature changes.
                               (2)   Resistivity interferes with the migration of surficial changes induced by the piezo-
                                     electric effect.
                               (3)   Thermal stability.
                               (4)   The acoustic wave decays in high temperatures and with dielectric losses.
                               (5)   Chemical stability.
                               (6)   The component decomposition and the lattice-defect formation [20–22].
                                    Among the above six factors, the most significant factor is the phase transition. For ex-
                               ample, GaPO4 is a kind of high-temperature piezoelectric crystal material with outstanding
                               properties: high resistivity and low dielectric loss. However, the crystal undergoes phase
                               transition near 930 ◦ C, limiting its application in high temperatures. As another example,
                               the piezoelectric coefficient of AlN is desirable and has no phase transition near 930 ◦ C.
                               Nevertheless, the undesired crystal defects (stemming from a physical gas-phase growth
                               procedure) also decreases its resistivity and limits its upper-limitation temperature. For
                               instance, high resistivity and high RC time constants are required for high-temperature
                               sensors. Higher RC time constants give rise to a longer time period for the charges to stay
                               in the sensor. The longer retention time of the charges is feasible to be detected. Moreover,
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                           6 of 32




                               the minimum effective frequency heavily depends on the RC time constant. The lower

                                    Below this value, the induced charges may vanish before being detected. Higher RC
                               time constants may facilitate the sensors operating in lower frequencies. With respect to
                               LN crystals, though the electromechanical coupling coefficient is greater and the Tc reaches
                               1170 ◦ C, the resistivity of the materials is relatively lower, making them usable only in
                               temperatures below 600 ◦ C [20]. Besides phase transition and resistivity, thermal stability,
                               the decaying of the acoustic wave in high temperatures, dielectric loss and chemical stability
                               are also important factors that are supposed to be given emphasis.

                               4. What Are the Limiting Factors in Using Piezoelectric Materials at
                               High Temperatures?
                                      The number of dielectric constants is associated with symmetry. A high symmetry
                               is associated with smaller dielectric constants, which are the smallest for triclinic systems
                               with high symmetry. A triclinic system has six independent dielectric constants: ε11 , ε12 ,
                               ε13 , ε22 , ε23 and ε33 . The symmetry of the cub system is highest. The cub system has only
                               one independent dielectric constant: ε11 .
                                      Untreated piezoelectric materials are comprised of anisotropic poly-crystals, and
                               transform to an anisotropic dielectric medium after treatment. The x axis and y axis are
                               the non-polarization axis and the xy plane is the isotropic plane. There is no difference
                               between the x axis and y axis. However, the z axis is totally different. The symmetry of
                               polarization-treated piezoelectric ceramics is equivalent to the symmetry of a cylinder.
                               The xy plane is an anisotropic plane rather than a isotropic plane. The most important
                               parameter to characterize the piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric materials is the
                               piezoelectric coefficient: dij .

                                                                  Ns Z ∗ a 

                                                                   kB T

                               where T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, Ns is the total number of five-
                               atom cells composing the supercell and Z* is the Born effective charge associated with the
                               soft mode and the five-atom lattice constant. ui is the i-component of the supercell average
                               of the local mode at a given MC sweep, and ZH,j is the j component of the homogeneous
                               strain tensor (in Voigt notation) at this MC sweep. The ϕH,j symbol denotes statistical
                               averages over the different MC sweeps [23].
                                    Li et al. reported [24] piezoelectric ceramics with Ba2+ substituted for Ca2 Nb2 O7 .
                               The detections from XRD and Raman characterization indicated that the solid-dissolve
                               limitation is 0.3. However, the piezoelectric coefficient was not reported. Gao et al. devel-
                               oped [25] a piezoelectric ceramic of Sr2–x Bax Nb2 O7 by SPS with Ba2+ doping, increasing
                               d33 to 3.6 pC/N. Moreover, the non-in-situ annealing experiment suggested the thermal
                               annealing polarization temperature was above 1150 ◦ C. They further prepared the textual-
                               ized Ce3+ -doping piezoelectric ceramics with La2 Ti2 O7 and successfully promoted d33 to
                               3.9 pC/N.
                                    The dij is a parameter from the macro-scope viewpoint, but on other hand, from the
                               micro-scope viewpoint, the theoretical expression of the total internal energy is effectively
                               Hamiltonian and contains a local-mode self-energy, a long-range dipole–dipole interaction,
                               a short-range interaction between soft modes, an elastic energy and an interaction between
                               the local modes and local strains [26]. In particular, the local-mode self-energy is given by:

                               4.1. Curie Temperature
                               4.1.1. The Importance of the Curie Temperature
                                     The Curie temperature refers to the temperature at which the spontaneous magne-
                               tizations of magnetic nanocomposite materials decrease to zero, and is the critical point
                               at which ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic nanocomposite materials become paramagnetic.
                               The Curie temperature (TC ) determines whether piezoelectric materials can apply to high-
                               temperature devices due to the fact that, above the Curie temperature, most piezoelectric
                               materials for high-temperature application lose their piezoelectricity, providing a non-trivial
                               limitation for their utilization in relatively low temperatures.
                                     It is widely acknowledged that PZT has advantages including a large piezoelectric
                               coefficient, high piezoelectric polarizability, excellent stability and low cost. However, the
                               loss of piezoelectric characteristics at the Curie temperature (TC ) limits their application at
                               high temperatures, which is the untrivial problem for its application in occasions of elevated
                               temperatures. PVDF exhibits very low thermal stability (melting at 177 ◦ C), let alone being
                               able to maintain stability at its Curie temperature, suggesting its unsuitability for operating
                               in high temperatures. A high Curie temperature is the prerequisite of great significance
                               for piezoelectric nanocomposites in high-temperature applications. For example, among
                               the large quantity of high-temperature piezoelectric materials, bismuth layer-structured
                               ferroelectrics [28] (BLSFs, also called Aurivillius phase compounds) have been the most
                               appealing material for applications in piezoelectric sensors at high temperatures, owing to
                               its incomparably high Curie temperature
                                     The Curie temperature has a profound influence on the performance of piezoelectric
                               materials. It is worth noting that the Curie temperature is strongly related to de-polarization,
                               which may occur when the practical operate temperature is much lower than the Curie
                               temperature. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and the de-polarization temperature
                               determine the highest temperature at which piezoelectric materials can be used. As an
                               example, Liao et al. [29] have reported Bi2 WO6 , as the simplest member of the Aurivillius-
                               based piezoelectric materials, and improved it to possess an ultra-high depolarization
                               temperature and an ultra-high Curie temperature.

                               4.1.2. The Effect on the Curie Temperature of Piezoelectric Composites for
                               High-Temperature Applications
                               (a)   The instinct of materials
                                     Among the piezoelectric materials that possess a high Curie temperature, perovskite
                               layer-structured (PLS) piezoelectric ceramics have gained increasing interest due to its
                               good thermal stability [30].
                                     With its unparalleled high Curie temperature, PLS piezoelectric ceramics have become
                               the hot topics in the field of high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics. (e.g., Sr2 Nb2 O7 and
                               Pr2 Ti2 O7 possess the Curie temperature of 1342 ◦ C and 1555 ◦ C [31]). The PLS piezoelectric
                               ceramics also possess ultrahigh electrical resistivity (higher than bismuth layer-structured
                               piezoelectric ceramic, perovskite and LiNbO3 single crystals by two-to-four orders of
                               magnitude [32,33]).
                               (b)   Inner structure
                                    The high Curie temperature of piezoelectric materials is closely related to their inner
                               structure. Wu et al. [34] developed high-temperature piezoelectricity materials from the
                               (1−x−y)K1-w NawNb1−z Sbz O3-x BiFeO3 −yBi0.5 Na0.5 ZrO3 (KNwNSz-x BF-y BNZ) ceramics.
                               The most outstanding characteristic of this material is its extremely high Curie temperature,
                               which is realized by optimizing x, y, z and w. The characterization indicated that the high
                               TC was associated with the phase structure. To be specific, the intimate coexistence of
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                             8 of 32




                               the rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases inside the nanodomains was detected
                               by atomic-resolution polarization and mapped by Z-contrast imaging. The high Curie
                               temperature can be explained by the nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy, which in
                               turn lowers the domain wall energy and makes the polarization rotation between different
                               states easier.
                                    In addition, the Curie temperature is also closely related to the amount of the second
                               phase. A small amount of the second phase and the solid solution turns out to create
                               trigonal distortions in a crystal structure and generally disappear as the x increase.
                               (c)   The morphotropic phase boundary (MPB)
                                     A hot topic concerns why the materials in the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB)
                               possess exceptional properties. The MPB is the co-existence of the square syngony domain
                               with the tetragonal syngony domain, and the free energy difference between them is very
                               small. This structure, with regard to spontaneous polarization, can be feasible for experi-
                               encing crystallographic change transitions under the external electric field, leading to the
                               field-induced phase transition phenomenon. As a result, the migration and polarization of
                               active ferroelectrics may be dramatically facilitated. Therefore, the dielectric constant and
                               piezoelectric coefficient reach their maximum value. Additionally, due to the MPB facilitat-
                               ing ion migration, the electric domain movements become easier in PZT ceramic with an
                               MPB and the mechanical loss energy increases, leading to lower Qm. Noheda et al. [35]
                               made a great breakthrough in the knowledge of MPBs by investigating Pb(Zr0.52 Ti0.48 ).
                               Their measurements indicated that as the temperature decreased from 736 K to 300 K, the
                               original cubic phase of the crystal became a tetragonal phase, and became a monoclinic
                               phase below 200 K.
                               (d)   The tolerance factor
                                    The tolerance factor can be employed to predict the Curie temperature. The smaller
                               the tolerance factor, the higher the Curie temperature.
                                    The tolerance factor t = √2r(Ar++r0r ) [36].
                                                                  B   0
                                     The tolerance factor can be used to justify the stability and phase structure, and in a
                               typical cubic perovskite is 1. The range of t for a stable perovskite structure is 0.88–1.09. As
                               t < 1, trigonal distortion crystals play a dominant role, while as t > 1, tetragonal crystals
                               occupy a dominant position.
                                     MPB is located at the position with PT content 64mol% d33 = 460 pC/N and the
                               electromechanical coupling coefficient kp = 0.56, equivalent to a PZT possessing a Curie
                               temperature of 450 ◦ C. Eitel et al. [37] predicted the BiInO3, MPB component of a solid-
                               solution complex of BiYbO3 and PbTiO3 are 550 ◦ C and 650 ◦ C, respectively.
                               (e)   The morphology of piezoelectric materials
                                     Curie temperature is also strongly related to the lattice potential energy of the crys-
                               talline properties, and further affects the morphology of the crystalline properties of the
                               piezoelectric materials. Therefore, designing the microstructure of piezoelectric materials
                               is a reasonable method for tailoring their Curie temperatures. However, the comprehen-
                               sive acquaintances of the ferro-/piezoelectric properties of bismuth scandate–lead titanate
                               (BS–PT) have been dramatically prohibited by a shortage of information, especially re-
                               garding microstructures, and are incompatible with the growth of high-quality crystals.
                               Luo et al. [38] explored the microstructure of BT–PT crystals near the morphotropic phase
                               boundary from a microscopic perspective. The multi-level domain structures in the h001icub
                               BS–PT single crystals were detected by an integration of temperature-variable birefringence
                               imaging microscopy and piezo-response force microscopy, combined with a high-resolution
                               X-ray diffraction in the temperature range of 30–500 ◦ C. The crystals turned out to have
                               temperature-dependent morphologies. Specifically speaking, at room temperature, the
                               morphologies of the crystals showed a tetragonal symmetry, while at the higher tempera-

                               4.1.3. The Approach for Improving the Curie Temperature of Piezoelectric
                               Nanocomposites for High-Temperature Applications
                               (a)   Doping
                                     Doping is a general method for promoting Tc. For example, Chen et al. [39] sys-
                               tematically synthesized CaBi2 Nb2 O9 -based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics using
                               co-doped Mo/Cr, demonstrating that the co-dopant method has effectively improved the
                               Curie temperature (reaching to an ultrahigh Tc of ~939 ◦ C) and thermal stability.
                                     As another instance, Guo et al. [40] fabricated high-temperature piezoelectric materials
                               using BiFeO3 –BaTiO3 –NdCoO3 with multiferroic characteristics and carried out a system-
                               atic study on the structural, piezoelectric and multiferroic features of the materials. It was
                               mentioned that the addition of 1.0–3.0 mol% NdCoO3 elevated the Curie temperature from
                               486 ◦ C to 605 ◦ C, which can be explained by the morphotropic phase boundary of the
                               rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases.
                               (b)   Optimized composition
                                    Besides doping, optimized composition is a common method to increase Curie tem-
                               perature. As an instance, Guo Q. H. et al. [41] have broadened the range of operation
                               temperatures for Sm-modified 0.15 Pb(Mg1/3 Nb2/3 )O3 -(0.85-x)PbZrO3 -xPbTiO3 by deli-
                               cately designing the composition.

                               4.1.4. Improving the Curie Temperature of Piezoelectric Nanocomposites Is Not Supposed
                               to Deteriorate the Other Properties
                                    Admittedly, scientists all make unremitting endeavors to pursue higher Curie tem-
                               peratures. It is worth mentioning that the improvement of the Curie temperature is not
                               supposed to deteriorate the other properties. On the other hand, the improved other
                               properties besides Curie temperature are not supposed to have a negative impact on Curie
                               temperature. However, the pursuit of higher Curie temperatures has generally deteriorated
                               other performance properties. For example, un-doped perovskite displays a high Curie
                               temperature (Tc) with shortcomings of a rather low mechanical quality factor (Qm ), which
                               may decrease its energy conversion efficiency. In response to this issue, Wang et al. [42]
                               endeavored to improve the mechanical quality factor (Qm ) of the piezoelectric ceramic
                               BYPT-PZN-xMn by deeply analyzing the microstructure and electric properties of new
                               Mn-doped perovskites without degrading the advantages of high Curie temperatures.
                               The results verified that the Mn addition not only had a negative impact on the Curie
                               temperature of the material,.
                                    There are two shortcomings with respect to the bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric
                               materials: the high coercive field, which does not facilitate polarization, and the undesired
                               piezoelectric properties. To overcome the above drawbacks, procedure modifications and
                               doping modifications are employed. Doping modifications can improve the piezoelectric
                               properties of bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric materials, but at the cost of decreasing
                               their Curie temperature.

                               4.1.5. Can the High-Temperature Piezoelectric Nanocomposites Operate above
                               Curie Temperature?
                                    Generally, the piezoelectric materials work below Curie temperature. Can the high-
                               temperature piezoelectric nanocomposites operate above Curie temperature? Experimental
                               results from Mbarki et al. [43] offered the answer. They applied continuum modeling to
                               quantitatively analyze the possibility of achieving apparent piezoelectric materials with
                               large and temperature-stable electromechanical coupling in a wide temperature range that
                               extended remarkably above the Curie temperature. The barium and strontium titanate
                               was selected as the experimental materials, and the result showed the possibility for high-

                               coupling, and showed temperature stability up to 900 ◦ C.

                               4.2. Conductivity
                               4.2.1. The Importance of Conductivity
                                     As aforementioned in Section 3.2, high resistivity and high RC time constants are
                               basic requirements for a high-temperature sensor. On the one hand, a higher RC time
                               constant suggests a longer retention time for the charges to stay in the sensor, facilitating
                               their detection. On the other hand, the RC time constant also influences the minimum
                               effective frequency. The lower frequency of a sensor can be expressed as Equation (2).
                                     Furthermore, high conductivity has a negative effect on the pole of the piezoelectric
                               ceramics, while a too low conductivity may degrade the sensitivity of the device for its appli-
                               cation to sensors. Therefore, the conductivity is needed to mediate. However, although the
                               piezoelectric materials operated in evaluated temperature can maintain high-temperature
                               stability, their conductivity and deteriorating sensitivity may degrade. For example, with
                               respect to a sensor based on the AlGaN/GaN transistor, the resistance of the channel of the
                               transistor depends strongly on the relative change in pressure and temperature, due to the
                               mobility and carrier concentrations having a function relationship with the temperature. As
                               a result, measurements in high-temperature and high-pressure conditions become impracti-
                               cal [44–46]. The inappropriate resistivity also brings about undesirable issues (e.g., leakage
                               currents). For example, due to the volatility of Bi3+ of BF–BT, the valence change occurs
                               in Fe3+ (Fe3+ to Fe2+ ) and produces oxygen vacancy, leading to a large undesired leakage
                               current at room temperature and difficulties with polarization. This may be responsible
                               for the rare reporting on this material. Although some high-temperature piezoelectric
                               materials possess unexceptional Curie temperatures (1170 ◦ C), piezoelectric coefficients
                               and electromechanical coupling coefficients, the resistivity of the materials is relatively low
                               at high temperatures, and it can only be used in temperatures below 600 ◦ C.

                               4.2.2. The Approach to Adjust Conductivity
                               (a)   Suitable dopant substitution
                                    To tailor the conductivity, a suitable dopant substitution is recognized as a general but
                               important approach. However, it needs to be ingeniously designed to obtain piezoelectric
                               ceramics with high conductivity merely by combining the ion doping substitution with a
                               typical sintering procedure. For example, in 2009, Yan et al. [47] prepared Nd2 Ti2 O7 with a
                               high density (>98%) and high degree of orientation (~0.82) by suitable dopant substitution
                               to raise the d33 to 2.6 pC/N.
                               (b)   Co-doping
                                     With respect to a high-temperature piezoelectric compound based on oxide, the con-
                               ductivity strongly depends on the oxygen vacancy concentration. Therefore, the conductiv-
                               ity alteration also can be completed by adjusting the oxygen vacancy concentration. For
                               example, with respect to Bi4 Ti3 O12 (BIT)-based piezoelectric material, during the sintering
                               process, high oxygen vacancy concentrations generated by the volatilization of the bismuth
                               element pose the great challenge for its practical application. Fortunately, co-doping can
                               alleviate this problem. In Li’s work [48], the conductivity of the BIT ceramic was modulated
                               by tailoring the oxygen vacancy concentration using Cu and Sb co-doping. The experimen-
                               tal results showed that co-doping drastically reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration
                               and enhanced electrical resistivity, as well as improved the piezoelectric properties.
                               (c)   Adding the second unit
                                    Besides suitable dopant substitution and co-doping, alternatively, adding the second
                               unit is also an important avenue to improve dielectric properties. For one, the process of
                               forming a solid solution of multiple compounds can reduce the free energy and facilitate
                               the sintering process. For another, with the variation of the content of the second unit, the
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                           11 of 32




                               phase structure also changes, giving rises to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) or
                               polymorphic phase transition [49]. By incorporating the perovskite NaNbO3 into Ca2 Nb2 O7
                               and Sr2 Nb2 O7 , Titov et al. designed a novel ferroelectric niobate by means of the evolution
                               of the fractal crystal structure [50].
                                    Employing the ultrahigh-temperature piezoelectric material, CaBi2 Nb2 O9 with the
                               highest Curie temperature Tc, Long C. B. et al. reported [51] that electrical resistivity of
                               CaBi2 Nb2 O9 ceramics could be remarkably enhanced by BiMn co-substitution at the A and
                               B positions.
                               (d)   By modifying dielectric constant
                                     The dielectric constant has had a great influence on the conductivity of piezoelectric
                               materials, and further, a great impact on the piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric materi-
                               als. Some reports discovered that domain wall motion has untrivial effects on the dielectric
                               constant, giving rise to changing conductivity for piezoelectric materials. The 90◦ domain
                               wall motion has made a tremendous contribution to the dielectric constant of piezoelectric
                               materials. Arlt et al. [52] had put forward a model that elucidated these contributions phe-
                               nomenologically to separate the instinct effects from the domain wall’s motion contribution.
                               By means of this model, they discussed variations in the observations of piezoelectric at
                               low and high temperatures and at mediate and high frequencies that contributed to the
                               90◦ domain wall’s motion contribution.
                                     In another instance, Li et al. [53] have found that the quenching process had a positive
                               impact on the dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of 0.71 BiFeO3–0.29 BaTiO3
                               ceramics with Mn modification (BF–BT xmol% Mn). Yang et al. prepared [54] a high-temperature
                               piezoelectric ceramic of MnO2-doped 0.69 BiFeO3–0.02 Bi(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3–0.29BaTiO3
                               (BF69–BMT2–BT29) by combining the strategies of refined electroceramic processing and Mn-
                               doping, and adding a third BMT member to decrease the dielectric-loss of the optimized material.


                               4.3. Thermal Stability
                                     Thermal stability is the factor that is of the greatest significance for piezoelectric
                               materials operating at high temperatures. One of the methods to improve the thermal
                               stability of the materials is atom substitution. For instance, Pardo et al. [55] prepared
                               a sodium-substituted lithium niobate and systematically investigated the piezoelectric,
                               elastic and dielectric coefficients by impedance measurements at various temperatures.
                               Unexpectedly, the Na content had considerably increased the thermal stability of the mate-
                               rial, endowing it with piezoelectricity even at temperatures above 600 ◦ C. This suggested
                               that foreign atom substitution provided a powerful approach for improving the thermal
                               stability of piezoelectric materials. For another example, with respect to the crystal CTGS,
                               Ca3 NbGa3 Si2 O14 (GNGS) Sr3 TaGa3 Si2 O14 (STGS) Sr3 NbGa3 Si2 O14 (STGS), when it turned
                               out to be in a disordered state at high temperatures, the diffusion of oxygen vacancies
                               caused evaluations of its thermal conductivity and increased the loss of the crystal, which
                               deteriorated its performance at high temperatures. The disordered crystals possess a rel-
                               atively higher resistivity and comparatively more stable electromechanical properties at
                               high temperatures, as well as the Q-factor. Taking the cost, the evaluated resistivity and the
                               Q-factor into consideration, and for the purpose of decreasing the excess Ca2+ ions, Ca2+ is
                               replaced by Al3+ . As a result, the doped optimized crystal is obtained [56].

                               4.4. Chemical Stability
                                    Chemical stability is of great significance for piezoelectric materials operated at high
                               temperatures. Some high-temperature piezoelectric materials (e.g., perovskites) are vul-
                               nerable to organic solvents. For long-term use, the chemical stability of high-temperature
                               piezoelectric materials is essential. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop mediated and
                               chemically-stable high-temperature piezoelectric materials. For instance, by using the slow
                               evaporation solution growth technique, Murugan et al. have fabricated [57] piezoelectric
                               materials with l-Arginine 4-nitrophenolate 4-nitrophenol dihydrate single crystals pos-
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                             12 of 32




                               sessing both good chemical stability and fine piezoelectric coefficients, by means of slow
                               evaporation technology. The chemical stability could be ascribed to the fact that the phase
                               of the crystal quality was nearly perfect in absence of structural grain boundaries.

                               4.5. The Synergy of the Factors
                                    The synergy of the above factors is also of great significance and is expected to
                               be given high priority. It is unwired for pursuing high Tc at the cost of degrading the
                               chemical stability. Zheng et al. have studied [58] the synergistic relationships among the
                               Curie temperature of piezoelectricity and the stability of potassium–sodium niobhrate
                               piezoelectric ceramics. To solve the problem of improving to a large piezoelectricity (d33 ),
                               a high Curie temperature (TC ) and improved temperature stability synergistically for
                               (K,Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based ceramics, they modified the chemical composition to tailor
                               both d33 and TC to alter the phase boundaries. The optimized relationships among the
                               composition, phase boundary and electrical properties achieved the synergy and improved
                               these parameters for this high-temperature piezoelectric material. Therefore, this work
                               sheds light on the comprehensive acquaintances of KNN-based ceramics with a high TC .
                                    Taking different properties into comprehensive consideration, special process methods
                               are also utilized. Dan Yu et al. [59] presented a novel method for thermal gradient sintering
                               to fabricate the high-temperature piezoelectric crystals Bi12 TiO20 -BaTiO3 , and realized
                               improvements for both the piezoelectricity and Curie temperature.

                               5. The High-Temperature Piezoelectric Materials
                                    The continuous development of senor devices, actuators and other precise instruments
                               for high-temperature operations poses new challenge for the development of piezoelectric
                               materials for the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as others [21,60].
                                    The generally used piezoelectric materials for high temperatures are non-ferroelectrics
                               (including quartz and compounds related to the quartz structure and rare-earth oxyborates);
                               layer-structured and Aurivillius compounds; the perovskite BiFeO3 and its solid solution
                               binaries with PbTiO3 , BaTiO3 and (K0.5 Bi0.5 ) TiO3+ ; and other ternaries (e.g., all the above).

                               5.1. The Basis of High-Temperature Piezoelectric Materials
                               5.1.1. Non-Ferroelectrics
                               (a)   Quartz and compounds related to the quartz structure
                                    The quartz crystal, as one of the most primitive piezoelectric materials, has being
                               extensively utilized owing to its unparalleled stability. The quartz crystal [31,61,62] is a
                               kind of double-crystal and experiences α-β phase transition. The unwanted transition
                               may severely deteriorate the overall properties of the crystal. Consequently, the temper-
                               ature range is considerably altered. The natural mineral tourmaline possesses higher
                               resistivity, but the components of the material are extremely complex, such as (Ca,K,Na)
                               (Al,Fe,Li,Mg,Mn)3 (Al,Cr,Fe,V)6 (BO3 )3 (Si,Al,B)6 O18 (OH,F)4 , and impractically obtained
                               by synthesis [63]. The piezoelectric ceramics based on quartz crystals possess a layered
                               structure with a piezoelectric coefficient approaching 14 pC/N. However, it shows a heavy
                               dependency on the Tc of the materials, limiting its operating temperature to below 800 ◦ C.
                               The quartz has several disadvantages, such as a relatively lower piezoelectric coefficient
                               (2.31 pm/V), a low phase transition temperature (573 ◦ C) between phases, and mechanical
                               twinning at 300 ◦ C [64].
                               (b)   Rare-earth oxyborates
                                    The high-temperature piezoelectric materials based on rare-earth oxyborates have
                               been rarely reported, because the rare-earth elements are uncommon.
                                    With the development of electronics and sensing technologies, it is imperative for
                               scientists to exploit other materials beyond the above materials. Rare-earth oxyborates
                               have caught researchers’ interest, such as the structural disordered style La3 Ga5 SiO14 (LGS),
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                            13 of 32




                               La3 Ga5.5 Ta0.5 O14 (LGT),La3 Ga5.5 Nb0.5 O14 (LGN) and the structural ordered style
                               Ca3 NbGa3 Si2 O14 (CNGS) Ca3 TaGa3 Si2 O14 (CTGS),Sr3 TaGa3 Si2 O14 (STGS).
                                     The high-temperature piezoelectric crystal LGS possesses outstanding properties: high
                               resistivity, low dielectric loss and an electromechanical coupling coefficient about 2–3 times
                               higher than that of the quartz crystal.
                                     To promote the properties of this kind of high-temperature piezoelectric crystal, atomic
                               substitution is a general and effective method. For example, Jung et al. prepared the high-
                               temperature piezoelectric crystal La3 Ta0.5 Ga5.5 O14 (LTG) with Ga substituted by Al3+ [65].
                               During growth, the substituted Al3+ ion altered the distribution coefficient of the modified
                               products with congruent melting in a wide range without destabilizing the melt. The LTGA
                               crystals had dramatically promoted the temperature stability of its piezoelectric properties
                               in the range from R.T (room temperature) to 500 ◦ C, indicating its prospects for being
                               integrated in high-temperature applications.

                               5.1.2. Layer-Structured and Aurivillius Compounds (e.g., Bi4 Ti3 O12 and Related Materials)
                                    The bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) or Aurivillius-type piezoceramics,
                               with their exceptionally high Curie temperature (Tc) (about 600–900 ◦ C), are the candidates
                               for applications at required temperatures above 400 ◦ C.
                               (a)   Layer-structured (PLS) piezoelectric ceramics
                                    The perovskite layer-structured (PLS) piezoelectric materials have been studied since
                               the 1950s. In 1952, Cook and Jaffe [66] found a piezoelectric ceramic with a A2 B2 O7 pyro-
                               clastic texture that possessed ferroelectricity. In 1955, Jona et al. found Cd2 Nb2 O7 with a
                               crystalline structure of A2 B2 O7 [67]. However, not all Cd2 Nb2 O7 possess ferroelectricity.
                               In 1958, Rowland [68] discovered that Cd2 Nb2 O7 with a cleavage plane and oxygen octa-
                               hedral frame have no ferroelectricity. Generally, the PLS piezoelectric ceramics have the
                               structure formula of An Bn O3n+2 . The PLS piezoelectric ceramics were stacked by distorted
                               perovskite-type structure layers that are constituted of an oxygen octahedron with apical
                               oxygen atoms BO6 and 12 coordination cations. Specifically, n denotes the number of
                               oxygen octahedrons in the perovskite structure layer. As n = 4, the formula can be simpli-
                               fied as a A2 B2 O7 -style structure. As n = ∞, the formula can be simplified as a ABO3 -style
                               structure [69].
                                    The perovskite layer-structured (PLS) piezoelectric ceramics mainly contain three
                               kinds of structural styles: the cleavage plane is an orthogonal structure of [010], the cleavage
                               plane is a monoclinal structure of [100], and the surface of the solution is a monoclinic
                               structure of [001] [70].
                                    Taking an orthogonal structure of [010] of Sr2 Nb2 O7 as an example, the ferroelectric
                               phase at low temperatures is the orthogonal structure with the space group of Cmc21.
                               Figure 2a illustrates [71] the crystal structure diagram of the shadow, with the directions
                               cast along the a and c axes, respectively, where axis a is the direction of the oxygen octa-
                               hedral chain. Meanwhile, the layered distortion of the titanium core can be understood
                               as an octahedron configuration of NbO6 with rotations of its small angle, where axis b
                               is perpendicular to the direction of the perovskite layer, and axis c is situated along the
                               polarization direction. The additional SR–O layers are added between the layers, along
                               the direction of a. The additional SR–O is sandwiched between the above two layers and
                               the surface of the solution is a monoclinic structure with the crystalline direction of [010].
                               The ABO3 with a perovskite structure is generally driven by Bi ions (such as BaTiO3 ). The B
                               position is composed of the transition metallic elements with a vacant d orbital. Because
                               the d0 orbital is susceptible to a hybrid of the 2P orbital with oxygen and the oxygen atoms
                               in the B position may migrate, as a result, the spontaneous polarization occurred [72,73]. In
                               addition, there are small amounts of ferroelectric that were driven by ions in the B position.
                               For example, in BiFeO3 , Bi has lone pair electrons and is susceptible to hydrating with
                               other orbitals, which may lead to the atoms deviating and the spontaneous polarization
                               phenomenon. From the viewpoint of the crystal structure, although both the perovskite
                               structure and perovskite layer-structured merely contain the oxygen octahedron, the mech-

                                   from oxygen, while the Ti4+ in the B position had no contribution to the displacement
                                   of the atom. As shown in Figure 2b, the arrow represents the electric dipole moments
                                   generated by the displacement of the oxygen atom. Figure 2b shows the structure of the

                                   dipole moment generated by the displacement of the oxygen atom is not zero and exhibits
                                   a macroscopic polarization. By contract, with respect to the perovskite structure, the total

                               dipole moment had no contribution to the polarization rate, which can be explained by the
                               fact that the continuous octahedron of oxygen causes its neutralization.
                                     Bruyer et al. studied [75] the electronic structure and ferroelectricity of La2 Ti2 O7 and
                               Nd2 Ti2 O7 , and the results indicated that their spontaneous polarizations were 7.72 µC/cm2
                               and 7.42 µC/cm2 . Figure 2c display the electronic density of the state distribution of
                               La2 Ti2 O7 . It clearly can be detected that the bond between Ti and O was not a sin-
                               gle ion-bonding, and that the stronger covalent bonding also exists. The hydration of
                               the ferroelectricity phase enhances in orbitals of Ti4d and O2p , which lead to the an-
                               isotropicity of electronic density of the state. Sakharov et al. [76] have systematically
                               investigated dielectric constants, piezoelectric coefficients, and thermal expansion factors of
                               PLS piezoelectric ceramics, and found that these parameters were temperature-dependent.
                               Kugaenko et al. [77] also studied thermophysical parameters of langasite (La3 Ga5 SiO14 ),
                               langatate (La3 Ta0.5 Ga5.5 O14 ) and catangasite (Ca3 TaGa3 Si2 O14 ) single crystals in a tempera-
                               ture range of 25 to 1000 ◦ C. They found that at elevated temperatures, the heat conductivity
                               anisotropy parameters decreased, and higher χ and λ values were associated with closely
                               packed directions in the crystal.
                                     The typical methods for fabricating PLS piezoelectric materials are solid reaction
                               synthesis, molten salt synthesis and the method of sol-gel [78,79]. The sintering of PLS
                               piezoelectric powders mainly involves solid state reaction (SSR), spark plasma sintering
                               (SPS), hot forging (HF) and so on.
                               (b)   Aurivillius compounds (e.g., Bi4 Ti3 O12 and related materials)
                                     Bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric (BLSFs) is also named the Aurivillius phase
                               compound, which has an unparalleled Curie temperature, a low dielectric constant, an
                               obvious electromechanical coupling coefficient, a low aging rate and a high resistivity [32].
                               These merits provide the access to sensor applications for Aurivillius phase ceramics, and
                               they are applied in extreme environments or for nonvolatile ferroelectric random-access
                               memory [80]. The structure can be expressed as (Bi2 O2 )2+ (Am−1 Bm O3m+1 )2− . A represents
                               one valence, di-valence, tri-valence or their combination, constructing the dodecahedron
                               coordination. B represents a transition metallic ion that constructs the octahedron coordi-
                               nation, and m represents the number of layers in the perovskite (the value can be selected
                               from 1 to 6) [81]. The common compounds of bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics
                               (BLSFs) are CaBi2 Nb2 O9 (CBN) [82], SrBI2 Ta2 O9 (SBT) [83], Na0.5 Bi2.5 Nb2 O9 (CN) [84] and
                               Nd2 Ti2 O7 [85]. m = 3 Bi4 Ti3 O12 (BIT) [86] and m = 4 CaBi4 Ti4 O15 (CBT) [87]. However, due
                               to its particular 2D structure, the spontaneous polarization is limited in the a-b plane [88],
                               which degrades the properties of the bismuth layer-structured piezoelectric crystals: in-
                               creasing the coercive field causes decreases in the piezeoelectric coefficient, and makes it
                               difficult to obtain a perfect structure by polarization. CaBi4 Nb2 O9 is a kind of typical bis-
                               muth layer-structured ferroelectric ceramic consisting of (Bi2 O2 )2+ (Cam-1 Nbm O7 )2− (m = 2).
                               The Curie temperature of CBN is drastically high (940 ◦ C), ranking the CBN one of the
                               best high-temperature piezeoelectric materials. It possesses a relative lower piezeoelectric
                               coefficient, with a value of only 5 pC/N, restricting its application in high-temperature
                               areas. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the piezeoelectric properties of bismuth
                               layer-structured ferroelectric materials.
                                     In single crystals, the direction of the spontaneous polarization is determined by the
                               magnitude of the spontaneous polarization. In piezoelectric materials, the direction is deter-
                               mined by the ferroelectric domain state and the maximum magnitude of the spontaneous
                               polarization. In Bi4 Ti3 O12 , the maximum magnitudes of the spontaneous polarization
                               of crystal systems along the orthorhombic [100] and [001] direction are 4 µC/cm2 and
                               50 µC/cm2 [89], respectively. The vector of the spontaneous polarization is 50 µC/cm2 .
                               In orthorhombic crystals, [100] is tilted to [001] by 4.5◦ . Every component can be cal-
                               culated by truing the atom [90], the crystal constant and the charge number of the ion.
                               The result is that the crystalline direction [100] titled to [001] by 6.3◦ is extracted by every
                               polarization component.

                                     The aforementioned Aurivillius-type piezoceramics and bismuth layer-structured
                               ferroelectrics (BLSFs) might be the only available materials which can be operated above
                               600 ◦ C, taking advantage of their ultrahigh Curie temperature. Apart from their unparal-
                               leled high-temperature properties, Aurivillius-type materials are displacement-type ferro-
                               electrics. The spontaneous polarization of bismuth layer-structured compound materials
                               can be ascribed to three aspects: (1) the displacement of the center ion in the octahedronin,
                               (2) the tilting of the octahedronin along the c-axis and (3) the rotation of the octahedronin in
                               the a-b plane. With respect to bismuth layer-structured compound materials, when m = 2n
                               and m = 2n + 1, their spontaneous polarizations are different. When m = 2n, the spontaneous
                               polarization is along the a axis, and when m = 2n + 1, the spontaneous polarization is also
                               along the a axis; weak spontaneous polarization also exists along the c axis [91].
                                     The spontaneous polarization of bismuth layer-structured compound materials is
                               not the same as a simple perovskite. Newnham et al. assumed in their work that the
                               spontaneous polarization of bismuth layer-structured compound materials originates from
                               the movement of the Ti4+ at the Bi position of the octahedronin to edge of the perovskite [92].
                               Recently, the spontaneous polarization of bismuth layer-structured compound materials
                               can be explained by the fact that the oxygen octahedronin moves along the axis with respect
                               to the Bi ion at the a position. The movement can be attributed to the fact that the Bi ion at
                               the a position is an unsaturated bond in the primary structure.
                                     The Aurivillius -type piezoceramics also possess the advantages of cost-effectiveness
                               and non-toxicity. Previous studies indicated that most bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric
                               materials possess a 180◦ domain. However, recently, it was verified that bismuth layer-
                               structured ferroelectric materials have a 180◦ domain, 90◦ domain, reverse-phase domain,
                               180◦ reverse-phase domain and 90◦ reverse-phase domain, which were generated by the
                               vanishing of the translation symmetry [93–95]. Though, according to space group theory,
                               bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric materials may possess the reverse-phase domain
                               boundary, which does not exist in Bi4 Ti3 O12 . Due to the absence of the reverse-phase
                               domain boundary in the BIT, it is assumed that the interfacial energy of the reverse-phase
                               domain boundary is too high in BIT, causing an unstable interface. Due to the fact that the
                               radius of La2+ is bigger than Bi2+ and the replacement of La2+ for Bi2+ may reduce crystal
                               distortions, the interfacial energy of the reverse-phase domain boundary reduces further.
                               As a consequence, the reverse-phase domain boundary takes place.

                               5.1.3. Perovskites
                               (a)   Universal perovskites materials
                                    Owing to their particular electrical and optical properties, perovskites (HPs) have been
                               “hot spots” with extensive attention paid to it both academically and practically over the
                               past decade. They possess promising prospects in applications for piezoelectric nanowire
                               materials, solar cells and memory devices [96–98].
                                    The general formula for perovskites is ABO3 . The structure of perovskites can be signi-
                               fied as a simple cubic lattice. Every lattice point represents one structural unit. The vertex
                               angle is occupied by a bigger A ion, the center of the lattice is occupied by a smaller B ion
                               and the six oxygen ion takes position in the center of the area. These oxygen ions formed an
                               oxygen octahedron, with the center and gap being taken up by the B and A ions separately.
                               The oxygen octahedron has three fourfold axes, four threefold axes and six bifold axes.
                               The main spontaneous polarization is derived from the movement of the B ion deviating
                               from the center of the octahedron.
                                    In an ABO3 -type configuration, every ion is distributed in a square model. The main
                               structures of perovskite strongly depend on the tolerance factor parameters (as aforemen-
                               tioned in Section 4.1.2).
                                                                              r + r0
                                                                      t= √ A                                              (5)
                                                                             2(r B + r0 )
                                    t is referred to as the tolerance factor. Generally, t is in a range of 0.77~0.99. To keep the
                               stability of the perovskite’s structure, the distance of the ions changed with coordination

                               numbers, with t in a range of 0.77~0.99. For example, in SrTiO3 , t = 1. With respect to the
                               perovskite, when t = 0.86 and while in the six-party phase, t > 1. The tolerance factor plays
                               an important role for preparing the solid solution. With respect to the high-temperature
                               piezoelectric materials based on perovskites, the characteristics of the electrical domain
                               play an essential role in the performance properties.
                                    In regards to the Pb(Mg1/2 Nb2/3 )O3 -PbTiO3 , the XRD characterization reveals that
                               the 90◦ domain has essential effects on the variation of the intensity of the peck, and
                               the 180◦ domain has no effect on it. Fancher et al. [99] proposed that the XRD pecks of
                               quasi-cubic structures changed from single peaks to double peaks, ascribed to the crystal’
                               distortions and the rearrangement of the ferroelasticity. With increases in the polarization
                               electrical field, the crystal distortion expanded and the bifurcate became more obvious.
                               Damjanovic et al. [100] studied a single crystal of the PMN-xPT and PN-xPT by in situ
                               measurement. The DC electrical field could induce first-order phase transformation. With
                               increasing PT content, the process of phase transformation is R/MA-T, MA-Mc-T and
                               Mc-T, with large quantities of the 180◦ domain and the 90◦ domain co-existing in the
                               piezoelectric ceramic. The 90◦ domain swerve may change the inner stress and induce
                               phase transformation.
                                    The piezoelectricity performance of perovskite piezoelectric materials depends on
                               the composition, crystal structure, grain boundary and electrical domain, as well as the
                               microstructure. Pronin et al. investigated the relationships between the features of the
                               microstructure and the piezoelectric performance of perovskite piezoelectric materials,
                               using perovskite islands in a pyrochlore phase matrix of lead zirconate titanate thin films.
                               The experimental results discovered the effect of the radial inhomogeneity of the surface
                               morphology on the piezo-response of the islands [101]. Doping also can be served an effect
                               method to increase stability. The Pb(Mg1/3 Nb2/3 )O3 (t = 0.89) Pb(Zn1/3 Nb2/3 )O3 (t = 0.986)
                               can be improved in its stability by replacement of Ba2+ with Pb2+ [36].
                               (b)   Perovskite materials based on lead-free compounds
                                    Though the perovskite piezoelectric materials based on lead salts show ultrahigh
                               piezoelectric responses, the toxicity issue poses severe challenges for their broad application.
                               Therefore, it is urgent to exploit for lead-free piezoelectric materials [35,102–107].
                                    With respect to the mechanism of lead-free perovskite piezoelectric materials, no
                               unanimous consensus has been arrived at. Among the myriad of high-temperature piezo-
                               electric materials, KNN can also be recognized as a star material. Ka0.5 Na0.5 NbO3 [108]
                               is composed of anti-ferroelectrics (NaNbO3 ) and ferroelectrics (KaNbO3 ). The KNN ce-
                               ramic also possesses a high Tc and high kp . Until now, the KNN ceramic is one of the
                               high-temperature piezoelectric materials that simultaneously possess comparatively good
                               piezoelectric properties and Curie temperatures. However, the drawbacks regarding the
                               polymorphic phase transition and unfeasible processing procedures have significantly
                               restricted its development as a lead-free high-temperature piezoelectric material.

                               5.2. The Hybrid High-Temperature Piezoelectric Materials
                                     It is widely acknowledged that to boost the piezoelectric performance of pure piezoelec-
                               tric materials, incorporating other components to construct hybrid systems demonstrates
                               a powerful approach to make up for the shortcomings of each component and to exploit
                               synergy effects [109–114]. Baur et al. [109] enhanced the piezoelectric performance of PVDF
                               with carbon fluoropolymer nanocomposites. This is also the case with high-temperature
                               piezoelectric materials, though reports on hybrid high-temperature piezoelectric materials
                               are really rare. The incorporation of foreign components may effectively elevate the intrin-
                               sic temperature of the materials and even render the piezoelectric materials pristine, and
                               when applied in R. T., it can be used at high temperatures. As an example, Yang et al. [115]
                               designed a flexible PVDF-based nanocomposite, with the added components considerably
                               promoting the inherent usage temperature of the PVDF, showing a stable piezoelectricity
                               covering a wide temperature range from 10 to 100 ◦ C. The advanced performance is mainly
                               attributed to the strong multi-interface effect. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric coefficient d33
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                               18 of 32




                               reached a peak of 40 pC/N and showed excellent retention with increasing temperatures
                               up to 100 ◦ C.
                                    Jian et al. [116] developed a method for synthesizing PbTiO3 with a 3D multilevel
                               flower-like structure (PTFs) and polyimide (PI)/PTFs composites to prepare piezoelectric
                               generators (PENGs) with outstanding energy harvesting performances at high temper-
                               atures. The PENGs made from the PI/PTFs composite showed excellent output perfor-
                               mances of ISC ~ 103 µA, V OC ~ 140 V and P ~ 2128 µW. Particularly, higher degrees of
                               electric power can be continuously generated by the PENG at a wide range of tempera-
                               tures, from room temperature to 300 ◦ C. Excellent durability up to 5000 cycles can also be
                               achieved for the PENG within the temperature range.
                                    As aforementioned in Section 4.1.3, Guo et al. [40] fabricated high-temperature piezo-
                               electric materials of BiFeO3 –BaTiO3 –NdCoO3 with multiferroic characteristics, and un-
                               covered that the introduction of NdCoO3 into BiFeO3 –BaTiO3 considerably promoted its
                               piezoelectricity and multiferroicity, and the magnetoelectric effect of the materials.
                                    As aforementioned in Section 4.2.2, via incorporating the content of the second unit
                               to form hybrid nanocomposites, phase structures also change, giving rise to the mor-
                               photropic phase boundary (MPB) or polymorphic phase transition [49]. Chen et al. pre-
                               pared the piezoelectric ceramics (1–x) Sr2 Nb2 O7 (Na0.5 Bi0.5 )TiO3 (x = 0~0.05) through the
                               traditional sintering method by incorporating perovskite Na0.5 Bi0.5 TiO3 into the Sr2 Nb2 O7.
                               The incorporation of Na0.5 Bi0.5 TiO3 had remarkably improved the properties of Sr2 Nb2 O7 .
                               The obtained non-textured piezoelectric ceramics based on Sr2 Nb2 O7 had excellent piezo-
                               electric performance with d33 : ~1.0 pC/N and good thermal stability. The de-polarization
                               temperature was above 1200 ◦ C [117].
                                    The newly merged 2D materials have injected fresh blood into the family of high-
                               temperature piezoelectrics materials. Mohanta et al. have [118] explored a novel high-
                               temperature piezoelectric material based on the 2D material BP-gallium nitride, and con-
                               stituted a stable 2D van der Waals heterojunction. The remarkably high piezoelectric
                               coefficient was (d33max ≈ 40 pm V−1 ), which originated from the large difference in atomic
                               charges between the GaN and BP monolayers and the out-of-plane inversion asymmetry,
                               This value was comparatively higher than the out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of the
                               multilayered Janus transition metal dichalcogenide MXY (d33max = 10.57 pm V−1 ) in the
                               previous work. This state-of-the-art BP/GaN hetero-bilayer could open new opportunities
                               for next-generation devices.

                               6. The Design of the High-Temperature Piezoelectric Materials
                               6.1. How Do the Materials in Section 5 Meet the Limiting Factors Identified in Section 4?
                                    The typical high-temperature piezoelectric materials are introduced above. Practically,
                               according to their own characteristics, the targets and the anticipated effects of the projected
                               properties of the materials are expected to be taken into comprehensive consideration.
                               (a)   The investigation of phase characteristics
                                    The phase characteristics can be recognized as one of the decisive factors on the
                               utmost properties of high-temperature piezoelectric materials. Due to the narrow window
                               for preparing BiFeO3 , the products may be mixed up with a second phase. During the
                               mixing procedure, Fe3+ is susceptible to transiting to Fe2+ and giving rise to the BiFeO3 ,
                               accompanied by the production of a large quantity of oxygen vacancies. As a consequence,
                               the saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loop is undetected. To improve the properties of
                               BiFeO3 , element doping is applied (e.g., La [119], Tb [120], Mn [121], Ti [122], Dy [123]). To
                               obtain a stable perovskite structure, it is reasonable to construct a solid solution system with
                               another ABO3 -style ferroelectric (e.g., BiFeO3 , PbTiO3 , PbZrO3 , Pb(Fe0.5 Nb0.5 )O3 [124]).
                               The incorporation of BiFeO3 into the perovskite structure-based piezoelectric materials can
                               be stabilized and limited in its foreign phase, with its resistivity improved as well [125].
                                    The piezoelectric materials with an Aurivilius-type structure also experience phase
                               transition. Steiner et al. have [126] investigated the piezoelectric performance of bismuth
Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                             19 of 32




                               titanate niobate Bi7 Ti4 NbO21 , which was closely related to the Bi3 TiNbO9 clusters during
                               the phase transition process.
                               (b)   The polarization
                                    The polarization powders technology is utilized to analyze the crystal structure and
                               dielectric coefficient of the tetragonal phase that is located far from the composition points,
                               as well as the tetragonal phase and monoclinic phases that are located near the composition
                               points. Moreover, this technology is employed for truing the MPB and the rhombic phase
                               before polarization and after polarization [127]. Through this technology, it can be observed
                               that the rhombic phase after being polarized virtually contains two structures, Cm and
                               P4mm, explained by the fact that the metastable structure of the second phase expanded
                               during the polarization process. It can also be detected that the dielectric coefficient
                               increased at the MPB composition points and near the MPB composition points after
                               being polarized. At the lower composition points, the dielectric coefficient after being
                               polarized is lower than it is before being polarized. The decrease in the dielectric coefficient
                               was attributed to its alignment along the orientation of the polarization. By contrast, the
                               increase in the dielectric coefficient was derived from the phase transition of ferroelectric
                               materials. In addition, with respect to the BNT relaxation ferroelectrics and PMN relaxation
                               ferroelectrics, it could be deduced that the polarization electrical field had effects on the
                               crystal structure to the same extent [128].
                               (c)   Structural modification and process optimization
                                     Currently, a great many scientists endeavor to improve the piezoelectric properties
                               by component optimization, phase structural engineering and process improvement. Par-
                               ticularly, the structural engineering is also important for promoting the piezoelectric per-
                               formance of piezoelectric materials for high-temperature applications. For instance, Wang
                               et al. have [129] presented a lithium niobate single crystal possessing the largest effective
                               piezoelectric and electromechanical coupling factors by an optimum crystal cut (XZt/28◦ ),
                               and indicated that the structural modifications have pronounced influence on the macro-
                               scopic electrical properties and, furthermore, lead to their high Curie temperature and
                               piezoelectric activity.
                                     The high-temperature piezoelectric ceramic Pb1-x(Yb1/2Nb1/2)0.515Ti0.485O3-x{(2SrO + BaO)/3}
                               [PYNT–Sbx ] can be altered by atomic Sb substitution at the rhombohedral side near
                               the morphotropic phase boundary to increase the tetragonality. The Sb-doped product
                               changed the function relationship between the temperature and the relative permittiv-
                               ity. The piezoelectric coefficient dramatically improved to 610 pm V−1 and the maximum
                               dielectric constant soared to 25,000 [130].
                               (d)   The investigation of doping
                                     In Section 4.1 of this review, we mentioned that the Curie temperature could be
                               evaluated by doping. Doping is a general method to increase the Curie temperature and the
                               high-temperature stability of high-temperature piezoelectric materials. The most widely
                               used dopants are salts. Scientists have also made efforts to gain deeper insights into the
                               underlying mechanisms of doping. Lin et al. have promoted the piezeoelectric coefficient
                               d33 from 93 pC/N to 208 pC/N by doping the Li and Ta elements [131]. Previous studies
                               reckoned that the improvement of the piezeoelectric properties was ascribed to the effect of
                               doping of the constructed MPB phase boundary (just like the boundary in PZT). However,
                               the strengthening mechanism of piezeoelectric ceramic of (K, Na)NbO3 was polymorphic
                               phase transition (PPT) rather than the typical MPB phase boundary. It is acknowledged
                               that the MPB possessed excellent thermal stability, which was closely associated with the
                               components of the piezeoelectric ceramic. By contrast, the PPT mechanism is strongly
                               temperature-dependent. That is, the promoting of piezeoelectric properties of (K, Na) NbO3
                               can be explained by the fact that the transformation from the orthogonality phase to the
                               tetragonal phase is controlled in room temperature rather than 200 ◦ C. Nevertheless, the
        Nanomaterials 2022, 12, 1171                                                                                              20 of 32




                                         PPT effect has a negative effect on the thermal stability and is harmful for the realization

                                         6.2. The Analysis of Performance
                                         (a)   The inherent structure (comparison of nonferroelectric piezoelectric crystals and
                                               ferroelectric crystals)
                                              The nonferroelectric piezoelectric crystals (e.g., quartz crystals, AlN crystals) also show
                                         high Curie temperatures, yet, their piezoelectric properties are unsatisfied. This can be
                                         ascribed to the absence of spontaneous polarization and ferroelectric-related electroporation
                                         within these crystals, which can be explained by the fact that the piezoelectricity of these
                                         crystals stems from the asymmetry of the crystal structure, not their ferroelectricity. On the
                                         contrary, ferroelectric materials can produce a larger piezoelectric response depending on
                                         the orientation or flip of the ferroelectric ceramics under the electric field, motivating many
                                         researchers to attempt to fabricate the single crystal of ferroelectric ceramics with a high
                                         Curie temperature [132].
                                         (b)   The relationship between Curie temperature and the tolerance factor
                                         In regards to some perovskite-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics, the
                                    relationship between the Curie temperature of the materials and the tolerance factor is
                                    almost linear. As shown in Figure 3, the smaller the tolerance factor, the higher the Curie
                                    temperature, with the Curie temperature of the material smallest as the tolerance factor
                                    moves closer to 1 [37]. Until now, there is no exact interpretation for the above relationship.
                                    According to the definition of the tolerance factor, when the crystal adopts the cubic
                                    phase (paraelectric phase), the tolerance factor becomes 1. The smaller the tolerance factor,
                                    the greater the structural distortion of the material with regard to the deviation of the

                                    crystal structure from the cubic phase, which is responsible for the increase in the Curie
                                    temperature with increasing structural distortions. This may explain why the smaller the
                                    tolerance factor, the higher the Curie temperature.

                                    Depolarization is an undesirable but important phenomenon which significantly
                               degrades piezoelectric materials. Unfortunately, there is no effective and accurate mea-
                               surement method to evaluate the degree of depolarization of piezoelectric materials.
                               An in situ quasi-static high-temperature Berlincourt test is introduced to measure the
                               piezoelectric constants and extract the relationships between the piezoelectric coef-
                               ficients and the temperature. This shed light on the studying of the depolarization

                               and piezoelectivity, the phase field technique [135] can serve as a powerful tool to determine
                               the optimal conditions experimentally. For example, this technique can give the most-

                               oxygen activity [137] on the microstructures and properties of BaTiO3 ceramics. Narita et al.
                               reported [138] a phase field simulation framework to study the effects of oxygen vacancy
                               densities and grain size on the poling of the pristine BaTiO3 polycrystals, as well as on the
                               piezoelectric coefficient and the permittivity of the poled BaTiO3 polycrystals. Additionally,
                               phase field simulation [139] also can be introduced to study the intrinsic relationships
                               between the grain size on the domain structures and the electromechanical properties of
                               ferroelectric polycrystals. Apart from phase field simulations, finite element analysis is also

                               plied in high-temperature piezoelectric valves for fuel injection. In order to improve
                               the combustion efficiency of diesel engines, multilayer pressure electrical actuators
                               have been widely used to replace solenoid valves, which can effectively improve fuel
                               combustion efficiency and reduce CO2 and NOx emissions. However, the temperature
                               of the injection chamber is over 150 ◦ C. After being used at this temperature for a long
                               time, traditional PZT piezoelectric ceramic materials will generate aging and degrading
                               problems. In the field of national defense, high-temperature multilayer piezoelectric
                               drivers directly control the valve-to-pulse width of the lateral bypass of tail nozzles.
                               Control of direct lateral forces is an important means for controlling missiles. Recently,
                               owing to its higher Curie temperature and higher piezoelectric coefficient d33 , the BS–
                               PT-based high-temperature piezoelectric ceramics have been expected to replace PZT
                               piezoelectric ceramics and overcome the existing problem of high-temperature aging.
                               The left panel of Figure 5a shows the multilayer piezoelectric drivers made of BS–PT

                                     Piezoelectric actuators convert mechanical energy (e.g., mechanical vibrations,

                               7.1.3. High-Temperature Acoustic Emission Sensor
                                     Acoustic emission sensors work in the broadband response frequency range. Though
                               ferroelectric material-based transmitting acoustic emission sensors are widely used, they
                               are limited by their material properties that are incompatible with applications at 500 ◦ C
                               and above. Johnson et al. used a non-iron piezoelectric acoustic emission sensor, fabricated
                               by YCOB single crystal material [142,143]. The structure of the device is shown in the top
                               panel of Figure 5c. The temperature ranges from room temperature to 1000 ◦ C, and the
                               setup device is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5c.

                               7.1.4. High-Temperature Piezoelectric Vibration Sensor
                                    The engine is the heart of the aerospace vehicle, and the real-time and dynamic
                               monitoring of the motion inside the engine is directly related to the aircraft. In order
                               to accurately test the motion state of various components in the engine under a high-
                               temperature environment, the sensor is expected to be placed directly on the engine’s
                               surface or blade at temperatures above 1000 ◦ C. Because of its stable piezoelectricity and
                               electromechanical coupling properties when performing at high-temperatures, the YCOB
                               crystal has received widespread attention. Kim et al. [144] designed and prepared a type
                               shear high-temperature accelerometer based on the YCOB crystal for temperatures above
                               1000 ◦ C. The structure of the vibration sensor at the above ambient temperature is shown
                               in the upper panel of Figure 5d, and the high-temperature environment test equipment is
                               shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5d.

                               7.1.5. The Acoustic Wave (SW) Devices and Surficial Acoustic Wave (SAW) Devices
                                    High-temperature piezoelectricity has promising prospects in acoustic wave (SW)
                               devices and surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Because of the low transmission
                               velocity of surface acoustic wave (SAW), the size of the device may decrease signifi-
                               cantly, which may greatly motivate the progress of a miniaturized device. Furthermore,
                               the composite material for acoustic wave (SW) devices requires the crystal to have
                               no phase transitions in the temperature range of 1300–1500 ◦ C. For example, ReCOB,
                               a hot-topic material for high-temperature applications, has no phase transition until
                               melting temperatures and possesses a high electromechanical coupling coefficient
                               and a high piezoelectric coefficient. Besides, it also possesses high electromechanical
                               temperature stability (at 1000 ◦ C the piezoelectric coefficient is almost unchanged) and
                               unprecedented resistivity. Particularly, the crystal is grown by the Czochralski method,
                               which is responsible for it being a high-quality large-area crystal, demonstrating its
                               potential for new-generation piezoelectrics for high-temperature applications. SAW
                               sensors can test the temperature by wireless transmission, and are placed inside the
                               engine. Aubert et al. [145] studied AlN/ sapphire and indium forked fingers and tested
                               the long-term working stability of the device. The structure of the electrode used at

                               a high temperature (1050 ◦ C) is shown in the upper panel of Figure 5e. As shown in
                               the bottom panel of Figure 5e, though, at 1050 ◦ C the AlN layer underwent severe
                               oxidation, but showed good stability below 1000 ◦ C.
                                    Kuznetsova et al. studied the temperature coefficient of delay for lowest-order plate
                               wave modes, S0 , A0 , and SH0 , in the LiNbO3 crystal. TCD is demonstrated to be a weak
                               function of the normalized plate thickness h/λ (h = plate thickness, λ = acoustic wavelength)
                               in almost all modes and in all orientations, except for the A0 mode in X-Z and the YZ plates.
                               The results showed that plate waves can provide higher K2 and lower TCD than is possible
                               with SAWs, which conforms well with theory [146].

                               7.1.6. The Frequency-Controlling Devices
                                    The frequency-controlling devices of some equipment for aeronautics and astronautics
                               or other precise instruments are generally operated at high temperatures, which puts
                               forward higher requirements for piezoelectric nanocomposites, and they inevitably play
                               essential roles in this area. For instance, Karaki et al. monitored the electric elastic constant
                               of CNGS crystals by the resonance method and measured the temperature coefficient
                               of the elastic constant, demonstrating its promising application for frequency-controlled
                               devices [147].

                               7.1.7. The Vibrating Beam Resonator
                                    Douchet designed a vibrating beam resonator with the crystals possessing a 32-point
                               group, and revealed that the crystals with length-stretching vibration mode possessed the
                               zero-frequency cut symbol [148].

                               7.1.8. The Sensors
                                    Fritze et al. systematically investigated the BAW resonator of LGS crystals in high
                               temperatures, and designed the LGS gas sensor on the basis of this [149].
                                    Tortissier et al. studied the sensor of LGS crystals employed in detecting chemical
                               components in harsh environments. They also evaluated the frequency variation of the
                               retardation line [150].
                                    Anisimkina et al. presented temperature sensor prototypes based on a surface acoustic
                               wave with high-sensitivity selectivity, which can be operated independently of the rest of
                               the physical parameters of liquids. The ultrahigh selectivity (0.03–0.005 ◦ C) is realized by
                               preventing physical contact between a tested sample and a surface acoustic wave. With
                               the aim of enhancing the sensitivity, they increase the wave path from a transmitter to a
                               receiver, accompanied by a fifth wave harmonic [151].
                                    Besides the above sensors, gas sensors are also important. During high-temperature
                               combustion, a piezoelectric gas sensor is adopted for closely monitoring ambient gas
                               and pressure. The microbalance working mode adsorbs and compresses gas molecules
                               through thin films. The resonant frequency of an electrical element varies with its
                               mass [152,153]. The upper panel of Figure 5f illustrates the work principle of the gas
                               sensor and the bottom panel of Figure 5f shows the monitoring result of the oxygen
                               content in a hydrogen/argon environment by an LGS gas sensor. It can be seen that
                               the device can achieve gas monitoring in a range from room temperature to 600 ◦ C.
                               Takeda et al. [154] presented a pressure sensor based on calcium aluminate silicate
                               (CAS) crystals and the performance test under dynamic stress loading.

                               7.1.9. The Optoelectronic Devices
                                     Besides the aforementioned applications, high-temperature piezoelectrics nanocom-
                               posites can also be adopted for structuring optoelectronic devices. It is worth mentioning
                               that the crystal structure of AgGaGeS4 –AgGaGe3 Se8 possesses the particular optoelectronic
                               characteristics, showing great promise for optoelectronic applications. For instance, Nag-
                               gar et al. [155] designed a novel and different laser-powered optoelectronic device based
                               on a chalcogenide semiconductor. The optoelectronic features of the high-temperature
                               piezoelectric materials originated from their intrinsic defects and the electron-phonon

                               anharmonicities within their crystal lattice. SEM and EPMA revealed that AgGaGeS4 and
                               AgGaGe3 Se8 single crystals possessed high-quality and homogenous characteristics. Par-
                               ticularly, the well-defined Ag-Ga-Ge-(S,Se) crystals and solid solutions had the advantages
                               of high birefringence and high non-linear optical efficiencies, demonstrating their great
                               prospects in coherent laser frequency conversion in the near-infrared spectral range.

                               7.2. Physical Properties for Practical Application
                                     The unsatisfying speed of development of high-temperature piezoelectric materi-
                               als has seriously impeded the use of piezoelectric devices in extremity environments.
                               The high-temperature applications not only propose advanced requirements for its mate-
                               rial properties (the half-Curie temperature point is supposed to be higher than the opera-
                               tional temperature, and the piezoelectric constants d33 ,d31 are required to be stable across
                               the whole temperature range, from room temperature to operation temperature), d33 also
                               requires a high thermal stability [156] at the operating temperature. Secondly, during the
                               process, it is supposed to avoid adhering to resin and other organic substances. In regard to
                               some special materials, it is supposed to guarantee that all materials in the whole structure
                               possess the ability for withstanding the test of a high-temperature environment [157,158].
                               For a transducer, the most important factors are the variation of its piezoelectric constants,
                               electromechanical coupling coefficients and dielectric constants with regard to temperature
                               and vibration. Specifically, as the temperature moves above 500 ◦ C, the requirements for
                               ultrasonic transducers are higher. Therefore, researchers resorted to the materials possess-
                               ing high Curie temperatures (YCOB, LN crystals) [143,159]. Thirdly, the thermal fatigue
                               performance is also required to lay emphasis on high-temperature environments, for the
                               depolarization effect is more severe when the temperature and vibration are imposed
                               simultaneously. The depolarization of the piezoelectric constant d31 is easier than d33 .
                                     For high-temperature sensors, temperature stability is required to be given the high-
                               est priority. It is urgent for high-temperature accelerometer materials to maintain high-
                               temperature stability, high resistivity, narrow bandwidth, low mechanical loss, and a high
                               electromechanical coupling coefficient [160]. The stability is required to be given priority
                               for the materials used in high-temperature devices (e.g., SAW) [145], while high resistivity,
                               the temperature expansion coefficient, the compliance coefficient and mechanical loss are
                               also required to receive emphasis. So, the high-temperature crystal YCOB has become the
                               most favored material [161,162] for these high-temperature sensors.

                               8. Concluding Remarks
                                    Due to the rapid progress that has been made in material science, electronics and en-
                               ergy science, high-temperature piezoelectrics will be given considerable attention to fulfill
                               the demands of crucial devices in aeroengines, nuclear reactors and so on. Great progress
                               has been made to improve the properties of piezoelectric materials that are applied in ele-
                               vated temperatures. Through systematically introducing the fundamental knowledge about
                               the piezoelectric mechanism, piezoelectronics and piezophotoelectronics, and describing
                               the classification, applications, parameters and typical instances of high-temperature piezo-
                               electric materials, this review offers relatively comprehensive information for scientists
                               or researchers to design and explore high-temperature piezoelectric materials. However,
                               there are still many challenges for the development of high-temperature piezoelectric ma-
                               terials. First, hitherto, there is rarely a principle that explains the relationships between
                               the microstructure and properties. Second, it is un-accessible to achieve the synergistic
                               interactions among the multiple factors with the optimum points. Third, it is imperative to
                               exploit the comprehensive properties combining ultrahigh de-polarization temperatures,
                               piezoelectricity, a low damping and an outstanding mechanical and flexibility for meeting
                               the new demands of the area of sophisticated equipment.
