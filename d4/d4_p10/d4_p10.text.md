                               Investigation of the dielectric properties of source rocks carried out in [16–18] showed
                         that the values of the relative permittivity of the source rock samples are an order of

                                 and the loss tangent along the bedding are 1.5–4 times higher than across it. This result can
                                 be useful in choosing the direction of the electromagnetic irradiation to influence oil source
                                 fields [16,17]. All these results are a good prerequisite for studies of heating source rocks in
                                 electromagnetic fields and the possibility of its use in the development of oil source field.
                                      Published results demonstrate intense heating of source rocks in electromagnetic
                                 field of a microwave and radio-frequency ranges. In particular, when exposed to mi-

                                 500 ◦ C/min [19–21].
                                      In addition, the effect of the electromagnetic field on the oil source rock in many
                                 cases leads to the development of stresses, fracturing, softening, and destruction of the
                                 rocks [22,23]. Thermal stresses arise as a result of the inhomogeneous thermal expansion of
                                 the rock during the heating process due to the difference in electromagnetic, thermal, and
                                 mechanical properties of minerals of rocks (quartz, feldspar, pyrite, clay and carbonates,
                                 and other).
                                      The objective of the work is the experimental study of electromagnetic heating of
                                 source rocks and structural changes in them on the example of samples representing the
                                 Bazhenov and the Domanic Formation. The experimental results are supplemented with
                                 the results of numerical modeling to evaluate temperature gradients arising in the bulk of
                                 the source rock samples and to determine the limits of temperature growth for Bazhenov
                                 and Domanic Formations samples when the time of electromagnetic impact is increased.
                                 An important part of the work is the numerical modeling based on a one-temperature
                                 mathematical model directed to evaluate the temperature gradients in the volume of the
                                 source rock samples.

                                   frequency of 13.56 MHz with an adjustable output power of up to 2.5 kW (Figure 2b).
                                   During the experiment, both microwave and radio-frequency generators were operated at

                                further rock structure characterization [24]. With the Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
                                MA, USA) Quattro S electron microscope source, rock samples 3–5 mm in size after the
                                experiment carefully prepared from the main samples were analyzed. The SEM tool allows
                                working with an electron beam current range from 1 pA to 200 nA with an accelerating
                                voltage range from 200 V to 30 kV. The maximum available spatial resolution is 1 nm.
                                SEM was performed in secondary electron (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE) modes
                                with ×500–200 K magnification, acceleration voltage 10–15 kV, working distance 9–11 mm,
                                and an image size 1536 × 1094 px.

                                2.3. Rock-Eval Pyrolysis
                                      Investigation of source rock pyrolytic parameters such as quality and quantity of
                                organic matter was performed using HAWK Resource Workstation (Wildcat Technologies,
                                San Diego, CA, USA) according to the Basic/Bulk-Rock method [25,26]. For the analysis,
                                approximately 100 mg of powder from each sample were prepared. The powders were
                                analyzed before the experiments and main pyrolytic parameters were obtained such as
                                total organic carbon (TOC) content, S1, S2, S3.

                                2.4. X-ray Diffraction Analysis
                                     Mineral composition of the samples was investigated using X-ray Diffraction powder
                                analysis technique using Huber G670 with transmission geometry (linear PSD detector, Co
                                tube (Ka1 = 1.78892 Å, 1200 W) and automatic monochromatic system). Approximately
                                50 mg of powder from each sample were prepared for the analysis. The powders were
                                analyzed before the experiment and the mineral composition was obtained for each sample.

                                2.5. Optical Microscopy
                                      The surface structure of the samples before and after exposure to an electromagnetic
                                field was investigated using an Olympus IX71 optical microscope. Based on the research
                                results, an assessment of the formation and evolution of cracks on the surface of the samples
                                was carried out.

                                        X-ray Diffraction powder analysis results are given in Table 4. The analysis showed
                                   that Bazhenov Formation samples are predominantly represented by quartz and clay-
                                   rich rocks with variant fractions of quartz and clay components, only the sample B4 is
                                   represented with limestone. Domanic Formation samples are quite similar in terms of
                                   mineral composition and are defined as limestone.
                                        During electromagnetic treatment, both thermal effect (temperature increase) and
                                   structural effect (fractures appearance) on the samples were observed.
                                        Consider first the results of the thermal effect of electromagnetic field on the samples.
                                   To quantify the thermal effect of the electromagnetic field let us introduce the average
                                                                .
                                   heating rate of the sample q that is defined as the ratio of the temperature change achieved
                                   to the duration of the electromagnetic treatment.

                                     possible explanation for such unusual behavior is that the sample D3 was recovered from

                                     sources density depends on the distribution of the electric field strength in the medium
                                     and on the dielectric properties of the medium. Since the wavelength of electromagnetic
                                     radiation is larger than the characteristic dimensions of the samples considered, the depen-
                                     dence of the distributed heat sources density on the electric field strength can be neglected.
                                     Therefore, in numerical simulation the distributed heat sources density was taken as a
                                     constant value which was uniformly distributed over the volume of the sample. The
                                     particular value of the distributed heat sources density was determined in the process

                                           Whereas the temperature of the sample surface was measured in the experiments, the
                                     numerical simulation allows one to obtain the temperature at all points of the sample. The

                                       The analysis of the curves that is shown in Figure 13a allows one to conclude that
                                  an increase in the time of the microwave treatment will lead to a further increase in the
                                  temperature of all the samples and will allow to reach the temperatures of 400–500 ◦ C
                                  required for the pyrolysis of kerogen. The same conclusion cannot be drawn for the case
                                  of the radio-frequency treatment since it is clearly seen in Figure 13b that the heating
                                  rate decreases and an increase in treatment time will most likely not lead to a significant
                                  increase of the sample temperature.
                                       However, it should be noted that there is some difference in the qualitative behav-
                                  ior of temperature under the microwave impact in physical and numerical experiments
                                  (Figure 13a). After the temperature reached a certain value, the heating rate of the samples
                                  was decreased. The same was observed with the intensity of the temperature rise. But the
                                  numerical results demonstrate a linear increase in temperature with constant heating rate.
                                  Possible explanation for this discrepancy is a change in the dielectric parameters of the
                                  source rock that occurs with an increase in the temperature of the samples, which was not
                                  taken into account in the mathematical model.

                                   .                                                                    .

                                  der electromagnetic exposure which was used for the numerical modeling. Obviously, such
                                  a different value of the density of heat sources is due to the difference in the chemical com-
                                  position of the samples. It can be concluded that the dielectric properties of the Domanic
                                  Formation samples are observed in such a way that the dissipation of the electromagnetic
                                  energy is small at the given frequency of the radio-frequency field.

                         4. Discussion
                               It was discovered that the average heating rate of the Bazhenov Formation samples
                         can be an order of magnitude higher than the one of the Domanik Formation samples both
                         in the microwave and radio-frequency fields. For instance, one of the Bazhenov Formation
                         samples had the average heating rate in the microwave field of 1.5 ◦ C/s, and in the radio-
                         frequency field it was slightly less (1.2 ◦ C/s, at the same output power of the magnetron
                         and radio-frequency generator). At the same time, the corresponding values of the average
                         heating rate for the Domanic Formation sample were 0.15 ◦ C/s (microwave) and 0.09 ◦ C/s
                         (radio-frequency). This effect may be caused by several factors. The first one is the
                         mineral composition. According to the XRD data Bazhenov Formation samples contain clay
                         minerals (up to 49 wt%) where one can observe additional absorption of the electromagnetic
                         field energy. The second factor is the organic matter composition. Bazhenov Formation
                         samples are considerably enriched with light hydrocarbons (S1 parameter varies in the
                         range of 3.50–8.39 mg HC/g rock) whereas Domanik Formation samples do not share
                         the same properties. The third factor has to do with differences of water amount in the
                         rocks. According to Kazak et al. [31,32], Bazhenov Formation rocks contain an order
                         of magnitude which contain more water than Domanik Formation rocks (1–8 wt% and
                         0.1–0.5 wt%, respectively).
                               The comparison of heating rates in the separate microwave and radio-frequency field
                         experiments with the mineral composition shows no obvious trends. This may be explained
                         by similar properties of the minerals with regard to the electromagnetic field impact in the
                         particular experiment conditions. However, one should note that the combination of S1
                         and S2 pyrolysis parameters does make difference. The samples with lower S1 tend to have
                         a lower heating rate (sample D2) whereas the samples with higher S1 have a significantly
                         higher heating rate (samples B1–B4). This observation means that light hydrocarbons may
                         directly influence the heating of the rocks under the electromagnetic impact.
                               The developed mathematical and computer models of the electromagnetic heating
                         process make it possible to predict the dynamics of sample heating. To obtain adequate
                         results of the numerical modeling, it is important to correctly specify the function of the
                         density of the distributed heat sources. One should take into account the temperature
                         dependences of the dielectric properties of the source rock and the inhomogeneity of the
                         electric field distribution in the sample.
                               The results of the numerical modeling have confirmed that the sample temperature can
                         be increased up to 400–500 ◦ C if one increases the time of the microwave exposure which is
                         required for the pyrolysis of kerogen. A completely different dynamics of temperature was
                         observed under the radio-frequency impact; the samples were heated slowly and it was
                         not possible to reach the temperature of kerogen pyrolysis since the heat exchange with the
                         environment turned out to play a significant role.
                               The results of the mathematical modeling have shown that the density of the dis-
                         tributed heat sources under the microwave exposure is an order of magnitude higher than
                         under the radio-frequency exposure. This means that the microwave exposure gives a
                         more intense but local effect which leads to cracking of the samples. The radio-frequency
                         exposure does not lead to the same effect. However, it can lead to an increase in the
                         radio-frequency exposure coverage factor as compared to the microwave exposure. It was
                         also found that in the process of the radio-frequency and microwave exposure in the rock
                         samples, in addition to reaching high temperatures, temperature differentiation is also
                         observed; the temperature difference in the center of the sample and on its surface can
                         reach the point of 20 ◦ C and more. In this case, if the inhomogeneity of the absorption of
                         the field energy in a real medium is observed, the temperature gradient may turn out to be
                         much higher. Such high values of the temperature gradient stimulate the appearance of
                         powerful temperature stresses in the sample which lead to formation of fractures under
                         certain conditions.

                                  5. Conclusions
                                        In conclusion, it should be noted that the results of the experimental and numerical
                                  studies show the presence of both thermal and force effects of the microwave (2.4 GHz)
                                  and radio-frequency (13.56 MHz) electromagnetic field on the oil source Bazhenov and
                                  Domanic rock samples. The thermal effect of the microwave treatment on the source rock
                                  samples is much more intense than that of the radio-frequency influence. The temperature
                                  of the investigated Bazhenov Formation samples reached 300 ◦ C within one hundred
                                  seconds under the microwave treatment, but the sample temperature slowly rose up only
                                  to 200 ◦ C after twelve minutes of the radio-frequency influence. This is due to the fact that
                                  the radio-frequency field mainly affects the oil polar components and there is no mature oil
                                  and polar components in the source rock samples.
                                        An important and encouraging result of the electromagnetic exposure is the oil source
                                  rock sample cracking. The formation of fractures was observed on all the samples under
                                  both the microwave and radio-frequency exposure. Achievement of high temperatures
                                  under the microwave exposure in under relatively short period of time (several minutes)
                                  leads to the appearance of thermoelastic stresses in the samples. The greater the difference
                                  in the heating intensity of individual components and phases is, the more noticeable the
                                  stresses are. This phenomenon is confirmed by the formation of cracks which are observed
                                  under the microwave exposure on all the samples.
                                        The scientific results which were obtained in this work and the accumulated world
                                  experience which was considered in the practical implementation of the microwave and
                                  radio-frequency treatment in situ make it possible to believe that these methods of treatment
                                  will be successfully implemented for oil source rock field development in the nearest future.
                                  For the successful application of the electromagnetic technologies it is necessary to carry
                                  out a deeper experimental study of real source rock samples for a particular field and the
                                  detailed mathematical modeling of the electromagnetic treatment process.
