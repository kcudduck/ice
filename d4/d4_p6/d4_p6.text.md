         The experiment of dielectric barrier discharge in a 2 mm air gap shows that the pressure range of
         a uniform discharge using polytetrafluoroethylene as barrier is much wider than that using quartz or
         alumina. The parameters of the charge trapped on the surface of these three dielectric barriers were
         obtained by surface charge measurement and thermally stimulated current measurement. It was
         found that surface charge trapping has much influence on the uniform discharge, i.e., the seed
         electrons necessary for uniform discharge may be produced by the desorption of the absorbed
         electrons in the shallow trap with energy level lower than 1 eV. © 2008 American Institute of

letter, we correlate the results from three experiments and
show the effect of the charge trapped in the shallow traps of

uniform DBD in a 2 mm air gap could be produced with

alumina, and 1 mm thick plate of quartz. Two plane-parallel
electrodes are 50 mm in diameter, each covered by one di-
electric plate. The electrode system was put inside a test
chamber. With the pressure of the test chamber rising from
10 Pa to 50 kPa, it could be observed that the discharge tran-
