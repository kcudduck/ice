SUMMARY

Electrical conductivity of most minerals is sensitive to hydrogen (water) content,

temperature, major element chemistry and oxygen fugacity. The influence of these

parameters on electrical conductivity of major minerals has been characterized for most

of the lower crust, upper mantle and transition zone minerals. When the results of

properly executed experimental studies are selected, the main features of electrical

conductivity in minerals can be interpreted by the physical models of impurity-assisted

conduction involving ferric iron and hydrogen-related defects. Systematic trends in

hydrogen-related conductivity are found among different types of hydrogen-bearing

minerals that are likely caused by the difference in the mobility of hydrogen. A

comparison of experimental results with geophysically inferred conductivity shows: (1)

Electrical conductivity of the continental lower crust can be explained by a combination

of high temperature, high (ferric) iron content presumably associated with dehydration.

(2) Electrical conductivity of the asthenosphere can be explained by a modest amount of

water (~10-2 wt% in most regions, less than 10-3 wt% in the central/western Pacific). (3)

Electrical conductivity of the transition zone requires a higher water content (~10-1 wt%

in most regions, ~10-3 wt% in the southern European transition zone, ~1 wt% in the East

Asian transition zone). The majority of observations including those on the lower crust

and the asthenosphere can be interpreted without partial melting or any fluids.

   However, experimental studies on electrical conductivity of lower mantle minerals

are incomplete and it is not known if hydrogen enhances the conductivity of lower mantle

minerals or not. Some discussions are also presented on the electrical conductivity in

other planetary bodies including the Moon and Mars.

INTRODUCTION


        Seismic wave velocities and electrical conductivity are among the physical

properties that can be estimated from geophysical remote sensing techniques. However,

inferring electrical conductivity is more challenging and subject to larger uncertainties

than for seismic wave velocities (see a Chapter by A. Schultz). Consequently, although

the basic framework of the inference of electrical conductivity from electromagnetic

induction has long been known (see e.g., (Banks, 1969, Rikitake, 1966)), progress in the

study of electrical conductivity and its applications to Earth’s interior have been slow

until recently.

        It might seem that because the resolution of electrical conductivity is much lower

than that of seismic wave velocities, studies of electrical conductivity have secondary

importance compared to the study of seismic wave velocities and elasticity. However, the

sensitivity of these two properties to various parameters is different and the use of these

observables is complementary. For instance, seismic wave velocities are highly sensitive

to the major element chemistry and crystal structure (see a Chapter by Murakami,

Tsuchiya and Kawai) but relatively insensitive to water content. In contrast, electrical

conductivity is highly sensitive to water content and relatively insensitive to other factors

as we will show in this paper. Therefore in order to infer the water distribution, electrical

conductivity plays a primary role (see also (Karato, 2011)). The approaches using these

two observables are complementary and by using both of them, one can get a detailed

knowledge of composition and evolution of Earth.

        Hydrogen (water) has important influence on rheological properties (e.g., (Karato

and Jung, 2003, Mei and Kohlstedt, 2000)) and melting relationship (e.g., (Kushiro et al.,
                                                                                           4

1968, Inoue, 1994)) that control the dynamics and evolution of Earth and other terrestrial

planets (see also Chapters by Keppler, Iwamori, van Keken and Karato). In some regions

of the mantle such as the highly depleted lithosphere, there is essentially no water (less

than a few wt ppm) whereas in certain regions ~1 wt % of water is inferred to be present

(Stolper and Newman, 1994). Therefore the range of water content in Earth’s mantle

spans more than four orders of magnitude. However, these estimates are from

petrological studies and the spatial distribution of water is poorly constrained.

Consequently, if one can infer the water content with an uncertainty of a factor of ~2, this

will be a major improvement of our understanding of water distribution and hence the

dynamics and evolution of Earth (and other planets)1. According to a model by (Karato,

1990), the electrical conductivity is proportional to the water content (minor revision is

needed for some minerals as we will discuss later), so if one can infer electrical

conductivity within a factor of ~2 and if the influence of other factors is small or properly

corrected, then one can make an important advancement in our understanding of water

distribution in the current Earth’s mantle. Consequently, a large number of papers have

been published on this topic after 1990.

       However, the measurements and the interpretation of experimental results on

electrical conductivity are not straightforward, particularly those on samples with

hydrogen (water), and there have been some confusions in the community. As a result,

somewhat different results have been published and largely different models were

proposed on the distribution of hydrogen from electrical conductivity. For example,

(Huang et al., 2005, Karato, 2011) proposed a relatively high water content (~0.1 wt %)

1
  The uncertainties in the geochemical estimate of water content are similar (e.g.,
Hirschmann (1006)).
                                                                                          5

in the transition zone, whereas (Yoshino et al., 2008a, Yoshino, 2010) proposed a dry

(water-free) transition zone. Therefore it seems important to review the basic physics of

electrical conductivity, including the technical issues on the experimental methods, to

evaluate the validity of different results and models.

       In this paper, we will first review the basic physics of electrical conductivity and

point defects in minerals and discuss some issues on the experimental studies and their

interpretation. Then important experimental results will be summarized and the

microscopic mechanisms of electrical conduction in minerals will be reviewed. Finally,

the results will be applied to infer the physical and chemical state of Earth and planetary

(mostly the Moon) interiors from electrical conductivity.




MICROSCOPIC PHYSICS OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY


Some fundamentals

       When an electric field is applied, electrical current flows in materials due to the

motion of charged particles (electrons and/or ions). Therefore the electrical conductivity

is proportional to the number density of charged particles and their mobility. In most

cases there is a linear relationship between the electrical current and the applied electric

field E (the Ohm’s law), and the proportional coefficient is the electrical conductivity,

I = σ E . Therefore one has



        σ = q nµ                                                            (1)
                                                                                            6

where q is the charge of the particle that carries the current, n is the number density of the

particle and µ = υ / E is the mobility where υ is the drift velocity of the particle. When

there are multiple charged species that carry the electric current, equation (1) should be

modified to σ = ∑ qi ni µi (each quantity with a suffix i refers to a quantity for the i-th
                   i


species) and the electrical conductivity is dominated by the motion of charged species

that has the highest qi ni µi .

        In metals, the number of charge carriers is fixed (=number of free electrons), and

the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity comes only from that of mobility.

The mobility of free electrons is controlled by the scattering by phonons and weakly

dependent on temperature, µ ∝ T1 (T: temperature) (e.g., (Kittel, 1986)). Most of

minerals are semi-conductors or insulators where mobile charged particles are present

only by thermal activation and their concentrations are highly sensitive to the amount of

impurities as well as temperature. In addition, the mobility of charge carriers in minerals

is often highly sensitive to temperature. Therefore the electrical conductivity in minerals

is not only sensitive to temperature but also sensitive to parameters that control the

activities of impurities including water and oxygen fugacity. Consequently, there is a

potential to infer the distribution of these chemical factors (as well as temperatures) from

the study of electrical conductivity that are otherwise difficult to infer. In the following,

we will first review the fundamentals of mechanisms of electrical conduction in minerals,

and review some experimental issues, and then summarize the results of laboratory

studies and their interpretation and applications.

Electrical conductivity and impurities

Intrinsic conductivity

        A typical silicate or oxide mineral free from transition metals such as MgO

(periclase) or Mg2SiO4 (forsterite) is an insulator in which all electrons are strongly

bound to the atomic nuclei. In these materials, all electrons belong to the filled bands and

they become mobile only when an electron is removed from the filled valence band to the

empty conduction band by thermal activation (Fig. 1). The creation of these mobile

electrons and holes can be described by



         perfect crystal ⇔ e′ + hi                                                       (2)




where e′ is electron (with excess negative charge) and hi is hole (with positive effective

charge). From the law of mass action and the requirement of charge neutrality by these

two defects, one has [ e′ ] = ⎡⎣ hi ⎤⎦ ∝ exp − (   2 RT
                                                       Eg
                                                            ) where [ x ] denotes the concentration of a
species x. Using this relation, and considering that the density of state of electrons

follows the Fermi statistics, the electrical conductivity can be given by (e.g., (Ziman,

1960, Kittel, 1986)),




                 ( ) ⋅ ( m m ) ⋅ ( µ + µ ) ⋅ exp (− )

                                e   h              e        h                                   (3)
                    h                                                 2 RT




where k is the Boltzmann constant, R is the gas constant (R=NAk, NA: the Avogadro

number), h is the Planck constant, me,h is the effective mass of electron or hole
                                                                                          8


respectively, µe,h is the mobility of electron or hole, and Eg is the band gap (Fig. 1).

These thermally activated electrons or holes behave like free electrons. In most cases, the

mobility of electrons (or holes) is controlled by phonon scattering and decreases with

temperature as µe,h ∝ T1 (Kittel, 1986) (the slight difference between free electrons in

metals and electrons and hole non-metallic solids is expressed by the effective mass).

       Because the band gap is large for most minerals (several hundreds of kJ/mol)

(Nitsan and Shankland, 1976), the contribution from this intrinsic conduction mechanism

is small. For instance for Mg2SiO4 (forsterite) the electrical conductivity at 1500 K is

~10-4 S/m (Schock et al., 1989). In comparison, the electrical conductivity of iron-bearing

olivine is ~ 10-3 S/m for hydrogen-free conditions (Constable et al., 1992), and it is ~10-1

S/m for hydrogen-rich olivine at the same temperature (Wang et al., 2006). Therefore, the

electrical conductivity in typical minerals is usually due to some “impurities” such as

ferric iron and hydrogen (Fig. 2).

       The electrical conductivity in iron-bearing minerals can still be “intrinsic”, i.e.,

conductivity could occur by the formation of a pair of electrons and holes through

reaction (5). However, if this were the dominant mechanism of conduction, then the

electrical conductivity would be independent of oxygen fugacity. Laboratory

observations on hydrogen-free but iron-bearing minerals often show a positive

dependence of electrical conductivity on oxygen fugacity (e.g., (Schock et al., 1989)),

showing that the intrinsic conduction is not important in most cases.

       In the following we will review two important mechanisms of the electrical

conductivity in minerals where impurities play an essential role. When the electrical

conductivity is controlled by impurities, the electrical conductivity increases with the
                                                                                           9

impurity content. However, the relation between the conductivity and impurity content is

not always linear. The best-known impurity conduction is the electrical conduction in

impurity-doped semi-conductors such as boron-doped Si. In these cases, the charge

balance is maintained by the ionization of impurity atoms themselves and if the

concentration of impurities is high, electrical conductivity is proportional to      N (N:

impurity content) (Kittel, 1986). We will discuss a similar case in hydrogen conduction.

In the following we will review the relationship between electrical conductivity and

thermo-chemical parameters.



Conductivity due to iron

       Outer electrons (in the d-orbit) of Fe (iron) are only weakly bound to the nucleus.

Consequently, it is easy to remove an electron from Fe ion to change the valence state

from ferrous ( Fe2+ ) to ferric ( Fe 3+ ). Ferric iron is an “impurity” in most of minerals

                                                                             (
where normally ferrous iron occupies the site for doubly charged cation Mg 2+ , Fe2+ .     )
Consequently ferric iron will produce an impurity level in the band gap to which

electrons from the filled valence band can be activated to change ferric iron to ferrous

iron (Fig. 1). Because this energy level accepts an electron from the valence band, it is

sometimes referred to as an “acceptor level”. When this transition occurs by thermal

activation, then electric current is carried by (i) hopping of an electron between ferric and

ferrous iron or by (ii) the motion of electron hole created in the valence band.

       Let us now consider how the presence of such an impurity changes electrical

                                                                                          i
conductivity. In case of iron-bearing minerals, defects such as ferric iron at M-site ( FeM

(Kröger-Vink notation)) are formed by the chemical reaction of mineral with the
                                                                                              10

atmosphere, and the charge balance is maintained by atomic defects, e.g.,


      ⎦ = 2 [VM′′ ] ( VM′′ is the M-site vacancy). This leads to ⎣ FeM ⎦ ∝ fO2 (somewhat
⎡ FeM
    i ⎤                                                          ⎡ i ⎤      1/ 6
⎣

different relationships can be obtained if one assumes different charge neutrality

conditions (e.g., (Karato, 1973, Schock et al., 1989)), but conductivity by ferric iron-

related species always increases with oxygen fugacity). The electron holes are created

from the ferric iron,



          i     ×
        FeM ⇔ FeM + hi .                                                          (4)



        ×
where FeM denotes Fe2+ at M-site and hi is an electron hole. Applying the law of mass

action, one finds that

( K 4 = K 40 exp − RT4 ). In this case, the electrical conduction occurs either by “hopping”

of electrons between ferric and ferrous iron or by the conduction by electron hole, and the

electrical conductivity may be written as

                      i ⎤
                        ⎦ µ Fei             for hopping                           (6a)

and Roberts, 1997) discussed the mobility of these defects in olivine.

          Another well-documented conduction mechanism related to iron is ionic

conduction by the diffusion of Mg (or Fe). In addition to the migration of electrons (or

holes) just described, ions themselves may carry the electric charge. Because ions have

electric charge, they migrate when the electric field is applied. This is called ionic

conductivity. The relation between diffusion and electrical conductivity is known as the

Nernst-Einstein relation (e.g., (Mott and Gurney, 1940)),



                 f ⋅D⋅n⋅q 2
          σ=        RT
                                                                              (7)



where n is the concentration of ionic species (per unit volume for a mole), q is the electric

charge of that species, D is the diffusion coefficient of the charged species, and f is a non-

dimensional constant representing the geometrical factor (f~1) (mobility in this case is

     Dq
µ = RT ). Given the concentration and diffusion coefficient of any charged species, one

can calculate the electrical conductivity. An obvious mechanism is the electric current

carried by the diffusion of constituent ions such as Mg 2+ ( Fe2+ ). Indeed, several authors

suggested that this is an important conduction mechanism in olivine at high temperatures

(e.g., (Karato, 1973, Constable, 2006)). These analyses together with the latest results on
                                                                                          12

diffusion coefficients suggest that the contribution from diffusion of Mg (Fe) is relatively

minor compared to the contributions from electronic mechanisms of conduction.

        In all cases for iron-related conduction, the electrical conductivity is proportional

to the concentration of ferric iron, viz.,



        σ ∝ ⎡⎣ FeM
                 i ⎤
                   ⎦.                                                        (8)




This relation is different from the well-known relationship for p- or n-type

semiconductors (for these materials σ ∝ N if impurity concentration is high). The

reason is that in iron-bearing minerals, the charge balance is not directly determined by

the ionization reaction of iron itself, but it involves chemical reaction with atmosphere

(when conduction is due to hydrogen-related defects, the charge balance is sometimes

maintained by the ionization reaction. Under these circumstances, one finds

σ ∝ [ H ] ∝ Cwr with r<1 ( Cw : water content)).
         r



        Since the most important defect for this mechanism is ferric iron whose

concentration increases with oxygen fugacity, the electrical conductivity by this

mechanism increases with oxygen fugacity. So in general, the electrical conductivity can

be written as




        σ Fe ∝ fO2
                q
                        (   H*
                   exp − RTFe    )                                   (9)
                                                                                              13


where we used a suffix Fe to indicate the quantity is for iron-related mechanism, fO2 is

oxygen fugacity, q is the oxygen fugacity exponent (q>0) and H Fe is activation enthalpy.

The details of this mechanism will be discussed later when we examine the experimental

observations.

        The electrical conduction by the charge transfer between ferric and ferrous iron

(or electron holes created by iron) is often referred to as “(small) polaron” conduction in

the geophysical literature (e.g., (Xu et al., 1998b)). The term “polaron” is used to

emphasize the fact that the motion of electrons (or holes) in these cases is so slow that

moving electrons polarize the surrounding crystal and hence the resistance for electron

motion is modified (Yamashita and Kurosawa, 1958) (see also (Bosman and van Daal,

1970)). In other words, the concept of “polaron” was proposed to explain the nature of

mobility of electrons. However, the issues of density of charge carrier (its dependence on

temperature and chemical environment) are more important in geophysics, and we will

not use the term “polaron” (either small or large) in this paper.

        (Pearson and Bardeen, 1949) (see also (Debye and Conwell, 1954)) developed a

model for impurity conduction where they proposed that the activation energy (enthalpy)

for      conduction         may          depend     on      the     impurity       concentration,


               ⎣       (           )
σ ∝ N 1/ 2 exp ⎡ − HRT* 1 − α N 1/ 3 ⎤
                                     ⎦
                                          (N:   impurity   concentration)   for   high   impurity

concentration. The idea is that the activation energy for electrical conductivity includes

ionization energy that may be affected by the electric field produced by impurities

themselves (electric field ∝ N 1/ 3 ). However, this effect is weak (it affects the activation

energy only when the impurity concentration is ~0.1 % or higher), and its effect is

present only when the impurity has an effective charge (excess positive or negative
                                                                                         14

charge compared to the perfect crystal (this is the case for p-, n-type semiconductors)). In

most of minerals, the concentration of charged defects is small (the total content of

hydrogen can be high, but the majority of hydrogen-related defects is a neutral defect)

and this effect will be ignored2.



Conduction due to hydrogen

                                                                                   (
       In addition to the electrical conduction due to the diffusion of Mg 2+ Fe2+ ,      )
diffusion of hydrogen may play an important role in the electrical conduction because of

the high mobility and potentially large concentration of hydrogen in minerals (Karato,

1990). In the simple model proposed by (Karato, 1990), it was assumed that all the

dissolved hydrogen atoms (protons) (in olivine) contribute equally to electrical

conductivity, and diffusion coefficient in equation (7) was identified with the chemical

diffusion coefficient measured by (Mackwell and Kohlstedt, 1990). In this model,

electrical conductivity will be related to the total amount of dissolved water, CW , water

fugacity, f H 2O , and oxygen fugacity, fO2 as




        σ ∝ CW DW ≈ ⎡( 2H )M ⎤ DW ∝ f H 2O fO2
                           ×                0
                                               DW .                         (10)

  Yoshino et al. (2008) (see also Yoshino, 2010) argued that the activation energy in
minerals containing hydrogen defects depends on the water concentration and applied a
formula proposed by Pearson and Bardeen (1949) and Debye and Conwell (1954).
However, the use of this model to hydrogen conduction is inappropriate because the
dominant hydrogen-bearing defect is neutral relative to the perfect crystal (as discussed
later). Yang et al. (2011a,b) reached the same conclusion.
                                                                                         15


where DW is the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen (water) and we use a model that

hydrogen is dissolved in olivine mainly as a neutral defect, ( 2H )M (Kohlstedt et al.,
                                                                      ×



1996). In this model, the electrical conductivity increases linearly with water content but

independent of oxygen fugacity. Also, the activation energy and anisotropy of electrical

conductivity (at a fixed hydrogen content) are the same as those of diffusion.

        As we will discuss later, the subsequent studies demonstrated that the dissolution

of hydrogen indeed enhances the electrical conductivity in most minerals. However, these

studies also showed that some modifications are needed to the initial idea (the activation

energy of electrical conductivity is less than that of diffusion, the water content exponent

is often less than 1, conductivity is sensitive to oxygen fugacity). An important point is

that equation (7) must be generalized where multiple charged species take part in

electrical conductivity, i.e.,



                  f D n q2
        σ = ∑ i RT
                i i i
                                                                            (11)
              i




where a quantity with a suffix i refers to a quantity for the i-th species. Even for a given

element such as hydrogen, there are multiple hydrogen-related species in a given material

at a given condition as shown by (Nishihara et al., 2008) for wadsleyite. In these cases,

the concentration of hydrogen-related species that contributes mostly to conductivity is

not necessarily the most abundant hydrogen-bearing species and therefore the electrical

conductivity is not necessarily linearly proportional to the total hydrogen (water)

concentration.
                                                                                             16

           The addition of hydrogen will also enhance electrical conductivity through the

enhancement of diffusion of other species such as Mg (Fe) (Hier-Majumder et al., 2005).

Diffusion of Fe (Mg) in olivine or other iron-bearing minerals occurs, in most cases, by

the vacancy mechanism, i.e., through the exchange of Fe (Mg) with the M-site (Mg or

Fe-site) vacancies, VM′′ . The charge balance in these minerals is dominated by M-site

vacancies and ferric iron, ⎡⎣ FeM ⎦ = 2 [VM′′ ] . In these cases, the electrical conductivity is
                                i ⎤



proportional to ferric iron concentration, and the relation similar to equation (8) or (9)

holds (the same oxygen fugacity dependence) although the activation energy for

conduction is the same as that for Mg (Fe) diffusion.

           Also there is an interaction between ionic and electronic defects in minerals.

When charged ionic defects are introduced to a mineral, these defects create electrons or

holes. Such a reaction is well known for iron-related defects (reaction (4)). (Wang et al.,

2011b) showed that a similar situation will arise for charged hydrogen-related defects.

Consequently, ionic and electronic defects need to be considered simultaneously.

           These issues will be discussed later when we review experimental and theoretical

results.



Electrical conductivity of a multi-phase aggregate

Averaging scheme

           Rocks are made of various minerals with different orientations including some

fluid phases and grain-boundaries. When different phases have largely different electrical

conductivity, then the averaging scheme becomes an important issue. (McLachlan et al.,

1990) reviewed such an averaging scheme. In most of practical purposes, the Hashin-
                                                                                                 17

Shtrikman’s upper and lower bounds provide good estimates of the electrical

conductivity of a mixture. The upper (or lower) bound is given by



                               +/−
         +/−
       σ HS  = σ n + A +/−
                      A
                                                                                     (12)

is the conductivity of the i‐th component, and σ n is the maximum (or minimum)

conductivity (Hashin and Shtrikman, 1962). When we apply the results of electrical

conductivity measurements for individual minerals to calculate the electrical

conductivity of a rock, we will use these relationships. (Simpson and Tommasi, 2005)

discussed the application of such a model to calculate the anisotropy in electrical

conductivity in an aggregate with non-random crystallographic orientations.




Influence of element partitioning

       In a multi-phase aggregate, various elements are distributed among co-existing

minerals. The concentration ratios of these elements are controlled by thermo-chemical

equilibrium, and these ratios are referred to as partition coefficients. Particularly

important is the partition coefficients of hydrogen. Experimental studies on hydrogen

partitioning have been conducted (e.g., (Hauri et al., 2006)) and these results are needed

to develop a model of conductivity-depth profile. Because the solubility of an element

depends on the physical and chemical conditions, the partition coefficients are dependent

on the physical and chemical conditions and not the constants (Karato, 2008a). For
                                                                                        18

instance, the partition coefficient of hydrogen between olivine and orthopyroxene

changes with the total water content (i.e., the water fugacity) by more than a factor of 10

in the upper mantle (Dai and Karato, 2009a). In evaluating the influence of hydrogen

partitioning, such an effect needs to be taken into account.



Influence of grain-boundaries

       Grain-boundaries are present in any polycrystalline aggregates. Grain-boundaries

may enhance or may reduce electrical conduction. When electronic conduction

dominates, grain-boundaries act as barriers for the electric current. When ionic

conduction plays an important role, grain-boundaries may enhance conduction if grain-

boundary diffusion is enhanced. (Roberts and Tyburczy, 1991) and (ten Grotenhuis et al.,

2004) studied the influence of grain-size on the electrical conductivity in olivine

aggregates. (ten Grotenhuis et al., 2004) found a clear evidence for the contribution of

grain-boundary diffusion for their fine-grained synthetic forsterite samples (~1-5 µ m).

However, a comparison to single crystal data by (Schock et al., 1989) shows that the

grain-boundary effect is not important for grain-size larger than ~0.1 mm. Because a

typical grain-size in the mantle is several mm (Avé Lallemant et al., 1980), we conclude

that the influence of grain-size is not important in most of the Earth’s mantle. (Yang and

Heidelbach, 2012) also obtained the same conclusion for clinopyroxene.



Influence of fluid phases

       Fluids in general have high ionic conductivity and therefore if fluids are present

they enhance the electrical conductivity of a rock. Both aqueous fluids (in the crust) and
                                                                                         19

silicate or carbonatite melts are often invoked to explain high electrical conductivity. The

degree to which the presence of fluids affects the electrical conductivity depends on (i)

the conductivity ratio of the fluid and mineral, (ii) the volume fraction of the fluid and

(iii) the geometry of the fluids (dihedral angle if the fluid geometry is controlled by the

interfacial tension).

        The influence of partial melt on electrical conductivity was discussed by

(Shankland and Waff, 1977), but new experimental observations suggest that some

modifications are needed (e.g., (Gaillard et al., 2008, Yoshino et al., 2010)). We will

provide a review on the importance of fluids including partial melting incorporating new

laboratory and geophysical observations.

        Similar to the influence of a fluid phase, the influence of graphite is sometimes

proposed (e.g., (Duba and Shankland, 1982)). Graphite has a very high (and anisotropic)

conductivity and therefore even a small amount of carbon can enhance conductivity if

carbon assumes a connected phase. (Yoshino and Noritake, 2011) studied this issue for

the quartz-carbon system and found that carbon does not assume a connected geometry

and its influence on electrical conductivity is small. The geometry of carbon in an

aggregate is controlled by the interfacial tension and therefore depends on minerals.

Similar studies on mantle minerals have not been conducted.



ISSUES ON THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES


        The measurements of electrical conductivity are relatively simple compared to the

measurements of rheological properties (e.g., (Karato, 2008a) and a Chapter by Karato in

this book). However, measurements of electrical conductivity in minerals have important
                                                                                           20

details that need to be discussed to understand the possible causes of different, sometimes

conflicting results.



Impedance spectroscopy

        Under some conditions, electrical conduction in mineral occurs through the

diffusion of ions (ionic conductivity). In these cases, when conductivity is measured

using an electrode, moving ions must exchange electrons with an electrode. This requires

a finite time, and consequently, finite number of electric charge is accumulated at the

electrode forming a capacitor. Similarly, when grain-boundary acts as a barrier for the

electric current, then a capacitor will develop at grain-boundaries. In these cases, an

equivalent circuit is a parallel combination of a resister (R) and a capacitor (C), leading to

the frequency dependent impedance. The influence of capacitance needs to be corrected

by analyzing the whole spectrum of impedance including in-phase ( Z ′ ) as well as out-of-

phase ( Z ′′ ) response ( Z = Z ′ − iZ ′′ , Z: electric impedance, i = −1 ). Such a method is

often called the impedance spectroscopy (Macdonald, 1987) (Fig. 3).

        For this particular model, Z is given by



        Z = 1+iωR RC                                                          (13)



where ω is the frequency. In such a measurement, a combination of in-phase and out-

phase impedance can be plotted on the Z ′ − Z ′′ plane (called a Cole-Cole plot (Cole and

Cole, 1941)),
                                                                                            21


        ( Z ′ (ω ) , Z ′′ (ω )) = 1+ω RR C (1,ω RC ) .
                                  2 2   2
                                                                             (14)




For a model of parallel combination of a resister and a capacitor, the curve

( Z ′ (ω ) , Z ′′ (ω )) defines a half circle on the Z ′ − Z ′′ plane (this can be shown by
eliminating ω from equation (14)) (Fig. 3a). By fitting the experimental data to this

model, one can calculate the resistivity (and hence the conductivity).

       In some of the previous studies, only one frequency was used and the resistance

was determined by assuming Z ′ = R (e.g., (Yoshino et al., 2006, Katsura et al., 1998,

Yoshino and Katsura, 2009, Yoshino et al., 2008b)). Such a method can be justified only

when ω RC  1 because the correct relationship is Z ′ =           R
                                                                           . This inequality is
                                                             1+ω 2 R 2 C 2


satisfied when both resistance (R) and capacitance (C) are low. This would be the case

when temperature is high (low R) and/or when the charge carrier is electron (or electron

hole) (low C). Otherwise, the assumption of Z ′ = R in the one, low frequency

measurements leads to a systematic error such as the apparent dependence of activation

energy on water content (Karato and Dai, 2009) (this point was also noted by (Yang et

al., 2011a, Yang et al., 2011b)).

       In some cases, the equivalent circuit may include additional pair of resister-

capacitor combination. This occurs, for instance, when two conduction mechanisms are

present in series, say grain-boundary conduction and intra-granular conduction (e.g.,

(Roberts and Tyburczy, 1991)). In these cases, the Z ′ − Z ′′ plot contains an additional

branch (two half circles, Fig. 3b), and the low-frequency data from such an experiments

cannot be used if they fall on the second branch.
                                                                                            22

       Another complication is a distorted half circle. In some cases, the half circle is

depressed in the Z ′′ direction (Fig. 3c). This occurs when the capacitance shows more

complex, distributed behavior so that equation (13) changes to Z =          R
                                                                                 α   (0 ≤ α <1;
                                                                     1+ ( iω RC )


e.g., (Cole and Cole, 1941, Roberts and Tyburczy, 1991, Huebner and Dillenburg,

1995)). Such a behavior was seen, for example, by (Dai and Karato, 2009c, Huebner and

Dillenburg, 1995, Reynard et al., 2011). In such a case, although the circle is distorted,

the intercepts of a distorted half circle with the Z ′ -axis are still 0 and R (same as the

undistorted half circle). Therefore as far as the dc-resistance is determined by the

intercept, one obtains a correct result.



Conductivity measurements of a hydrous sample

       Another practical, but important issue, is the fact that when hydrogen-sensitive

properties are studied, one needs to pay a great attention to minimize hydrogen loss or

gain during an experiment. Hydrogen may be lost during an experiment, but it may also

be added to a specimen during an experiment. Therefore in order to obtain reliable results

on a sample with some hydrogen (water), the hydrogen (water) content of a sample must

be measured both before and after the conductivity measurement, and the change in water

content must be small for the results to be accepted. Hydrogen loss during an experiment

likely occurs because hydrogen is highly mobile and most of the sample assembly for

electrical conductivity measurements is not closed. To minimize the hydrogen loss, one

could use relatively low temperatures, but one could also use a lower voltage. However,

the use of relatively low temperature creates a problem of extrapolation. In general,

activation energy of conduction increases with temperature and in such a case, the
                                                                                       23

extrapolation from low temperature results tends to underestimate the conductivity at

mantle (high) temperatures (Fig. 4). In particular, the electrical conductivity at high

temperatures due to enhanced diffusion of Mg (Fe) has never been identified by the direct

experimental studies of electrical conductivity because all previous studies on the

electrical conductivity of hydrous samples were made at relatively low temperatures (to

minimize hydrogen loss). The influence of enhanced Mg (Fe) diffusion will be evaluated

theoretically based on the experimental results on diffusion in the later section.

       Although only hydrogen loss is usually considered, attention should also be drawn

to hydrogen addition. A notable example is the case of a study by (Xu et al., 1998b). In

that pioneering study, they found that wadsleyite and ringwoodite have much higher

electrical conductivity than olivine, and interpreted that wadsleyite and ringwoodite

always have higher electrical conductivity. (Huang et al., 2005) measured the water

contents in the samples studied by (Xu et al., 1998b) and found that these samples of

wadsleyite and ringwoodite have a large water content and the higher electrical

conductivities of wadsleyite and ringwoodite than olivine is largely due to the higher

water contents of wadsleyite and ringwoodite than olivine. In fact, because these minerals

have high water solubility, it is difficult to synthesize truly dry wadsleyite and

ringwoodite (Nishihara et al., 2006). Truly dry wadsleyite has similar electrical

conductivity to dry olivine (Dai and Karato, 2009c, Karato, 2011). Similarly “dry”

majorite used by (Yoshino et al., 2008b) contains a large amount (~0.1 wt %) of water.

These results should not be interpreted as results for “dry” minerals. (Yoshino et al.,

2008a)’s conclusion of “dry mantle transition zone” is based on the use of the data from

water-rich samples as “dry” samples and therefore unwarranted.
                                                                                        24

       Also there is an issue on the water content measurements. FTIR (Fourier-

Transform Infrared) spectroscopy and SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) are

most frequently used techniques. For olivine, a significant difference is found between

these methods if (Paterson, 1982) calibration is used (Bell et al., 2003). However such a

discrepancy does not exist for other minerals investigated (Aubaud et al., 2007). In the

following we use the calibration based on SIMS (appropriate corrections have been made

on the results from FTIR measurements).

       In summary, the critical conditions that need to be met for an experimental study

of electrical conductivity are:

   (1) Impedance spectroscopy is used.

   (2) Water content is measured both before and after the conductivity is measured and

       only a small change in water content during the measurements is documented.

   (3) Water content of a “dry” sample is small (smaller than a few wt ppm for a typical

       mantle mineral).

       In the following, when we analyze the experimental results, we choose the results

where all of these conditions are met. In some cases, experimental results that meet all of

these conditions are not available. In these cases, we use the available data with some

notes on potential problems.



EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

       Table 1 summarizes most of the available experimental results on electrical

conductivity of minerals where the influence of water was determined using the

               ⎝ fO 2 ⎠



is used to interpret the results for each mechanism. This equation contains two parameters

characterizing the chemical environment, i.e., fO2 and Cw . This corresponds to the

thermodynamic properties of the system that depend on two factors, fO2 and f H 2O (at a

fixed oxide activity). Note that the activation enthalpy, H * , is for a fixed water

(hydrogen) content. This choice is made because most of experimental studies are made

at a fixed water content, and also the water content in most of Earth’s interior is “fixed”

(i.e., no diffusional exchange of water (closed system behavior)).

       Electrical conductivity for dry (water-free) samples can also be described by this

equation by using r=0. In a more general case, both hydrogen-independent and hydrogen-

dependent mechanisms of conduction operate, and in these cases, contributions from each

must be added. For example, when iron-related and hydrogen-related conduction occurs

simultaneously, one should use

Electronic conduction due to iron-related impurities


        (Schock et al., 1989) conducted a detailed study of electrical conductivity of iron-

bearing, dry (hydrogen-free) olivine where they reported not only the dependence of

conductivity on oxygen fugacity but also they measured the Seebeck coefficient to

demonstrate that charge carrier has positive charge in iron-bearing, hydrogen-free olivine.

Together with point defect analysis (e.g., (Schock and Duba, 1985, Karato, 1973)), these

studies showed that the electrical conduction in iron-bearing minerals such as olivine is

due mostly to electron holes created by ferric iron, and the conductivity increases with

oxygen fugacity as (Fig. 5)

                      *
Karato, 2009c)) and H Fe is the activation enthalpy (~100-150 kJ/mol). The activation

enthalpy depends on either the system is open to the oxidation-reduction reaction or

closed. In most of laboratory experiments, the system is open (i.e., equilibrium with the

surroundings), whereas in Earth system may be closed (see (Karato, 1973)). However,

this effect is relatively small.

        Fig. 6 compares electrical conductivity of hydrogen-free samples at

X Fe = Fe+FeMg =0.1 for fO2 corresponding to the QFM (quartz-fayalite-magnetite) buffer.

When compared at the same Fe content and oxygen fugacity, electrical conductivity of

different minerals shown here is not much different. This means that the electrical

conductivity in iron-bearing minerals is primarily a function of temperature and iron

content.

       The influence of iron content on the electrical conductivity of (nearly) hydrogen-

free olivine was studied by (Cemič et al., 1980). A similar study was conducted on

pyrope-almandine garnet by (Romano et al., 2006). These results are summarized in Fig.

7. In these studies, the water content of the samples was not measured, but judging from

the reported activation energy, we assume that the conduction is mainly due to electron

holes created by ferric iron. The influence of iron content may be interpreted in terms of

the variation in the pre-exponential term or in the activation energy. If we assume its

effect is expressed by the following form,



       σ ∝ exp ( β X Fe )                                                  (18)




we get β ≈ 9 for most of minerals where X Fe = Fe+FeMg (=1-Mg#/100)3 (Fig. 7). A similar

effect is also found for hydrogen-related conduction. Such a relation can be interpreted by

an ionization energy model of activation energy in which the activation energy is

inversely proportional to the dielectric constant (the dielectric constant in minerals

increases with iron content (Cygan and Lasaga, 1986, Shannon et al., 1991)) (e.g.,

(Kittel, 1986)) or a model where activation energy is proportional to the melting

temperature (melting temperature decreases with iron content). The effect of iron is not

respectively.

large in the mantle where the chemical composition is nearly homogeneous. For example,

a variation in iron content of 0.02 (i.e., a change in Mg# of 2) results in the change in

conductivity of a factor of ~20 %. However, the difference in the iron content is large

between the crust and mantle ( ΔX Fe ≈ 0.3-0.5), that results in a factor of ~10 or more

difference in conductivity.

       (Xu et al., 2000) reported results on the experimental studies to determine the

pressure effects on electrical conductivity of iron-bearing olivine with little hydrogen

(again the water content of the samples was not measured but judging from the reported

activation energy, we infer that the conduction is due to electron holes created by ferric

iron). They showed a weak pressure effect (conductivity is reduced by pressure, but only

by a factor of ~2 by a change in pressure of 10 GPa). Expressed in terms of activation

volume, V*=0.6 ± 0.6 cc/mol. (Dai and Karato, 2009b) reported the pressure effects on

conductivity in dry pyrope where conduction is likely due to ferric iron (or electron hole).

The observed pressure effect is similarly modest: pressure reduces conductivity by a

factor of ~10 by 12 GPa. Again in terms of activation volume, the results implies V*=2.5

± 0.5 cc/mol.




Conduction due to hydrogen-related impurities

       The possibility of enhanced conduction by proton was first proposed by (Karato,

1990) motivated by the reported high diffusion coefficient of hydrogen (Mackwell and

Kohlstedt, 1990). This hypothesis was first examined by (Wang et al., 1999) for diopside.

But because natural samples were used in their study, it is not clear if the different

conductivity is due to the different hydrogen content or the concentration of some other
                                                                                        29

impurities. The first definitive test of this model was made by (Huang et al., 2005) for

wadsleyite and ringwoodite, and later for olivine (Wang et al., 2006), for pyrope garnet

(Dai and Karato, 2009b), for orthopyroxene (Dai and Karato, 2009a, Yang et al., 2011a),

and clinopyroxene and plagioclase (Yang et al., 2011a, Yang et al., 2011b). These results

show that, when hydrogen content is high (typically higher than ~10-3 wt% water),

electrical conductivity is higher than those values expected from ferric iron-related

conduction and the activation energy is smaller, and the conductivity increases with

hydrogen (water) content (Fig. 8) as

with r=0.6-1.0 and H *H =70-100 kJ/mol, and in case the oxygen fugacity dependence is

determined, it shows a negative correlation, i.e., qH <0 (Dai and Karato, 2009c).

       These studies essentially support the hypothesis of (Karato, 1990) that hydrogen

enhances electrical conductivity, but in details, these observations do not agree with some

aspects of the simple model by (Karato, 1990). First the activation energy of electrical

conductivity due to hydrogen is considerably smaller (~70-100 kJ/mol) than the

activation energy of hydrogen diffusion (~150 kJ/mol) (e.g., (Hae et al., 2006, Kohlstedt

and Mackwell, 1998)), second the dependence of electrical conductivity on the water

content is not always as expected from the simple model, and third the electrical

conductivity in hydrogen-bearing minerals depends on oxygen fugacity although the

original model predicts no dependence on oxygen fugacity.
                                                                                                  30

       Such deviations from the simple model can be explained by a hybrid model of

hydrogen dissolution (Karato, 2006). In this model, we consider that the hydrogen atoms

dissolved in minerals are present as several different species and the concentrations of

hydrogen with various species is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium (and by

the charge balance). For example, when a majority of hydrogen atoms goes to the M-site

as a neutral defect, ( 2H )M , that defect can be ionized as
                          ×




        ( 2H )×M ⇔ H M′ + H i                                                              (20)

if the mobility of H M

minority defects can be important. There are a few observations that are consistent with

this hybrid model. First, (Nishihara et al., 2008) found that several infrared absorption

peaks of wadsleyite correspond to different hydrogen-defects       ((2H ) , H ′ , H ) .
                                                                         ×
                                                                         M     M

       When ionization of a neutral defect occurs as shown by equation (21), then the

concentrations of charged defects can be calculated as a function of water fugacity using

the law of mass action and appropriate charge balance relationship. It can be shown that

the concentration of H i depends on the water fugacity (and hence the total water content

(we use CW ∝ f H 2O , for olivine and wadsleyite)) as (Karato, 2006),

ringwoodite and q<0 (for wadsleyite) are consistent with a model where much of the

current is carried by free proton H i not by a neutral defect ( 2H )M .
                                                                         ×

Consequently, for the same total water content wadsleyite will have lower electrical

conductivity than olivine. Also this model indicates that the majority of hydrogen-related

defect is the neutral defect, ( 2H )M . The model by (Pearson and Bardeen, 1949, Debye

model to hydrogen conduction in minerals proposed by (Yoshino, 2010) is inappropriate.

and Dai, 2009) showed that the concentration dependence claimed by Yoshino’s group is

an artifact of the experimental technique they used. Also (Yang et al., 2011a, Yang et al.,

2011b) found no dependence of activation energy on water content when impedance

spectroscopy is used, although they found somewhat higher values of r. In fact our

revised calculation for pyrope also shows a similarly larger r (r~1; Table 1). It appears

that minerals where dominant hydrogen-bearing species is ( H ⋅ Al )Si has r~1, but
                                                                            ×

       Fig. 10 compares the electrical conductivity of hydrogen-bearing minerals

including hydrous minerals (for the water content of 0.01 wt%). A comparison is made

for X Fe ≈ 0.1 to minimize the influence of iron content. For hydrous minerals, the

conductivities are shown after normalization to 0.01 wt%, i.e., the conductivity of

hydrous minerals is normalized by σ hyd C0.01           where σ hyd is the conductivity of a

hydrous mineral and Cw,hyd is the water content of the hydrous minerals (in wt%).

Because the densities of these minerals are similar (~3 ± 0.3 g/cm3) and the charge of

proton is common, a comparison of the conductivity after this normalization is essentially

a comparison of the mobility of hydrogen. The results show a systematic trend in

normalized conductivity, i.e., hydrogen mobility. Hydrogen mobility in hydrous minerals

is lower than that in nominally anhydrous minerals. Among nominally anhydrous

minerals, the following trends can also be seen. Nominally anhydrous minerals with high

hydrogen solubility (e.g., wadsleyite and ringwoodite) have low hydrogen mobility that is

consistent with the previous discussion (see Fig. 9). (Schmidbauer et al., 2000) provided
                                                                                           33

clear evidence that electrical conductivity in (Fe-rich) amphibole is caused by ferric iron

rather than proton, a result consistent with our interpretation of low mobility of hydrogen

in this mineral. Also, minerals that have r~1 tend to have higher mobility than those with

r=0.6-0.7. Again this supports the previous discussion that the difference in r may be due

to the different hydrogen mobility.

       (Hier-Majumder et al., 2005) argued that ( 2H )M does not contribute to electrical
                                                         ×



conductivity because it is a neutral defect. This statement is incorrect. ( 2H )M is a neutral

defect relative to the perfect lattice, but does have electric charge relative to the vacuum.

Applied electric field exerts a force on each ion in an ionic crystal that has neutral charge

relative to the prefect lattice but has electric charge relative to the vacuum. This leads to

the well-known phenomena such as dielectric polarization and ionic conduction (see

some textbooks of condensed matter physics, e.g., (Mott and Gurney, 1940, Kittel, 1986,

Kingery et al., 1976)). The inferred small contribution of ( 2H )M is not because it is
                                                                     ×



neutral relative to the perfect crystal but because of its low mobility because hydrogen is

strongly trapped in these defects.

       Fig. 11 summarizes the influence of iron and hydrogen on the electrical

conductivity of typical minerals where electrical conductivity is due either to iron-related

or hydrogen-related defects. Both types of defects have important influence on the

electrical conductivity, but for a typical mantle where peridotite dominates electrical

conduction, the hydrogen effect is more important than the effect of iron because of a

narrow range of iron content. However, when we consider regions where both crustal

component (MORB) and the peridotitic component are present (e.g., the D” layer), then

the influence of iron is also important4.

       The addition of hydrogen will also enhance the electrical conductivity through the

enhancement of diffusion of other ions such as Mg and Fe as discussed by (Karato,

1990). (Hier-Majumder et al., 2005) reported such an effect in olivine. If the

enhancement of diffusion of Mg (Fe) is due to the increased number of ( 2H )M as

where H wet is activation enthalpy. Because the activation enthalpy for this mechanism is

higher than that of hydrogen diffusion mechanism, this effect is important at high

temperatures5. However, because most of the measurements on hydrous minerals were

conducted at low temperatures, this effect was not detected in the previous experimental

studies. The electrical conductivity due to enhanced diffusion of Mg (Fe) can be

calculated from the Nernst-Einstein relation, equation (7), and is ~5 × 10-3 S/m for the

total water content of 10-2 wt% at 1600 K. This is about one order of magnitude smaller

than the electrical conductivity due to proton (~3 × 10-2 S/m). Therefore the influence of

this mechanism is relatively minor in olivine. A similar effect is expected to be present in

  Crustal components (i.e., eclogite) may be present in the main part of the mantle (e.g.,
Sobolev et al., 2007) but its volume fraction is small and its influence is not important in
most of the mantle.

other minerals such as wadsleyite (e.g., (Kubo et al., 2004, Farber et al., 2000)) although

no detailed study was made to quantify such an effect for wadsleyite. When these effects

are included, the influence of hydrogen on electrical conductivity will be higher than the

previous estimates.

       The addition of water (proton) also modifies the electronic structure. Fig. 12

shows the results of calculations of density of states of electrons in forsterite (Mg2SiO4

olivine) (Wang et al., 2011b). Fig. 12a shows the calculated density of states in forsterite

without hydrogen-related defect. Fig. 12b shows the density of state of forsterite where

only a neutral defect ( 2H )M is considered. In this case, the density of states (the band
                             ×



structure) is essentially unchanged from hydrogen-free forsterite. However, when

                          ′ and H i are introduced, a new acceptor level is created
charged defects such as H M

above the edge of the valence band (Fig. 12c). The presence of such an impurity level

enhances electrical conductivity exactly in the same way as ferric iron enhances

conductivity. (Wang et al., 2011a) showed that the impurity level created by the addition

of charged hydrogen-related defect can explain the observed conductivity of hydrous

olivine with a reasonable assumption of the mobility of electrons (or holes). We conclude

that in addition to the direct contribution to conductivity through the migration of free

proton ( H i ), dissolution of hydrogen enhances electronic conduction through the

creation of an impurity level in the band gap. These two mechanisms may have different

conductivity anisotropy.

       Dependence of hydrogen-assisted conductivity on iron content has not been

determined. However, if we use the results of dependence of hydrogen solubility on iron

content (e.g., (Zhao et al., 2004)), then we can predict that the electrical conductivity at a
                                                                                      36

given water fugacity will increase with iron content due to the increase in hydrogen

solubility. In addition, a comparison of the results by (Dai and Karato, 2009a) and (Yang

et al., 2011a) on orthopyroxene with the same hydrogen content but different iron content

shows that the electrical conductivity of hydrogen-bearing orthopyroxene increases with

iron content at the same hydrogen content. This suggests that iron increases the mobility

of hydrogen (or electron hole created by hydrogen defect).



Influence of partial melting


       Melts in general have higher electrical conductivity than minerals. This is

essentially due to the high diffusion coefficients of charged species in melts (e.g.,

(Hofmann, 1980)). Consequently, the presence of partial melt will contribute to high

electrical conductivity.

       The importance of partial melt on electrical conductivity depends on (1) the

conductivity ratio between the melt and the mineral, (2) the volume fraction of melt and

(3) the melt geometry (dihedral angle). (Shankland and Ander, 1983, Shankland and

Waff, 1977) analyzed the influence of partial melting on electrical conductivity in the

asthenosphere and concluded that a large melt fraction (a few %) is needed to enhance

conductivity appreciably. (Gaillard et al., 2008) provided a new data set on carbonatite

melt showing high conductivity, and (Yoshino et al., 2010) measured the electrical

conductivity of olivine + basaltic, olivine + carbonatite melts with equilibrium melt

geometry. These recent studies showed that if more than ~1 % of these melts are present

then the conductivity will be enhanced to be ~10-1 S/m or higher (Fig. 13) (a similar

result was obtained by (Ni et al., 2011) for a hydrous basaltic melt). Although these
                                                                                         37

studies showed somewhat larger effect of partial melt than those by (Shankland and

Ander, 1983, Shankland and Waff, 1977), ~1 % of melt occurs only at the vicinity of

mid-ocean ridges (Plank and Langmuir, 1992, Hirschmann, 2010). In the asthenosphere

far from mid-ocean ridges the melt fraction is ~10-2 % (e.g., (Plank and Langmuir, 1992,

Hirschmann, 2010)) and therefore the influence of partial melting is likely not large in the

asthenosphere away from the oceanic ridges.




SOME APPLICATIONS


Electrical conductivity and the Earth and planetary interiors

       In this section, we will apply experimental results on electrical conductivity and

discuss how the electrical conductivity distribution inferred from geophysical studies may

be interpreted by the composition and/or temperature in Earth and planetary interiors.

Among various parameters, one needs to consider the influence of water, temperature,

major element composition, oxygen fugacity and of partial melting.

       We will calculate the electrical conductivity in various regions of Earth (and other

planets) from laboratory data and a range of temperature, major element chemistry and

water distribution. We assume certain compositional models (e.g., pyrolite for the

mantle), and calculate the mineralogy and element partitioning for each mineral. We will

also assume temperature (pressure) and oxygen fugacity, and calculate electrical

conductivity of each mineral, and then calculate the aggregate conductivity using the

Hashin-Shtrikman average scheme. The contrasts of conductivity among different
                                                                                            38

minerals are modest and therefore the difference between the upper and the lower bounds

of the Hashin-Shtrikman average is not large (less than 50%)6.


Continental mid- and lower crust

       Structure and composition of Earth’s mid- and lower crust are expected to be

laterally heterogeneous (Rudnick and Fountain, 1995, Rudnick et al., 1998). The most

important variables that may affect electrical conductivity are (i) the major element

composition (and mineralogy), (ii) temperature, (iii) the water content, and (iv) the

degree of partial melting.

       The rocks in the continental mid- and lower crust have mafic composition, the

dominant minerals being orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase (+ some hydrous

minerals). Electrical conductivity in the lower crust mineral depends strongly on minerals

(plagioclase has significantly lower conductivity than clino- and orthopyroxene) (Yang et

al., 2011a, Yang et al., 2011b). Also the regional variation in temperature is large (~800-

1300 K). Consequently, it is difficult to interpret the results of conductivity distribution in

the lower crust uniquely. However, the reported conductivities (10-4-10-1 S/m, (Jones,

1992)) can be accounted for by the combination of composition, temperature and water

content. In particular, a detailed review by (Yang, 2011) showed that modestly high

conductivity of the continental lower crust (~10-3 to 10-2 S/m) can be explained by high

Fe (in pyroxenes) and Na (in plagioclase) content (+ high temperature) in addition to the

effects of hydrogen (Fig. 14).




6
  The difference between the upper and the lower bound is large for the lower crust where
the contrast in conductivity among co-existing minerals is large (Yang et al., 2011a).
                                                                                          39

       However, high conductivity on the order of 10-2 to 10-1 S/m observed in certain

regions (e.g., Tibet; (Chen et al., 1996)) is not easy to be attributed to the conduction by

nominally anhydrous minerals. Recently, (Wang et al., 2012) showed that the

dehydration reaction of amphibole enhances electrical conductivity at high temperature

(T>800 K) in amphibolites. This enhancement is not due to the production of aqueous

fluids but due to the change in the oxidation states of iron. This leads to highly

temperature sensitive conductivity, and the high conductivity (10-2 to 10-1 S/m) can be

explained by the modest temperatures (~800-900 K) without invoking partial melting or

the role of aqueous fluids (Fig. 14).



The upper mantle and the transition zone

       In contrast to the lower crust, the distribution of temperature and major element

chemistry in the mantle is rather uniform except for the lithosphere. However, there is

some evidence that the mantle is a mixture of peridotite and eclogite (e.g., (Sobolev et al.,

2007)). These two components have largely different iron content and hence electrical

conductivity. However, the volume fraction of eclogite is small in most regions (~5% for

MORB source regions), so eclogite has little effect on the bulk conductivity, and the

variation in electrical conductivity in the mantle reflects the variation in water content

more directly. However, in some source regions of ocean island basalts, the eclogite

might occupy ~10-20% (Sobolev et al., 2007) and in these regions the high conductivity

of eclogite will have some effects on the bulk conductivity if eclogite bodies are inter-

connected.
                                                                                          40

       Fig. 15 shows models of electrical conductivity in the Earth’s upper mantle and

the transition zone assuming the pyrolite composition. The model is not constructed for

the lower mantle because there is no experimental data to evaluate the influence of

hydrogen on electrical conductivity in lower mantle minerals. In this model, we assumed

a typical adiabatic geotherm (+ small changes due to the latent heat release effect). We

assume the pyrolite composition (homogeneous composition). Even though the bulk

chemistry is assumed to be constant, oxygen fugacity changes with depth due to self-

buffering effect. Oxygen fugacity in Earth’s upper mantle is controlled by a reaction

among skiagite ( Fe32+ Fe23+ Si3O12 garnet), olivine and orthopyroxene (in the garnet

peridotite) and decreases with depth relative to the commonly used buffering reactions

such as QFM (Frost and McCammon, 2008). Consequently, the oxygen fugacity in the

upper mantle decreases significantly with depth (relative to QFM buffer). This has an

important effect on electrical conductivity: it decreases iron-related conduction but it

increases hydrogen-related conduction. Such effects are included in Fig. 15 (such effects

were not considered by (Yoshino, 2010, Baba et al., 2010, Khan and Shankland, 2012)

that results in the systematic error of conductivity of ~one order of magnitude). Similarly,

the partitioning of key elements such as iron and hydrogen among minerals will change

with depth. Particularly important is the depth variation in hydrogen partitioning. We

include this effect using the results by (Irifune and Isshiki, 1998, Bolfan-Casanova, 2005,

Mookherjee and Karato, 2010, Mierdel and Keppler, 2004).

       Because the temperature variation is small and the major element chemistry

changes only a narrow range in the mantle, most of the spatial (depth or lateral) variation

in electrical conductivity can be attributed to the variation in water (hydrogen) content. In
                                                                                       41

our model calculation, we leave the water content as a free parameter and explore a range

of its value from zero (dry) to nearly saturated values. The composition including the

hydrogen content (measured as a total water content) is kept constant with depth. This

corresponds to a model of mantle convection without any large chemical fractionation in

the mantle.

       These results can be compared with geophysically inferred electrical conductivity.

Fig. 16 summarizes the depth and regional variation of electrical conductivity inferred

from the analyses of electromagnetic induction (mostly from (Kelbert et al., 2009), see

also (Khan et al., 2011); for more details, see a Chapter by Schultz). Inversion of these

data is highly non-unique, and in particular, the depth variation in conductivity is only

loosely constrained. If one does not assume any abrupt changes in conductivity with

depth, then one will obtain a smoothly varying conductivity with depth. In some of the

inversions, discontinuities in conductivity are assumed at certain depths motivated by

mineral physics observations and the jump in conductivity is estimated.

       Although uncertainties are large, some robust conclusions can be obtained about

the distribution of electrical conductivity in the Earth’s mantle:

•   Electrical conductivity in the asthenosphere is ~10-2 S/m on average, but locally near

    the top of the asthenosphere conductivity reaches ~10-1 S/m. Electrical conductivity

    of the asthenosphere in the western Pacific is unusually low, ~10-3 S/m.

•   Electrical conductivity in the transition zone is generally higher than that in the

    asthenosphere. On average, it is ~10-1 S/m, but in the south-central Europe, the

    conductivity is low ~10-2-10-1 S/m, whereas in the eastern Asia, conductivity is high

    (~1 S/m).
                                                                                          42

       The electrical conductivity of the asthenosphere can be explained by a modest

amount of water (~10-2 wt%) that is consistent with the geochemical inference (e.g.,

(Dixon et al., 2002, Hirschmann, 2006)) (Fig. 17). The influence of hydrogen will be

somewhat higher (by ~10-20 %) when the effects of enhanced Mg (Fe) diffusion (Hier-

Majumder et al., 2005) are included. There is no need for partial melting to explain this

commonly observed conductivity of the asthenosphere. Most of large lateral variation in

conductivity is likely due to the lateral variation in the water content. Unusually low

electrical conductivity in the western Pacific asthenosphere (Baba et al., 2010) can also

be interpreted by a model by (Karato, 2008b) who proposed that the central-western

Pacific asthenosphere is depleted with water due to the deep partial melting associated

with the Hawaii plume. A high conductivity near the top of the asthenosphere near ridges,

~10-1 S/m (Baba, 2005), may require partial melting, but in most of the asthenosphere

partial melting is not required to explain the inferred electrical conductivity.

       In the transition zone, electrical conductivity is generally higher than that of the

upper mantle. The electrical conductivity in the transition zone cannot be explained by a

dry mantle model. It should be noted that if one assumes constant water content, then

there should be a drop in the electrical conductivity at 410-km (the conductivity in the

transition zone would be smaller than that in the upper mantle) (Fig. 15). Therefore the

increase in the conductivity at 410-km implies an increase in water content.

       The trade-off between water content and temperature for the transition zone is

illustrated in Fig. 18 (a similar trade-off for the upper mantle can be seen in Fig. 17). The

average conductivity of the transition zone (~10-1 S/m) can be explained by ~0.1 wt%

water and temperature of 1700-1900 K. The transition zone in the south-central Europe
                                                                                       43

has a significantly lower conductivity that may partly be attributed to the lower water

content (as well as the lower temperature). Transition zone in the East Asia has higher

conductivity, ~ 1 S/m. The water content of ~1 wt% is needed to explain such a high

conductivity. The inferred regional variation in the water content is consistent with the

tectonic history of these regions: subduction of old and hence cold lithosphere has

occurred for more than ~400 Myrs in the East Asia that likely brought a large amount of

water to the deep mantle (e.g., (Maruyama, 1997, Maruyama and Okamoto, 2007,

Maruyama, 1994)). In contrast, subducting slabs around the Europe are generally young

and hence these slabs dehydrate soon after they subduct. Consequently not much water is

transported to the deep mantle in these regions (Maruyama and Okamoto, 2007).

(Iwamori et al., 2010) presented a similar model of global materials circulation based on

the analysis of chemical compositions of the MORB (mid-ocean-ridge basalt) and OIB

(ocean-island basalt) (see also a Chapter by Iwamori).

       The high conductivity in the transition zone may reflect a large amount of eclogite

(subducted oceanic crust). In these cases, eclogite must be connected, and the regional

variation in conductivity is attributed to the regional variation in the amount and/or the

connectivity of subducted oceanic crust.

       The inferred large contrast in the electrical conductivity between the upper mantle

and the transition zone implies a large contrast in the chemical composition (either the

hydrogen content or the eclogite content or both). In either case, if indeed there is a

layering in chemical composition, there must be some large-scale material segregation in

the middle mantle (at around 410-km). This is due to the fact that without large-scale

material segregation, it is impossible to change the chemical composition of a large
                                                                                          44

region (>100 km) of the mantle because of the slow diffusion. A plausible model is

partial melting at ~410-km (e.g., (Bercovici and Karato, 2003, Karato et al., 2006)) for

which some support has been provided by seismological observations (Tauzin et al.,

2010).

         Recently (Khan and Shankland, 2012) used a sophisticated statistical treatment to

infer the water content in the upper mantle and the transition zone from geophysically

inferred electrical conductivity profiles. They obtained much lower water contents than

those by (Karato, 2011) and (Yoshino et al., 2006). For example, the water content of the

upper mantle that they inferred is far less than the well-constrained value by the

geochemical studies. Their “dry” models predict much higher conductivity than (Karato,

2011), and as a result, most of the observed conductivity in the upper mantle and the

transition can be explained by the “dry” model in their analysis. The reason for this

difference is unclear. One possibility is the difference in the treatment of the influence of

oxygen fugacity. Although the influence of oxygen fugacity is not as large as that of

water, oxygen fugacity can change the conductivity by a factor of ~10 in the deep upper

mantle and transition zone (Karato, 2011). In the lab measurements, oxygen fugacity is

controlled by some solid-state buffers (Ni-NiO etc.). The oxygen fugacity corresponding

to these buffers increases exponentially with pressure (e.g., (Karato, 2008a)). In contrast,

in the upper mantle, the oxygen fugacity is likely controlled by a different buffer and

decreases with depth relative to the solid-state buffers used in the lab studies (Frost and

McCammon, 2008). This leads to the deferent depth dependence of conductivity for

“dry” (Fe-based) conductivity and “wet” (hydrogen-based) conductivity because the

dependence of electrical conductivity on oxygen fugacity is opposite between Fe-based
                                                                                       45

conduction and hydrogen-based conduction (see Fig. 15). (Khan and Shankland, 2012)

did not make corrections for the oxygen fugacity when they applied the lab data to

Earth’s mantle. The large difference in the inferred water content between (Karato, 2011)

and (Khan and Shankland, 2012) is possibly due to the incorrect treatment of the

influence of oxygen fugacity by (Khan and Shankland, 2012). Also important is the

treatment of hydrogen partitioning. As emphasized by (Dai and Karato, 2009a), the

partitioning coefficient is not a constant but depends on the physical (temperature and

pressure) and chemical conditions (water fugacity). This is particularly true for hydrogen

partitioning between olivine and orthopyroxene (Fig. 17). The analysis by (Khan and

Shankland, 2012) does not include such a detail that results in a large difference in the

inferred total water content.



The lower mantle

       Electrical conductivity of the Earth’s lower mantle is also inferred from the

analysis of electromagnetic induction using relatively low frequencies (e.g., (Olsen,

1999)). Even the regional variation in electrical conductivity of the lower mantle was

inferred down to ~1500 km (Kelbert et al., 2009). Also some constraints have been

obtained on the electrical conductivity of the D” layer from the analysis of

electromagnetic coupling of the core and mantle (e.g., (Nagao et al., 2003)).

       The electrical conductivity in the shallow lower mantle is similar to that of the

transition zone. Interpretation of these results in terms of chemical composition is

difficult. (Xu and McCammon, 2002, Xu et al., 1998a) showed that the geophysically

inferred conductivity is consistent with the lab data with a plausible temperature.
                                                                                        46

However, the water content in these samples was not measured and it is impossible to

discuss the water distribution across the 660-km from the available laboratory data.

       (Ohta et al., 2009, Ohta et al., 2010) measured the electrical conductivity down to

the D” conditions and interpreted the inferred conductivity in terms of the major element

composition. They found that the subducted MORB has much higher conductivity than

pyrolite presumably due to the high iron content, and suggested that the inferred high

conductivity in the deep lower mantle may indicate a high volume fraction of subducted

MORB. They also noted an effect of spin transition (transition to low spin state reduces

the conductivity) to reduce electrical conductivity in the mid-lower mantle (~1500-2500

km) (Fig. 19).

       (Dobson and Brodholt, 2000) measured the electrical conductivity of (Mg,Fe)O

and suggested that electronic conduction by ferric iron is likely important. (Yamazaki and

Irifune, 2003) measured the Mg-Fe diffusion coefficients under the lower mantle

conditions. They reported diffusion coefficients of ~10-12-10-13 m2/s under most of the

lower mantle conditions. If the Nernst-Einstein relation is used (equation (7)), these

values are translated to the conductivity of ~10-2-10-1 S/m, somewhat lower than the

conductivity inferred from geophysical studies (e.g., (Olsen, 1999, Kelbert et al., 2009)).

If diffusion of Mg (Fe) in (Mg,Fe)O is enhanced by the addition of hydrogen (e.g.,

(Demouchy et al., 2007); this effect is small at low pressure but this effect should be

higher at higher pressures), the influence of hydrogen may also be important in the

electrical conductivity in the lower mantle. Similar studies should also be conducted on

perovskite, and the influence of hydrogen on the diffusion in (Mg,Fe)O must be

determined at higher pressures.
                                                                                          47




Applications to the Moon and Mars

       Because of the absence of the surface oceans, the electrical conductivity

distribution in the Moon was well-constrained from the analysis of electromagnetic

induction (Sonett et al., 1971, Sonett, 1982, Hood et al., 1982b, Hood et al., 1982a). In

these early studies, the distribution of electrical conductivity was interpreted based on the

experimental data on electrical conductivity of hydrogen-free (dry) samples (Fig. 20).

However, the strong influence of hydrogen on electrical conductivity has recently been

demonstrated as has been reviewed in this article, and the evidence for a substantial

amount of water in the lunar mantle is reported (e.g., (Saal et al., 2008, Greenwood et al.,

2011, Hauri et al., 2011)). Consequently, it is important to reinterpret the lunar

conductivity profile in terms of temperature and water distribution. Because the pressure

conditions in the Moon correspond to the shallow upper mantle in Earth (<4 GPa), the

results shown in Fig. 15 (Fig. 17) can be directly applied to the Moon. One difference is

that the oxygen fugacity in the Moon is likely much lower than that in Earth (e.g.,

(Righter and Drake, 1996)) that reduces conductivity by iron but enhances proton

conductivity (lunar iron content and major mineralogy are similar to Earth, see e.g.,

(Ringwood, 1979, Khan et al., 2007)). The temperatures in the lunar interior inferred

from the seismological and gravity observations (Khan et al., 2007) (see also (Lambeck

and Pullan, 1980)) are considerably lower than those inferred from electrical conductivity

by (Hood et al., 1982a, Hood et al., 1982b) using the dry olivine and orthopyroxene data

(Fig. 20). It is possible that these differences are caused by the presence of water in the

deep lunar interior.
                                                                                       48

       Similarly some preliminary studies have been published on the distribution of

electrical conductivity in Mars (e.g., (Verhoeven et al., 2005)). Martian mantle

corresponds to the upper mantle and the transition zone of Earth, and therefore nearly

complete data set on electrical conductivity is available. For Mars, the influence of high

iron content needs to be included. Results on orthopyroxene summarized above suggest

that high iron content enhances hydrogen-related conductivity as well as iron-related

conductivity, but the exact amount of enhanced conductivity is unknown. More important

is the influence of hydrogen. However, the influence of water on electrical conductivity

was not included in the previous studies. Water content in Martian mantle is controversial

(e.g., (Greenwood et al., 2008, Elkins-Tanton, 2008, Guest and Smrekar, 2007, Dreibus

and Wänke, 1985, Breuer and Spohn, 2006)). Once the data set on the electrical

conductivity in Mars becomes available, a comparison to the experimental data will

provide strong constraints on the hydrogen distribution in Mars that will help us

understand the evolution of this planet.



SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES

       In the geophysical literature, high electrical conductivity (and low seismic wave

velocities) was often attributed to the presence of some fluids including melts and

aqueous fluids (Shankland et al., 1981, Jones, 1992). During the last several years, there

have been extensive studies on the electrical conductivity of minerals with the focus on

the influence of hydrogen, and a majority of observed high conductivity can be explained

by the solid-state mechanisms involving hydrogen. After reviewing key experimental

details, we conclude that if results from properly executed experimental studies are used,
                                                                                        49

the proposal by (Karato, 1990) of hydrogen-enhanced conductivity is now well supported

for the lower crust, upper mantle and transition zone minerals. In most of Earth’s interior

(lower crust, upper mantle and transition zone), electrical conductivity is dominated by

hydrogen. However, the original idea by (Karato, 1990) needs to be modified. In many

cases, the enhancement of electrical conductivity by hydrogen is not the direct effect of

all the dissolved hydrogen. Not all hydrogen atoms in a mineral have high mobility. The

mobility of hydrogen is different among various minerals. A hybrid model is needed to

explain the experimental results in which the role of minor hydrogen-bearing defects is

emphasized. In addition to ionic defects, electronic defects created by hydrogen-related

defects may play an important role. Also, dehydration of hydrous minerals (in the mid- or

lower crust) enhances conductivity through the change in the oxidation state of iron.

       Some differences were noted between the experimental results from Yoshino’s

group (for a review see (Yoshino, 2010)) and Karato’s group ((Karato, 2011) and a

summary presented here). Reasons for these differences were discussed in the previous

papers (see e.g., (Karato, 2011, Karato and Dai, 2009)) but reiterated in this paper. Most

of our conclusions are also supported by the studies by (Yang et al., 2011a, Yang et al.,

2011b) who use the impedance spectroscopy and determine the water content through the

careful FTIR spectroscopy (their “dry” samples contain very few water <10 ppm wt). The

basic features of the results from Yang’s group and those from the Karato’s group agree

well. In addition to the use of inappropriate, single low frequency in many studies by

Yoshino’s group, the most serious problem in the studies by the Yoshino’s group is the

poor characterization of water content in their “dry” samples. The main conclusions from

their studies such as “hydrous olivine unable to account for conductivity anomaly at the
                                                                                        50

top of the asthenosphere” (Yoshino et al., 2006) and “dry mantle transition zone inferred

from the conductivity of wadsleyite and ringwoodite” (Yoshino et al., 2008a) are the

results of these inappropriate methods used in their studies and are not supported by the

well-executed experimental studies. Also there is a major difference in the inferred water

content from electrical conductivity by (Khan and Shankland, 2012) and (Karato, 2011).

(Khan and Shankland, 2012) calculated much higher conductivity of “dry” mantle than

(Karato, 2011) (and than (Yoshino et al., 2006) in case of the upper mantle), that leads to

the inferred lower hydrogen contents. The water content of the upper mantle inferred by

(Khan and Shankland, 2012) is far less than the value inferred by the geochemical

method (the water content of the upper mantle inferred by (Karato, 2011, Dai and Karato,

2009a) agrees with the geochemical estimate). The exact cause of this discrepancy is

unclear, but (Khan and Shankland, 2012) did not take into account of the influence of

oxygen fugacity, and they did not consider the influence of hydrogen partitioning

properly that can lead to a systematic difference in the inferred water content.

       The major remaining issue is the influence of hydrogen on the electrical

conductivity of the lower mantle minerals. The lower mantle occupies the largest portion

of the Earth’s mantle, but currently we have no constraints on the water content in this

region from electrical conductivity. Because the dominant point defects in the lower

mantle minerals are ferric iron and related defects (McCammon, 1997), and because

oxygen diffusion is fast in perovskite (Dobson, 2003), it is not clear if hydrogen enhances

electrical conductivity in the lower mantle minerals. Experimental and theoretical studies

on the influence of hydrogen on the electrical conductivity in lower mantle minerals are

critical to understand the water distribution in the whole Earth.

Fig. 2           A comparison of the results on electrical conductivity measurements on

olivine


Results for “pure” Mg2SiO4, San Carlos olivine (without hydrogen), San Carlos olivine

with hydrogen (0.01 wt%) are compared (forsterite: (Schock et al., 1989), San Carlos

olivine: (Constable, 2006), wet olivine: (Wang et al., 2006)). Results on single crystals

are averaged to compare with results for polycrystals.


Fig. 3           The Cole-Cole plot of impedance of a sample + electrode where ( Z ′, Z ′′ )

are plotted


   (a) The sample + electrode system is modeled as a parallel combination of a resister

          and a capacitor. In order to obtain the resistance, the data for a broad frequency

          range must be analyzed using a model. If one frequency is chosen (shown by a

          black dot) and resistivity is determined by this through Z ′ = R , then the inferred

          resistivity (conductivity) has systematic error because the correction for the

          capacitance is not made (the correct expression is Z ′ =            R
                                                                                       ).   Such a
                                                                         1+ω 2 R 2 C 2


          correction is not important when conduction is due to electrons (or holes) (small
                                                                                                62

         C) but such a correction is important when conduction is due to ionic species such

         as hydrogen.

   (b) A case where two sequential conduction mechanisms are present


         In this case, there will be two half circles, and the high-frequency one usually

         corresponds to the electrical conduction in grain interior.


   (c) A case where the capacitance has distributed response

         Under some conditions, distributed capacitance can be represented by replacing

         iω RC with ( iω RC )
                                 1−α
                                        (Cole and Cole, 1941, Roberts and Tyburczy, 1991,

         Huebner and Dillenburg, 1995). The element that has Z = R ( iω RC )
                                                                                      −α
                                                                                           is often

         called CPE (constant phase element) because it represents a phase angle between

         Z ′ and Z ′′ that is independent of frequency. The impedance for such a circuit is

         given by Z =          R
                                    α   ( 0 ≤ α < 1 ). In this case, the half circle is distorted.
                        1+ ( iω RC )


         However, one can still determine the resistance (1/conductivity) from the

         intercept with the Z’ axis (Z’=R at ω = 0 ).


Fig. 4          A schematic drawing showing a curvature in the log σ ⇔ 1 / T plot when

two independent conduction mechanisms are present


         In these cases, extrapolation from the low-temperature regime assuming a linear

relation will underestimate the true conductivity at mantle temperatures.

         Electrical conductivity in iron-bearing olivine increases with oxygen fugacity,

whereas electrical conductivity of “pure” forsterite (Mg2SiO4) shows a more complex

oxygen fugacity dependence. Results at 0.1 MPa and T=1473 K.

measured but based on the activation energy, we infer that the conduction is due to iron-

related defects), orthopyroxene (Dai and Karato, 2009a), wadsleyite (Dai and Karato,

Fig. 9          A model of hydrogen-related defects in a nominally anhydrous mineral


   (a) A majority of hydrogen-related defects in mantle minerals is a neutral defect such

         as ( 2H )M (two protons at M-site vacancy). However, some fraction of these
                 ×



         neutral defects are ionized to form charged defects by a reaction
                                                                                               64


          ( 2H )×M ⇔ H M′ + H i ( H M′ : one hydrogen trapped at M-site vacancy, H i : “free”
          proton)


   (b) The energy levels of hydrogen-related defects


          At equilibrium the concentrations of these charged defects are controlled by the

          thermo-chemical equilibrium of the above reaction as well as the conditions of

          charge balance. The presence of these three defects was inferred for wadsleyite

          (Nishihara et al., 2008). Even if the concentrations of these defects are smaller

          than that of a neutral defect, the minority charged defects could control electrical

          conductivity if the product of mobility and concentration is high. ΔE1,2 is the

          energy difference between different defects relative to the neutral defect ( 2H )M .

Fig. 10             Electrical conductivity of hydrogen-bearing minerals normalized to 0.01

wt% of water (thin solid lines are nominally anhydrous minerals with r~0.6-0.7, broken

lines are nominally anhydrous minerals with r~1 and thick solid lines are hydrous

minerals (results for hydrous minerals are under the conditions where they are stable.

When dehydration occurs, conductivity will change (see Fig.14)) (data from samples

with XFe~0.1 are chosen (when the iron content is different from XFe~0.1, corrections are

made using the relation (18))


          When normalized, conductivity of hydrous minerals is generally lower than that

          in nominally anhydrous minerals showing that the mobility of hydrogen in

          hydrous minerals is less than that in nominally anhydrous minerals. In these

          minerals, electrical conduction likely occurs by some other impurities such as
                                                                                                    65

          iron-related mechanisms (therefore their conductivity varies largely among

          different minerals). Also the normalized conductivity of minerals with r~1 is

          generally higher than that of minerals with r~0.6-0.7.


          Data are from Table 1 for nominally anhydrous minerals and for hydrous

          minerals data are from (Reynard et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2001, Schmidbauer et al.,

          2000). Modest anisotropy is reported for talc (Guo et al., 2011). We used the

          average values.

          An impurity level is created in the band gap close to the edge of the valence band

          (an acceptor level) similar to the case of ferric iron-bearing olivine.




          Electrons occupy various states from the lowest energy level to the maximum

level that is determined by the total number of electrons. The maximum energy is defined

to be zero energy (E=0 eV). Therefore, at the ground state, all electrons belong to the

fully occupied energy bands and they are immobile. Electrical conduction occurs only

when some electrons are moved to a higher energy level by thermal activation. Such

activation is facilitated when an impurity level is created in the band gap.

          Hatched regions correspond to a range of conductivity of the continental lower

crust inferred from geophysical studies. This lines with “hydrous” corresponds to

minerals containing ~0.04 wt% water, “Dry” correspond to water-free samples. HS +,−

for amphibolites. Above ~800 K, conductivity of amphibolite increases strongly with

temperature due to oxidation of iron caused by dehydration.

transition zone (from (Karato, 2011)) for various fixed water (hydrogen) content


          (a) The assumed geotherm. (b) The calculated conductivity-depth profiles.


          The depth variation in the oxygen fugacity is included in the calculation based on

          the model by (Frost and McCammon, 2008). Water content is assumed to be

          constant with depth.


          Thick broken lines in the transition zone are the results by (Yoshino, 2010) based

          on the incorrect method of conductivity measurements (see text for details) and

          their “dry” samples contain ~0.01-0.1 wt% of water.

transition zone determined from the analysis of electromagnetic induction (after (Karato,

          The thick lines show “average” conductivity and the grey regions show the range

of conductivity in various regions.

For the plausible temperature (~1600 K), the water content of ~10-2 wt% is consistent

with most of the geophysical observations on the asthenosphere (with some regional

variations). The enhanced Mg (Fe) diffusion (Hier-Majumder et al., 2005) will increase

the influence of water but its effect is small (~10%) (see text).


Fig. 18           The trade-off between water effect and temperature effect on the electrical

conductivity of the upper transition zone


Both iron-related conduction and hydrogen-related conduction are considered. A mixture

of 60 % wadsleyite and 40% majorite is assumed. The hatched regions show typical

temperature and conductivity values in the upper transition zone. For a conductivity of

~10-1 S/m (see Fig. 16), the water content of ~0.1 wt% is inferred.


Fig. 19           Electrical conductivity-depth profiles in the lower mantle (Ohta et al.,

2010)


          The low conductivity in the middle lower mantle is due to low-spin state of

perovskite (and (Mg,Fe)O). Conductivity of MORB is generally higher than that of

pyrolite.

          The temperature-depth model shown here is based on the electrical conductivity

of dry (water-free) olivine and orthopyroxene. If the influence of water is included, the

inferred temperature will be reduced. A grey region shows the temperature-depth profile

fugacity (such as NNO that is shown in the “remarks” in the Table), Cw is the water content in wt %, H* is activation enthalpy, R is the gas constant and T is temperature. When
these results are to be applied to other oxygen fugacity conditions, a correction needs to be made using the above formula. The oxygen fugacity exponent, q, was determined for
some minerals. qd =0.17 for dry conditions and qw =-0.1 for wet conditions.
The correction for pressure effect is not large in most cases (because conductivity was measured near the relevant pressure in most cases).

    Yoshino et al. (2009) used σ = A ⋅ Cw ⋅ exp ⎜ −              ⎟ , which is not an appropriate formula as discussed in the text.

     The sample has 0.042 wt% water. The electrical conductivity for wet opx is fitted to σ = A ⋅ exp ⎜ −  ⎟.

****
       : The values of A for wet samples of olivine depend on the water content measurement for which different calibrations for FT-IR measurement give a factor of ~3 difference in
water content. Such a difference does not exist (or is not known) for other minerals listed here.
