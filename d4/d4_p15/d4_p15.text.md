                                  Piezoelectric materials are significantly affected in their mechanical and electrical properties due to
                                  the presence of internal cracks (especially rectangular cracks), which in turn impacts the reliability and
                                  functionality of the devices.This paper investigates the problem of rectangular cracks in piezoelectric
                                  materials through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. First, the electromechanical coupling
                                  governing equations and constitutive relationships of piezoelectric materials are established to
                                  analyze the stress field and electric displacement field at the crack tip, providing a theoretical basis
                                  for crack propagation behavior. Subsequently, the finite element method is employed to simulate the
                                  electromechanical coupling characteristics of rectangular cracks, revealing the variation patterns of
                                  stress, displacement, and potential contour plots under mechanical and electromechanical loading for
                                  different piezoelectric materials. Finally, The random forest machine learning and response surface
                                  method are used for the first time to study rectangular cracks in piezoelectric materials.A random
                                  forest regression model is applied to predict the data, and from the residual scatter plot provided,
                                  the accuracy of the prediction model is found to be high. Moreover, response surface methodology is
                                  used to analyze the influence of crack length, mechanical load, and electric field on crack propagation,
                                  offering an optimal model design scheme.

                                  In recent years, the research of piezoelectric materials has focused on improving their performance, multi-
                                  functionalization and sustainability. It is used not only in sensors and actuators, but also in energy harvesting1–3,
                                  smart surfaces4,5, haptic electronics6, and medical devices7–9. Compared with traditional two-dimensional
                                  materials, three-dimensional piezoelectric materials10–12 have continuously promoted the development of new
                                  applications in terms of material innovation13,14, manufacturing technology15 and functional expansion16,
                                  providing many solutions for intelligent17, customized18 and sustainable requirements19.
                                      These materials may be subjected to complex mechanical loads and electric fields in practical applications,
                                  resulting in the formation and propagation of cracks, which will affect their reliability and performance. Cracks
                                  in piezoelectric materials have been analyzed and discussed by many researchers. Lei20 studied the effects of
                                  loading conditions, anisotropic fracture toughness and the interaction between cracks on the crack growth path.
                                  The accuracy and effectiveness of the program for the numerical simulation of crack propagation of piezoelectric
                                  materials are verified by comparing with the results of finite element calculation. The interaction of semi-infinite
                                  crack/finite crack with multiple loads in two-dimensional piezoelectric quasicrystals under different boundary
                                  conditions is studied. Using Stroh form and conformal mapping, Green’s functions of generalized displacement
                                  and stress for semi-infinite crack and finite crack under free-free or fixed–fixed boundary conditions are
                                  obtained. The stress and electric displacement intensity factors of the crack tip are obtained21. Gilbert22 studied
                                  the anti-plane reinforcement crack propagation of PZT type piezoelectric materials. By using the numerical
                                  results and the graph representation of the incremental strain energy density, the initiation direction of the
                                  anti-plane reinforcement crack under different stiffness constants and different initial electric field values can be
                                  predicted. The electromechanical interaction integrals of several crack patterns were modified and realized, and
                                  the accuracy under Maxwell stress was verified, and the influence factors of class normalized SIF were given23.
                                      The previous studies mainly focus on the two-dimensional crack problem in piezoelectric materials. The
                                  key parameters of crack tip field distribution, electric field intensity factor and energy release rate are discussed
                                  by analytical method and numerical simulation. With the deepening of the research, the problem of three-
                                  dimensional crack has been paid more and more attention. The existence of three-dimensional crack makes the
                                  distribution of crack tip field more complicated, which has a significant effect on the electric field and mechanical

                                  field response of the material. By using the boundary integral equation method of extended displacement
                                  discontinuity, plane cracks in three-dimensional transvertical isotropic thermal PSC are analyzed24.The crack
                                  problem of piezoelectric materials is analyzed not only by using a simple full electric permeation model, but
                                  also by using a physically real semi-permeation model. Throughout the analysis, the influence of crack surface
                                  contact is taken into account to rule out physically unrealistic interpenetration of composite components in the
                                  typical classical open model25,26.
                                       Although the two-dimensional crack problem has been studied extensively, the applicability of the results to
                                  the three-dimensional complex crack problem is limited. Rectangular cracks pose new challenges due to their
                                  geometric complexity and multi-dimensional coupling effect of tip fields. It is of great theoretical value and
                                  practical significance to study rectangular cracks in three-dimensional piezoelectric materials. On the one hand,
                                  it is helpful to deeply understand the complex fracture behavior under electro-mechanical coupling conditions,
                                  and improve the fracture mechanics theory of piezoelectric materials. On the other hand, it provides important
                                  support for the structural design, performance optimization and life management of devices in engineering
                                  applications. Therefore, the systematic study of three-dimensional rectangular cracks is an important direction
                                  in the field of fracture mechanics of piezoelectric materials.

                                  Because the fracture behavior is the original displacement continuous body, the interface is separated under
                                  the action of load. In order to make reasonable use of the fracture behavior of the material and reduce the
                                  unnecessary fracture risk of the molding process, the finite element simulation can provide a strong guarantee.
                                  Finite element analysis is the use of mathematical approximation method to simulate the real physical system
                                  (geometry and load conditions), the use of simple and interacting elements, that is, the unit, to approximate the
                                  finite number of unknowns to the infinite real system. As a finite element simulation software, ABAQUS not
                                  only includes a rich library of elements that can simulate any geometric shape, but also has a library of various
                                  types of material models, which can simulate many problems in the field of engineering such as piezoelectric
                                  dielectric analysis, thermoelectric coupling analysis, acoustic analysis, stress coupling analysis, etc. It adopts the
                                  parametric modeling method and sets the interaction module separately, which can accurately simulate a variety
                                  of contact problems existing in practical engineering, thus providing a strong guarantee for parameter design
                                  and optimization and structural modification of practical engineering structures.
                                      In this paper, a piezoelectric material plate with a central rectangular crack length and width is simulated,
                                  subjected to tensile stress and potential action, and the size is unit length. Because the piezoelectric material plate
                                  studied is symmetrical, a plane (right half plane model) is selected here for better research and more intuitive
                                  analysis of crack propagation. When building a numerical model, it is necessary to build geometric components
                                  first. Here, the parts of the plate are selected as three-dimensional entities, and the cracked parts are selected as
                                  three-dimensional shells. When defining materials, coordinate transformation of material parameters is carried
                                  out according to polarization direction, and the orthotropic type is selected to define elastic and dielectric
                                  behavior of materials, and at the same time define piezoelectric behavior of materials. The cross-section of the
                                  plate is selected for solid uniformity, and the direction of polarization is specified.The specific steps are shown
                                  in Fig. 2 as follows:

                                  Numerical simulation of cracks under different force loads
                                  In order to ensure the accuracy of the calculation results, a three-dimensional model was adopted in the
                                  simulation. The size of the simulated three-dimensional piezoelectric material was unit length, the size of
                                  the central rectangular crack was unit length, and the material was PZT-4. According to the symmetry of the
                                  problem, a plane (right half plane model) was selected for study.
                                      It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the crack tip is the place where the stress is greatest, which is consistent with
                                  the actual situation, which is mainly caused by the stress concentration at the crack tip. As shown in Figs. 4–5,
                                  the size distribution trend of different displacement vectors under tensile stress can be seen according to color.
                                  Meanwhile, the detailed positions of maximum and minimum values can be found from the figure. Under the
                                  action of tensile stress, the piezoelectric ceramics produce a change of electric potential, an obvious stratification
                                  phenomenon, and an electric potential difference.
                                      Three-dimensional piezoelectric material PZT-4, the size is unit length, the size of the central rectangular
                                  crack is unit length, select the plane (right half plane model) to study, the left and front cloud images under
                                  tensile stress are shown in Figs. 6,7,8.

                                  vector and electric potential all show different changes, and within a certain range, with the increase of load, the
                                  maximum values of crack tip stress and electric potential tend to increase. Moreover, it can be seen that even if
                                  the applied electric displacement load is zero, the crack tip stress and electric potential all increase. The potential
                                  of the crack tip is not zero, which indicates that the stress load can generate the potential at the crack tip, that is,
                                  the potential generation will be affected by the stress load.

                                  was PZT-5H. The plane (right half plane model) was selected for study. The cloud images of the left side and front
                                  side under tensile stress and 2000 V/m were shown in Figs. 18,19. Figures 20,21 shows the left and front cloud
                                  images under tensile stress and -2000 V/m.
                                      It can be seen from the figure that (1) the change of force load will not only affect the size of the crack tip
                                  stress, but also have a great impact on the size of the surrounding area; (2) Although the piezoelectric properties
                                  of PZT-4 and PZT-5H are different, within a certain range, the stress value near the crack tip will increase with
                                  the increase of force load, and the stress value near the crack tip will decrease with the decrease of force load;
                                  (3) The maximum stress value is located at a distance near the crack edge, and the crack tip is very close to the
                                  maximum stress value point, which is closely related to the size of the rectangular crack, and the damage near the
                                  crack tip is much larger than that in other areas, and gradually becomes smaller and smaller toward the position
                                  of the rectangular crack Angle, which is consistent with the analytical results of the theoretical solution.
                                      For the PZT-5H material plate, under the same load, the force and displacement of the crack tip will be
                                  affected by the applied electric field after the voltage is applied. Under the force load, the displacement vector
                                  values and crack tip values under the action of positive and negative electric fields are different from those under
                                  the action of only 5 MPa force load, which means that the positive and negative electric fields will affect the crack
                                  propagation. Can promote or hinder crack propagation. However, it can be seen from the values in the figure
                                  that the influence of force load on crack growth is greater, and the influence of 2000v/m and -2000v/m on crack
                                  growth is relatively small.

                                  To conduct a more in-depth analysis of crack propagation and material failure mechanisms, based on
                                  electromechanical coupling equations and numerical simulations, Random Forest was employed for regression
                                  analysis and classification modeling of stress and displacement values. Predictions were performed on the test
                                  set based on the selected important features, and residual analysis scatter plots (as shown in Figs. 22,23,24) were
                                  generated to illustrate the differences between the true values and the predicted values. Taking F1, U1, and U3

                                  statistically that these factors have a very significant effect on the response variables.

                                  the developed prediction model is practical and accurate. This is important because it means that the model

                                  behavior. The response surface plot is obtained through numerical method data, illustrating how crack length
                                  and force load influence the stress field and displacement field at the crack tip. The stress field and displacement
                                  field are typically represented by color. By observing the distribution of the stress field and displacement field,
                                  one can understand the stress concentration at the crack tip and the changes in the stress field and displacement
                                  field under different crack lengths and force load. Additionally, the analysis results of the response surface plot
                                  can be applied to practical engineering issues, such as crack detection, prediction of crack propagation, and
                                  assessment of structural integrity.

                                      Based on the experimental results and the fitting model, with the mechanical performance of the rectangular
                                  crack propagation in piezoelectric materials as the target, when S is selected as the target, it is found that the
                                  stress value reaches 2.40801E + 07 when the crack length is 20 mm, the force load is 10 MPa, and the electric
                                  field is 4000v/m. When U1 is selected as the target, the U1 value reaches 7.244E-07 when the crack length is
                                  20 mm, the force load is 10 MPa, and the electric field is 4000v/m. When U3 is selected as the target, the U3
                                  value reaches -2.05785E-07 when the crack length is 20 mm and the force load is 10 MPa, but with an electric
                                  field of -4000v/m.

                                  Conclusion
                                  The expressions of stress field and electric displacement field at the crack tip were obtained by theoretical analysis
                                  and numerical simulation. The variation laws of stress, displacement and electric potential of different materials
                                  under force load and electric load were given by numerical simulation. It can be found that (1) the change
                                  of force load will not only affect the size of the crack tip stress, but also have a great impact on the size of the
                                  surrounding area; (2) Although the piezoelectric properties of PZT-4 and PZT-5H are different, within a certain
                                  range, the stress value near the crack tip will increase with the increase of force load, and the stress value near
                                  the crack tip will decrease with the decrease of force load; (3) The maximum stress value is located at a distance
                                  near the crack edge, and the crack tip is very close to the maximum stress value point, which is closely related to
                                  the size of the rectangular crack, and the damage near the crack tip is much larger than that in other areas, and
                                  gradually becomes smaller and smaller toward the position of the rectangular crack Angle, which is consistent
                                  with the analytical results of the theoretical solution; (4)The size of the damage area near the crack tip caused by
                                  different force loads is different, and the corresponding value can be used to further predict whether the material
                                  will be damaged. (5) The innovation of this paper is that the random forest regression model and response
                                  surface method are applied to the analysis of rectangular cracks in piezoelectric materials for the first time, and
                                  a good prediction model is obtained, which provides a strong guarantee for the study of crack propagation and
                                  reliability analysis.
                                      Future research can focus on the following two aspects: (1). The performance of piezoelectric materials is
                                  influenced by material parameters such as piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric constant, and elastic constants.
                                  Future studies can investigate how these parameters affect the electromechanical behavior of cracks. (2). Current
                                  simulations may be based on macroscopic scales. Future research can consider the use of multi-scale simulations,
                                  combining the effects of crack tip dielectric polarization at the microscale, to more accurately predict crack
                                  behavior.
