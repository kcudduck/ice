independently, not taking into account the point of merging of these two bathymetries. Numerically, we solve the nonlinear
shallow water equations.
The paper 1s organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the main formulas and briefly describe the analytical solution. The
numerical model 1s described and validated in Section 3. The nonlinear deformation and run-up of the long single wave of
positive polarity 1s described in Section 4. The main results are summarized in Section J.
2. Analytical solution
We solve the nonlinear shallow water equations for the bathymetry shown in Fig. 1:
ou ou on
—+u—+g—=0, (1)
ot Ox 8 Ox
on oO
—+—|(A(x)+n)u |=0. (2)
~ += [(h+m)u]
Here n(x, t) 1s the vertical displacement of the water surface with respect to the still water level, u(x,r) — depth-averaged
water flow, h(x) — unperturbed water depth, g 1s the gravitational acceleration, x 1s the coordinate directed onshore, and 7 1s
time. The system of Egs.(1),(2) 1s solved independently for the two bathymetries shown in Fig. 1: a basin of constant depth
ho and length Xo and a plane beach, where the water depth h(x) = - x tance.
Egs. (1),(2) can be solved exactly for a few specific cases. In the case of constant depth, the solution 1s described by the
Riemann wave (Stoker 1957). Its adaptation for the boundary problem can be found in Zahibo et al. (2008). In the case of a
plane beach, the corresponding solution was found by Carrier and Greenspan (1958). Both solutions are well-known and
widely used and we do not reproduce them here, but just provide some key formulas.
As already mentioned, during its propagation along the basin of constant depth /o, the wave transforms as a Riemann wave
(Zahibo et al. 2008):
x+X,+L
x,t)=n,|t————1, 3
V(x,1)=3g| hy +1(x,1) | -2{/gh, : (4)
where 77,(x =—L—X,t) is the water displacement at the left boundary. After the propagation over the section of constant
depth ho, the incident wave has the following shape:
X 0
Myo (1) = 1, TV (x) ; Vio (1) =3yJg| ly +7150 (1) | = 2 8h, : (5)
