Figure 9: Wave evolution at different locations x/4 =0, 0.85, 1.71, 2.56, 3.41, 4.27 and 5.12 along the section of
constant depth for a basin with X¢/Z =5.12 and tan a = 1:20. Numerical results are shown by solid lines, while the
analytical predictions are given by the black dotted lines. The parameters of the wave: A/ho = 0.03, kho = 0.19.

Figure 10: The ratio of maximum run-up height in the conjoined basin, Rmax/A and the maximum run-up height on a
plane beach, Ro/A versus the wave front steepness, s/so for A/ho = 0.057, kho = 0.38 (brown points), A/ho = 0.086,
kho = 0.38 (red plus signs), A/ho = 0.057, kho = 0.29 (blue points), A/ho = 0.086, kho = 0.29 (turquoise plus signs),
A/ho = 0.057, kho = 0.22 (violet points), A/ho = 0.086, kho = 0.22 (pink plus signs), A/ho = 0.057, kho = 0.19 (dark green
points), A/ho = 0.086, kho=0.19 (light green plus signs). All markers correspond to the results of numerical
simulations, while the asymptotic analytical predictions are given by the red solid line. Black dashed line corresponds
to the power fit of the analytical results Eq. (16).
The results of numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 10 with different markers. It can be seen that numerical data for the
same period, but different amplitudes follow the same curve. The run-up 1s higher for waves with smaller kA. In our opinion,
