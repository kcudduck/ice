reconstruction in space and the third order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps. The model 1s validated
against experimental data.
The main conclusions of the paper are the following.

e Found analytically, that maximum tsunami run-up height on a beach depends on the wave front steepness at the toe
of the bottom slope. This dependence 1s general for single waves of different amplitudes and periods and can be
approximated by the power fit: R__/R, = (s ls, ) :

e This dependence is slightly weaker than the corresponding dependence for a sine wave, proportional to the square
root of the wave front steepness (Didenkulova et al. 2007). The stronger dependence of a sine wave run-up on the
wave front steepness 1s consistent with the philosophy of N-waves (Tadepalli and Synolakis 1994).

e Numerical simulations in general support this analytical finding. For smaller face front wave steepness (s/so < 1.5)
numerical curves of maximum tsunami run-up height are parallel to the analytical one, while for larger face front
wave steepness (s/so > 1.5), this dependence 1s milder. The latter may be a result of numerical dissipation (error),
which 1s larger for a longer wave propagation and, consequently, larger wave steepness. The suggested formula,
which gives the best fit with the data of numerical simulations in general is R_ /R, =1.17(4/ L)" (s/s, ) :

e These results can also be used 1n tsunami forecast. Sometimes, in order to save time for tsunami forecast, especially
for long distance wave propagation, the tsunami run-up height 1s not simulated directly, but estimated using
analytical or empirical formulas (Glimsdal et al. 2019; Levholt et al. 2012). In these cases we recommend using
formulas, which take into account the face front wave steepness. The face front steepness of the approaching
tsunami wave can be estimated from the data of the virtual (computed) or real tide-gauge stations and then be used
to estimate tsunami maximum run-up height on a beach.

The nonlinear shallow water equations which are used in this study and commonly utilized for tsunami modelling, are also
known as to neglect dispersive effects. In this context, it 1s important to mention the recent work of Larsen and Fuhrman
(2019). They used RANS equations and k-w model for turbulence closure to simulate propagation and run-up of positive
single waves, including full resolution of dispersive short waves (and their breaking) that can develop near a positive
tsunami front. They similarly showed that this effect depends on the propagation distance prior to the slope, if a simple toe
with a slope type of bathymetry 1s utilized. This work shows that these short waves have little effect on the overall run-up,
and hence give additional credence to the use of shallow water equations. These results largely confirm what was previously
hypothesized by Madsen et al. (2008), that these short waves would have little effect on the overall run-up and inundation of
tsunamis (though they found that they could significantly increase the maximum flow velocities).
