where A 1s the input wave height and 7 1s the effective wave period at the location with the water depth ho. The wave
described by Eq. (9) has an arbitrary height and period and, therefore, does not satisfy properties of the soliton, but just has a
sech? shape. Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (8), we can calculate the complex spectrum B(w).

This solution we also compare with the run-up of a single wave of positive polarity described by Eq. (9) (without nonlinear
deformation). The maximum run-up height Rn.x of such wave (9) can be found from (Didenkulova et al. 2008; Sriram et al.

If the initial wave 1s soliton, Eq. (14) coincides with the famous Synolakis formula (Synolakis, 1987).
3. Numerical model
Numerically, we solve the nonlinear shallow water equations Eqs. (1),(2) written in a conservative form for a total water
depth. We include the effect of the varying bathymetry (in space) and neglect all friction effects. However, the resulting
numerical model will take into account for some dissipation thanks to the numerical scheme dissipation, which 1s necessary
for the stability of the scheme and should not influence much run-up characteristics. Namely, we employ the natural
numerical method, which was developed especially for conservation laws - the finite volume schemes.
The numerical scheme 1s based on the second order in space UNO2 reconstruction, which 1s briefly described in (Dutykh et
al. 2011b). In time we employ the third order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps in order to satisfy the
CFL stability condition. The numerical technique to simulate the wave run-up was described previously in (Dutykh et al.
