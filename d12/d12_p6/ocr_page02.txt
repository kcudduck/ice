The general solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations on a plane beach was found by Carrier and Greenspan (1958)
using the hodograph transformation. Later on many other authors found specific solutions for different types of waves
climbing the beach, see, for instance, (Pedersen and Gjevik 1983; Synolakis 1987; Synolakis et al. 1988; Mazova et al. 1991;
Pelinovsky and Mazova 1992; Tadepalli and Synolakis 1994; Brocchini and Gentile 2001; Carrier et al. 2003; Kanoglu
2004; Tint1i and Tonmini 2005; Kanoglu and Synolakis 2006; Madsen and Fuhrman 2008; Didenkulova et al. 2007;
Didenkulova 2009; Madsen and Schaffer 2010).
Many of these analytical formulas have been validated experimentally in laboratory tanks (Synolakis 1987, L.1 and Raichlen
2002; Lin et al. 2009; Didenkulova et al. 2013). For most of them, the solitary waves have been used. The soliton is rather
easy to generate in the flume, therefore, laboratory studies of run-up of solitons are the most popular. However, (Madsen et
al. 2008) pointed out that the solitons are inappropriate to describe the real tsunami and proposed to use waves of longer
duration than solitons and downscaled records of real tsunami. Schimmels et al. (2016) and Sriram et al. (2016) generated
such long waves in the Large Wave Flume of Hannover (GWK FZK) using the piston type of wave maker while McGovern
et al. (2018) did it using the pneumatic wave generator.
It should be mentioned that the shape of tsunami varies a lot depending on its origin and the propagation path. One of the
best examples of tsunami wave shape variability 1s given in Shuto (1985) for the 1983 Japan Sea tsunami, where the same
tsunami event resulted in very different tsunami approaches in different locations along Japanese coast. These wave shapes
included: single positive pulses, undergoing both surging and spilling breaking scenarios, breaking bores, periodic wave
trains, surging and breaking as well, a sequence of two or three waves and undular bores. This 1s why there 1s no such term
as “typical tsunami wave shape”, and therefore in the papers on wave run-up cited above many different wave shapes, such
as single pulses, N-waves, periodic symmetric and asymmetric wave trains, are considered. In this paper, we focus on the
nonlinear deformation and run-up of long single pulses of positive polarity on a plane beach.
A similar study was performed for periodic sine waves (Didenkulova et al. 2007; Didenkulova 2009). It was shown that the
run-up height increases with an increase in the wave asymmetry (wave front steepness) which 1s a result of nonlinear wave
deformation during its propagation in a basin of constant depth. It was found analytically that the run-up height of this
nonlinearly deformed sine wave 1s proportional to the square root of the wave front steepness. Later on, this result was also
confirmed experimentally (Didenkulova et al. 2013).
It should be noted that these analytical finding also match tsunami observations. Steep tsunami waves are often witnessed
and reported during large tsunami events, such as 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Tohoku tsunamis. Sometimes the wave,
which approaches the coast, represents a “wall of water” or a bore, which 1s demonstrated by numerous photos and videos of
these events.
The nonlinear steepening of the long single waves of positive polarity has also been observed experimentally in (Sriram et al.
2016), but 1ts effect on wave run-up has not been studied yet. In this paper, we study this effect both analytically and
numerically. Analytically, we apply the methodology developed in (Didenkulova 2009; Didenkulova et al. 2014), where we
consider the processes of wave propagation in the basin of constant depth and the following wave run-up on a plane beach
