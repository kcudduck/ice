this dependence on kh 1s a result of merging plane beach with a flat bottom. This effect can be parameterized with the factor
(L/A)Y*. The result of this parameterization is shown in Fig. 11. Here we can see that for smaller face front wave steepness,
s/so < 1.5, the run-up height 1s proportional to the analytically estimated curve shown by Eq. (16), while for larger face front
wave steepness, s/so > 1.5, the dependence on s/so 1s weaker. This dependence for all numerical run-up height data, presented
in Fig. 11, can be approximated by the power fit (coefficient of determination R-squared = 0.85):

S. Conclusions and Discussion
In this paper, we study the nonlinear deformation and run-up of tsunami waves, represented by single waves of positive
polarity. We consider the conjoined water basin, which consists of a section of constant depth and a plane beach. While
propagating in such basin, the wave shape changes forming a steep front. Tsunamis often approach the coast with a steep
wave front, as it was observed during large tsunami events, e.g. 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2011 Tohoku tsunamu.
The study 1s performed both analytically and numerically in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory. The
analytical solution considers nonlinear wave steepening in the constant depth section and wave run-up on a plane beach
independently and, therefore, does not take into account wave interaction with the toe of the bottom slope. The propagation
along the bottom of constant depth 1s described by Riemann wave, while the wave run-up on a plane beach 1s calculated
using rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow water theory following the Carrier-Greenspan approach. The
numerical scheme does not have this limitation. It employs the finite volume method and is based on the second order UNO2
