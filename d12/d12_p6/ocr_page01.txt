Abstract. The estimate of individual wave run-up is especially important for tsunami warning and risk assessment as it
allows to evaluate the inundation area. Here as a model of tsunami we use the long single wave of positive polarity. The
period of such wave 1s rather long which makes it different from the famous Korteweg-de Vries soliton. This wave
nonlinearly deforms during its propagation in the ocean, what results in a steep wave front formation. Situations, when
waves approach the coast with a steep front are often observed during large tsunamis, e.g. 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011
Tohoku tsunamis. Here we study the nonlinear deformation and run-up of long single waves of positive polarity in the
conjoined water basin, which consists of the constant depth section and a plane beach. The work 1s performed numerically
and analytically in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory. Analytically, wave propagation along the constant
depth section and 1ts run-up on a beach are considered independently without taking into account wave interaction with the
toe of the bottom slope. The propagation along the bottom of constant depth 1s described by Riemann wave, while the wave
run-up on a plane beach is calculated using rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow water theory following the
Carrier-Greenspan approach. Numerically, we use the finite volume method with the second order UNO2 reconstruction in
space and the third order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps. During wave propagation along the constant
depth section, the wave becomes asymmetric with a steep wave front. Shown, that the maximum run-up height depends on
the front steepness of the incoming wave approaching the toe of the bottom slope. The corresponding formula for maximum
run-up height, which takes into account the wave front steepness, 1s proposed.
1. Introduction
Evaluation of wave run-up characteristics 1s one of the most important tasks in coastal oceanography especially when
estimating tsunami hazard. This knowledge 1s required as for planning coastal structures and protection works, as for short-
term tsunami forecast and tsunami warning. Its importance 1s also confirmed by a number of scientific papers, e.g. see recent
works (Tang et al. 2017; Touhami and Khellaf 2017; Zainali et al. 2017; Raz et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018).
