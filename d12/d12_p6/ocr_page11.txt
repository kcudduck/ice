It can be seen that the wave transformation described by the analytical model 1s in a good agreement with numerical
simulations. Therefore, below we reference to the analytically defined wave front steepness having in mind that it well
coincides with the numerical one. Having said this, we approach the main result of this paper, which 1s shown in Fig. 10. The
red solid line gives the analytical prediction. It 1s universal for single waves of positive polarity for different amplitudes A/hg
and kho and can be well approximated by the power fit (coefficient of determination R-squared = 0.99):
Ro /Ry = (5/50) (16)
where Rmax/A 1s the maximum run-up height in the conjoined basin (with a section of constant depth), R¢/A 1s the
corresponding maximum run-up height on a plane beach (without a section of constant depth).

Figure 8: Maximum run-up height, Rmax/A as a function of the distance to the slope, Xo/4 for different kh. Analytical
solution described in Section 2 is shown by lines and numerical solution described in Section 3 is shown by symbols
(triangles, squares and circles) with matching colours; A/ho = 0.03.
The fit 1s shown in Fig. 10 by the black dashed line. For comparison, the dependence of the maximum run-up height on the
wave front steepness obtained using the same method for a sine wave 1s stronger than for a single wave of positive polarity
(Didenkulova et al. 2007) and 1s proportional to the square root of the wave front steepness. This 1s logical as sinusoidal
wave has a sign-variable form and, therefore, excites a higher run-up. For possible mechanisms, see discussion on N-waves
in (Tadepalli and Synolakis 1994).
