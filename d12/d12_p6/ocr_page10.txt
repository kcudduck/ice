The next Fig. 8 supports all the conclusions drawn above. It also shows that difference between analytical and numerical
results increases with an increase in wave period. As pointed out before for small wave periods the numerical solution may
coincide with the analytical one or even become smaller as it happens for kho = 0.38 for Xo /4 > 8.

Figure 7: Maximum run-up height, Rmax/A as a function of initial effective wave length, //Xo (blue axes), and kho
(black axes). Analytical solutions for tan a = 1:20 and tan a = 1:50 are shown by dotted and dashed lines respectively,
while numerical simulations for tan a =1:20 and tan a =1:50 are shown by circles and crosses respectively,
Alho = 0.03.
Important, that both analytical and numerical results in Fig. 5 and Fig. 8 demonstrate an increase in maximum run-up height
with an increase in the distance Xo /A. This result is in agreement with the conclusions of (Didenkulova et al 2007;
Didenkulova, 2009) for sinusoidal waves. In order to be consistent with the results of (Didenkulova et al 2007; Didenkulova,
2009), we connect the distance Xo /A with the incident wave front steepness in the beginning of the bottom slope. The wave
front steepness s is defined as maximum of the time derivative of water displacement, d(n/ A)/d(t/T) , and is studied in
relation with the initial wave front steepness, so, where:

max (dn(x,t)/dt max (dn(x=a,t)/dt
s(x) = max (dnCen/dr) j= max (d(x =a,n/dt) (15)

AIT AIT
In order to calculate the incident wave front steepness in the beginning of the bottom slope from results of numerical
stimulations we should separate the incident wave and the wave reflected from the bottom slope. At the same time, the wave
steepening along the basin of constant depth is very well described analytically as demonstrated in Fig. 9.
