Following the methodology developed in Didenkulova (2008), we let this nonlinearly deformed wave described by Eq. (5)
run-up on a plane beach, characterized by the water depth h(x) = — x tana. This approach does not take into account the
merging point of the two bathymetries and, therefore, does not account for reflection from the toe of the slope and wave
interaction with the reflected wave.

Figure 1: Bathymetry sketch. The wavy curve at the toe of the slope regards analytical solution, which does not take
into account merging between the constant depth and sloping beach sections.
To do this we represent the input wave 77,, as a Fourier integral:

Its complex spectrum B(w) can be found 1n an explicit form in terms of the inverse Fourier transform:

B(w)= 37 Jo (t)exp(—iwt)dt. (7)
Eq. (7) can be re-written in terms of the water displacement, produced by the wave maker at the left boundary (Zahibo et al.
