Figure 5: Maximum run-up height, Rmax/A, as a function of distance to the slope, Xo/4 for different amplitudes of the
initial wave, A/ho. Analytical solution described in Section 2 is shown by lines and numerical solution described in
Section 3 is shown by symbols (triangles, squares and circles) with matching colours, kho = 0.38.
The dependence of maximum run-up height, Rn.x/A on kho 1s shown in Fig. 6 for A/ho = 0.03. It can be seen that the
difference between numerical and analytical results decreases with an increase in kho. We relate this effect with the wave
interaction with the slope, which 1s not properly accounted in our analytical approach. As one can see in Fig. 7, this
difference for a milder beach slope tan a = 1:50 1s reduced.

Figure 6: Maximum run-up height, Rm.x/A as a function of kho for different distances to the slope, Xo/l. Analytical
solution described in Section 2 is shown by lines and numerical solution described in Section 3 is shown by symbols
(diamonds, triangles, squares and circles) with matching colours. The thick black line corresponds to Eq. (14) for
wave run-up on a beach without constant depth section, A/ho = 0.03.
