Figure 3: Run-up height of the long single wave with A = (0.1 m and T = 20 s on a beach slope with tan a = 1:6, the
numerical solution is shown by the red dotted line, analytical solution is shown by the blue dashed line and the
experimental record is shown by the black solid line.
4. Results of numerical and analytical calculations
It 1s reported in (Didenkulova et al 2007; Didenkulova 2009) for a periodic sine wave, that the extreme run-up height
increases proportionally to the square root of the wave front steepness. In this section, we study the nonlinear deformation
and steepening of waves described by Eq. (9) and its effect on the extreme wave run-up height. The corresponding
bathymetry used in analytical and numerical calculations 1s normalized on the water depth in the section of constant depth hy,
and 1s shown in Fig. 1. The input wave parameters such as wave amplitude, A/ho, and effective wave length, A/Xo, where
A =T,/gh, , are changed. The beach slope is taken tan a = 1:20 for all simulations.
We underline that in order to have analytical solution, the criterion of no wave breaking should be satisfied. Therefore, all
analytical and numerical calculations below are chosen for non-breaking waves.
Fig. 4 shows the dimensionless maximum run-up height, Rn.«/A as a function of the initial wave amplitude, A/hg. The
incident wave propagates over different distances to the bottom slope, Xo/A=1.7, 3.4, 5.1, 6.8; kho= 0.38. Analytical
solution described in Section 2 1s shown with lines, and numerical solution described in Section 3 1s shown with symbols
(diamonds, triangles, squares and circles). It can be seen that in most cases and especially for small values of Xo/A =1.7 and
3.4, numerical simulations give larger run-up heights than analytical predictions. These differences can be explained by the
effects of wave interaction with the toe of the underwater beach slope, which are not taken into account in the analytical
solution. For larger distances Xo/A = 6.8, both analytical and numerical solutions give similar results, supported by the
numerical scheme dissipation described in Section 3, which can be considered a “numerical error”. It should be mentioned
that we use zero physical dissipation rate for these simulations, however, small dissipation for stability of the numerical
