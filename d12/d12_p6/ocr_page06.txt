2011a). The bathymetry source term 1s discretized using the hydrostatic reconstruction technique, which implies the well-
balanced property of the numerical scheme (Gosse, 2013).

Figure 2: Water elevations along the 251 m long constant depth section of the Large Wave Flume (GWK), ho = 3.5 m,
A=01m,T=20s, tana = 1:6: results of numerical simulations are shown by the red line, and experimental data are
shown by the blue line.
The numerical scheme 1s validated against experimental data of wave propagation and run-up in the Large Wave Flume
(GWK), Hannover, Germany. The experiments were set with a flat bottom with constant depth hop = 3.5 m and length
[a, b] = 251 m, and a plane beach with a slope tan a = 1:6 (see Fig. 1). The flume had 16 wave gauges along the constant
depth section and a run-up gauge on the slope. The incident wave had amplitude, A = 0.1 m, and period, T = 20 s. The
detailed description of the experiments can be found in Didenkulova et al (2013). The results of numerical simulations are in
a good agreement with the laboratory experiments as along the constant depth section (see Fig. 2) as also on the beach
(Fig. 3). The comparison of run-up height calculated numerically and analytically using the approach described in Section 2
with the experimental record in shown 1n Fig. 3. It can be seen that the experimentally recorded wave 1s slightly smaller
which may be caused by the bottom friction and especially on the slope. Both numerical and analytical models describe the
first wave of positive polarity rather well. The numerical prediction of run-up height is slightly higher than the analytical
one. This additional increase in the run-up height in numerical model may be explained by the nonlinear interaction with the
reflected wave, which 1s not taken into account in the analytical model. The wave of negative polarity 1s much more sensitive
to all the effects mentioned above than the wave of positive polarity and, therefore, looks different for all three lines in
Fig. 3. By introducing additional dissipation in numerical model one can easily reach perfect agreement between the
numerical simulations and experimental data. However, we do not do so, since below we are focusing on the analysis of
analytical results and for clarity would like to avoid additional parameters in the numerical model. Also, we focus on the
maximum run-up height and, therefore, expect small differences between the results of analytical and numerical models.
