Acknowledgements
The authors are very grateful to Professor Efim Pelinovsky, who gave an idea to this study a few years ago. Analytical
calculations were performed with the support of RSF grant 16-17-0004 1. Numerical simulations and its comparison with the
analytical findings were supported by the ETAG grant PUTI1378. Authors also thank the PHC PARROT project
No 37456 YM, which funded the authors’ visits to France and Estonia and allowed this collaboration.
