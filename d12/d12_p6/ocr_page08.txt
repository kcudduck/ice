scheme is still needed and this may become noticeable at large distances. For the sech?-shaped wave (A/hy = 0.03, A/X, =
0.12) propagation, the reduction of initial wave amplitude constitutes ~2 %.
It 1s worth mentioning, that for small initial wave amplitudes all run-up heights are close to each other and are close to the
thick black line, which corresponds to Eq. (14) for wave run-up on a beach without constant depth section. This means that
the effects we are talking about are important only for nonlinear waves and irrelevant for weakly nonlinear or almost linear
waves.
The same effects can be seen in Fig. 5, which shows the maximum run-up height, Rn.«/A as a function of distance to the
slope, Xo/A, for different amplitudes of the initial wave, A/ho. The distance Xo/A changes from 0.8 to 9.4; kho = 0.38. The
analytical solution 1s shown with lines while the numerical solution 1s shown with symbols (triangles, squares and circles). It
can be seen in Fig. 5, for smaller values of Xo/A < 6 numerical predictions provide relatively larger run-up values, as
compared with analytical predictions, while for higher values of Xo/A > 6 the differences are significantly reduced. A
relevant change of this behaviour 1s given for A/hp = 0.06. We can observe that numerical predictions for this amplitude
become smaller than analytical predictions for Xo/A > 8. As stated above, we believe that this can be a result of interplay of
two effects: interaction with the underwater bottom slope, which 1s not taken into account in the analytical prediction and the
numerical scheme dissipation (“numerical error”), which affects the numerical results.
