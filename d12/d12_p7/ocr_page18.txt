leading waves, and fail to capture the high-frequency oscillations, which 1n this case start slightly
ahead of the estimated arrival time (blue dashed line). These are most likely associated with the
additional free waves generated by the interaction of locked waves with changing bathymetry. In
the Northeast Pacific Ocean (Figure 8d), the situation 1s almost identical, but the trailing waves
are larger than those in the Northwest Pacific Ocean region. In the Southeast Pacific (1.e., South
America, Figure 7¢), the separation of the leading locked waves and trailing free waves 1s more
obvious than in other regions, because the propagation distances are longer (Liu and Higuera,
2022). Besides, the amplitude of the trailing waves 1s significantly larger than that of the leading
waves. The main reason 1s that the DART locations are almost 10,000 km away from Tonga, and
the atmospheric pressure waves have decayed significantly, producing a small leading locked wave.
Moreover, the trailing free waves are largely amplified when the atmospheric pressure travels over
Tonga’s Trench (which has a maximum depth of approximately 10,000 m), approaching Proudman
resonance conditions (Proudman, 1929), as will be explained in more detail in a later section.
