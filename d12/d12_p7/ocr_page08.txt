Figure 4 The evolution of the average speed of the atmospheric pressure wave as a function of
the distance from the source of explosion (left panel) and the time from the explosion (right panel).
Based on the available data, an empirical atmospheric pressure wave model in the spherical
coordinate system 1s proposed as follows:
pa(r, t) = A(X, (1) N(r, 1), (1)
where
N(rt) = ~V3 sech?[Y(r — X,(t))]tanh[Y(r — X;(t))], (2)
t _
X,(t) = [ c(t)dt = ¢ (t)t, (3)
in which p, denotes the atmospheric pressure disturbance produced by the explosion, measured 1n
[hPa] relative to normal conditions, at a given distance from the source (, measured in meters)
and time from the event (7, in seconds). Using the spherical coordinate system in terms of longitude
and latitude (v1, ¢1), the great-circle distance between the target location and the position of Hunga
Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Volcano (yo= 175.39°W, po= 20.546°S) 1s calculated as:
r = 2R asin sin? (F579) + cos(p,) cos(¢,) sin? =0) (4)
in which, R is the Earth radius (6.371x10° m).

As indicated in Equation (1), the atmospheric pressure 1s modeled as the product of two
functions. The shape function, N(7 ¢) in Equation (2), prescribes the N-wave shape (see Tadepalli
and Synolakis, 1994). The amplitude function, A(X;(¢)), provides the variations for the peak and
trough pressure values, as a function of the distance X;(#). As defined in Equation (3), X:(¢¥) can
