mechanism for tsunami generation. Two separate tsunami waves, travelling at different speeds, can
be distinguished. Additional tsunami waves are also generated when the pressure wave travels over
steep deep ocean features such as the Tonga Trench, leading to significantly larger waves 1n the
Southeast part of the Pacific Ocean.
1 Introduction

On January 15, 2022 at approximately 04:15 (UTC), the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga—
Hunga Ha‘apai, located on the Tongan archipelago, exploded violently. The eruption produced a
plume that elevated 58 km into the troposphere and an atmospheric pressure shock wave,
propagating at a speed close to the sound speed, ~306-320 m/s (Amores et al., 2022; Burt, 2022;
Matoza et al., 2022; Yuen et al., 2022). These atmospheric pressure waves were captured at weather
stations around the world and were found circling the Earth at least 5 times over several days
following the explosion (Amores et al., 2022). In addition, sea level oscillations were also observed
all around the world. In the Pacific Ocean, DART buoys recorded tsunami waves with amplitudes
ranging from a few centimeters to twenty centimeters (https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/Dart/). The
coastal (tidal) gauges also recorded tsunami waves (http:// www.10c-sealevelmonitoring.org/). In
the region far away from Tonga, the tsunami amplitudes were found to exceed 1 m (e.g., Chile,
Japan, and USA). Tsunami waves were also captured in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea,
even though they are not directly connected to the Pacific Ocean. Despite the complexity of the
problem, theoretical studies (e.g., Liu and Higuera, 2022) have illustrated the basic physical
mechanisms by which under the moving atmospheric pressure forcing the leading (locked) and
trailing (free) waves can be simultaneously produced. While the locked waves propagate with the
speed of the atmospheric pressure waves (~ 1,100 km/hr), the trailing free waves propagate with
long gravity ocean wave (~ 750 km/hr) (e.g., Omira et al. 2022). Moreover, additional free waves
are generated when the locked waves propagate over large bathymetric variations, such as trenches
and seamounts (Vennell 2007). Lynett et al. (2022) argued that the trailing waves may also be
associated with other generation mechanisms directly linked with the volcanic explosion, such as
the collapse of the caldera.

Historically, there have been several tsunami events associated with volcanic eruptions. The
most recent event 1s the 2018 Anak Krakatau eruption. During the eruption, the cone collapsed,
