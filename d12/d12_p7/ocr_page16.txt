from the near-field to the mid-range-field, as specified by the model. Six hours after the explosion,
the amplitude has reduced to approximately 1 hPa, and after 10 hours, the atmospheric pressure
wave 1s already propagating away from the Pacific Ocean. The atmospheric pressure waves will
eventually circle around the Earth and return to the Pacific Ocean several times. However, the
present empirical model 1s only applicable to the initial stage covering the first pass over the Pacific
Ocean.

The panel (b) in Figure 7 shows the corresponding snapshots of the simulated tsunami waves
in the Pacific Ocean. The tsunami waves originate in the vicinity the volcano, where the amplitude
1s significantly larger due to the large atmospheric pressure in the near-field, which decays fast, as
mentioned before. The snapshots of the tsunami at 1 h and 2 h show that the tsunami wave heights
to the East of Tonga are larger than those to the West. This 1s due to Proudman resonance condition
occurring over the Tonga Trench, where the Froude number Fr = NT 1s close to the critical
condition. This point will be further discussed in Section 3.3. From the rest of the snapshots in
Figure 7 (b), it 1s clear that the area of influence of the tsunami waves 1s always confined within
the reach of atmospheric pressure waves, because the leading wave 1s the fastest-travelling one
and 1s locked to the atmospheric pressure wave. At 6 h, the leading and trailing tsunami waves are
easily distinguished, since the separation between them 1s approximately 2,350 km, which 1s more
than twice the wavelength. The higher wave heights continue to propagate towards America, where
the highest waves from among the far-field locations were recorded. Interestingly, some waves can
be distinguished in the Caribbean Sea in the last panel. These have been generated by the
atmospheric pressure wave, after it has propagated over Central America, which acts as a barrier
for the waves that were produced on the Pacific Ocean.

Figure 8 illustrates the comparisons of the corrected DART data (black line) and simulated
numerical results (red line), arranged from the near-field to the far-field stations. The locations of
these stations can be found in Figure 6 (a). The gray arrow marks the arrival of the leading locked
wave. The blue dash vertical line indicates the expected arrival time of the trailing free wave,
which 1s calculated as the distance from Tonga to the station over the estimated long wave speed
of 756 km/h, calculated for a constant average depth of 4,500 m, representative of the Pacific
Ocean. We note the arrival times of the locked and free waves in the near-field (e.g., DART G) are
almost simultaneous, because the speed of propagation of the atmospheric pressure wave 1s small
