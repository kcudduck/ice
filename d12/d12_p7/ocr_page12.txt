storm surge due to the “inverse barometer” sea level response to pressure. However, since the
atmospheric pressure fluctuations induced by the Tonga volcano eruption are significant and the
leading wave 1s “locked” in phase with the atmospheric pressure wave, the DART reported data
must be corrected to 1solate the actual tsunami waves. Based on the analysis of Liu and Higuera
(2022), the formula to approximately correct the DART measurements can be expressed as

n= 0, (8)

where c 1s the speed of the atmospheric pressure wave, which 1s fixed, and d 1s the local water
depth. It can be observed that the correction method 1s dependent on the local water depth, and
results in a reduction of the DART reported data for F-> 1, which 1s the case for the Tonga event.
Moreover, this reduction (Equation 8) 1s linearly proportional to the water depth, thus, the formula
will produce a relatively larger correction in shallower waters.

Figure 6 shows the location of the DART buoy stations across the Pacific Ocean (panel a) and
corrected and un-corrected time series of free surface elevations at 4 selected DART buoy stations
(panels b~¢). These stations have been selected because the water depths cover a wide range: 1,807
m (DART52406), 3,273 m (DART32411), 4,230 m (DART46409) and 5,742 m (DART G),
respectively. To correct the DART data, the atmospheric pressure at the DART buoy location 1s
first estimated using the empirical atmospheric pressure model. The duration of the atmospheric
pressure wave 1s extracted and used as a mask to correct the DART data only within the relevant
window (shown 1n grey line), using Equation 8. The speeds of atmospheric pressure wave at each
station are calculated, which 1n this case are almost a constant (~ 319 m/s), since these stations are
farther than 1,000 km from Tonga. Therefore, the Froude number at these buoys ranges from 1.32
(DART52406) to 2.4 (DART G), depending on the local water depths. The blue line 1s the
originally reported DART data and the black line denotes the corrected time series, 1.e., the actual
tsunami free surface elevation. It can be observed that, as mentioned before, the relative reduction
1s larger for shallower water depths. Panels b~¢ in Figure 6 are arranged in terms of increasing
water depths. Therefore, the most significant reduction occurs for DART 52406, from 3.8 cm of
positive wave amplitude reported to 0.7 cm after the correction.
