Appendix B. Comparisons with Lynett et al.’s model

Lynett et al. (2022) have presented an alternative model to describe the atmospheric pressure
and numerical simulations of the induced tsunami. The atmospheric pressure wave 1s formulated
by defining the crest and trough independently to produce the distinctive N-wave shape. The crest
and trough present the same basic shape (exponential curves decaying with the square of the phase),
but each one has its own amplitude, celerity and wavelength (or wave period). These three are
functions of time and that have been found using the available atmospheric pressure data. Lynett
et al. (2022) adopted pressure data obtained from 134 weather stations with a sampling frequency
of 6-10 minutes, located all around the globe. Thus, the measurements from some of those stations
may be affected by the surrounding topographical features, unlike those carefully selected 1n this
work. Lynett et al’s model offers a high flexibility, with 6 main parameters, and can account for
the changes in wavelength of the pressure wave. In contrast, the model proposed in this paper
(Equations 1-6) offers only 3 parameters (the amplitudes of crest and trough and the joint celerity),
considering a constant wavelength.

Apart from the differences in the empirical atmospheric models, there are significant
differences 1n the simulation procedure, as follows. On the one hand, while Lynett et al.’s model
adopted a Cartesian coordinate system based on the azimuthally equidistant projection, the present
model uses spherical coordinates, which 1s a more physical representation of reality. In addition,
we have accounted for Coriolis force. On the other hand, Lynett et al.’s model considered
additional wave generation mechanisms (e.g., caldera collapse) on top of the atmospheric pressure
wave, which introduce shorter waves 1n the system, whereas the present model only considers the
latter. As a result, Lynett et al.’s model 1s based on the Boussinesq equations, which account for
the frequency dispersion effect, while the present model adopts a (non-dispersive) LSWE model.

In order to allow a direct comparison between the performance of both models, Lynett et al.’s
results have been analyzed and presented in Figure 14, which can be directly compared with Figure
9. In both cases the arrival time data 1s virtually the same, and very close to a perfect fit. Regarding
crest and trough amplitudes, the R? is very similar or slightly better in Lynett et al.’s (2022) case,
while the root mean square error (RMSE) metrics are higher by approximately 20% and 60% than
