proportional to the pressure times the amplification factor —— (Vennell, 2007; Liu and Higuera,
2022). Applying this expression considering the maximum positive amplitude of the pressure
model as a function of the distance to Tonga (Equation 5) and the local depth at each point in space
to calculate the amplification factor, a simple estimator of the leading wave positive amplitude can
be constructed. The theoretical distribution of the maximum leading wave 1s shown in Figure 12.
We remark that this 1s a crude approximation, since it assumes an immediate response of the water
and there are additional physical processes such as wave scattering, shoaling, refraction,
diffraction, etc., which are not captured. The processes, however, are correctly captured by the
numerical simulation. Consequently, it interesting to compare Figure 12 with panel (b) in Figure
11 to evaluate the main differences.

To start with, a large amplification factor of approximately 25 1s obtained over Tonga’s Trench,
leading to the largest theoretical amplitudes of the locked wave, exceeding 1 m. Other trenches,
like Mariana, Japan and Kuril, located in the Pacific Nortwest, also show potential large wave
heights due to the same mechanisms. However, pressure has decayed significantly by the time it
reaches those locations, leading to lower wave heights overall. Despite, the shortcomings of the
simplified analysis, the comparison with panel (b) in Figure 11 presents similarities. The main
differences occur inside the dashed line circle, where the locked and free waves overlap, and where
wave scattering 1s significant. Because of this, the wave heights in the vicinity of Tonga (black
star) are much larger in the numerical model solution. At the east side of Tonga’s Trench, the degree
of similarity increases, although the numerical model solutions present a larger wave over a wider
geographical area, for the aforementioned reasons. Outside the circle, where the influence of the
leading wave can be 1solated from the effects of the trailing waves, the degree of similarity 1s
outstanding, matching not only in terms of the general patterns, but also in terms of the final
amplitude. Therefore, 1t can be concluded that the analytical model of Liu and Higuera (2022) 1s
applicable to real conditions, especially in areas with small bathymetry gradients.
