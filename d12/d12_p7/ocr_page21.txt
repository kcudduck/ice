3.2 Wavelet analysis

Using the Morlet (Gaussian-windowed sinusoid) Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT)
analysis, the time evolution of the dominant wave components of the free surface elevation at
selected DART stations are presented in Figure 10. The stations (a-f), are arranged based on
increasing distance to Tonga, from top to bottom. The wavelet results based on the corrected DART
data are shown 1n the left column and the results based on the numerical simulations are given in
the right column. The arrival time of the leading wave 1s marked with a white dashed line, while
the white continuous line represents the estimated arrival time of the trailing wave. The arrival
time of the trailing wave at DART buoy (G) is not shown because it 1s almost concurrent to the
leading wave, as this location 1s very close to the volcano. At the DART buoy (G), the dominant
wave periods range from 10 to 64 minutes mitially. Additional components with periods of 5
minutes and shorter appear later, 1 hour from the explosion, as the energy contained in higher
period waves reduces progressively, almost disappearing 2 hours after the event. From this point
on, the “ringing” effect for high-frequency waves becomes intermittent and continues for several
hours. The numerical results are only able to capture the low frequency waves, with a slightly
smaller block (15 — 40 minutes) centered around the 28 minutes period, since additional wave
generation mechanisms have not been considered in the present model. This situation can be
observed 1n all subsequent numerical modelling results, which lack short period waves below ~15
minutes. Moreover, the numerical results at DART G show an additional long period component
at 70 minutes, with higher energy content, when compared to the field data. A common factor
between the DART data and the numerical model data at DART G (the closest to the volcano) 1s
that energy exists before the arrival of the leading wave. However, these points appear in both
panels, and lie outside the cone of influence of the CWT (yellow curved dashed line). For those
reasons, they should be considered as an energy “leakage” instead of actual long wave conditions
at the site prior to the explosion.

Based on the results, the numerical simulation based on the simple atmospheric model can
successfully reproduce 1n a qualitative way the longer period waves (40 minutes at DART 51425,
