Abstract
Employing a linear shallow water equation (LSWE) model in the spherical coordinates, this paper
investigates the tsunami waves generated by the atmospheric pressure shock waves due to the
explosion of the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga—Hunga Ha‘apai on January 15, 2022. Using the
selected 59 atmospheric pressure records in the Pacific Ocean, an empirical atmospheric pressure
model 1s first constructed. Applying the atmospheric pressure model and realistic bathymetric data
in the LSWE model, tsunami generation and propagation are simulated in the Pacific Ocean. The
numerical results show clearly the co-existence of the leading locked waves, propagating with the
speed of the atmospheric pressure waves (~ 1,100 km/hr), and the trailing free waves, propagating
with long gravity ocean wave celerity (~ 750 km/hr). During the event, tsunamis were reported by
41 DART buoys 1n the Pacific Ocean, which require corrections because of the occurrence of
atmospheric pressure waves. The numerically simulated tsunami arrival time and the amplitudes
of the wave crest and trough of the leading locked waves compare reasonably well with the
corrected DART measurements. The comparisons for the trailing waves are less satisfactory, since
free waves could also have been generated by other tsunami generation mechanisms, which have
not been considered in the present model, and by the scattering of locked waves over changing
bathymetry. In this regard, the numerical results show clearly that the deep Tonga trench (~ 10 km)
amplifies the trailing waves in the Southeast part of the Pacific Ocean via the Proudman resonance
condition.

Plain Language Summary
On January 15, 2022, the eruption of the submarine volcano Hunga Tonga—Hunga Ha‘apai, the
largest volcano eruption in recent centuries, produced worldwide atmospheric pressure
fluctuations and tsunami waves. In this paper we produced a simple model for atmospheric
pressure 1n the Pacific Ocean based on selected pressure recordings. Based on this pressure model
and realistic bathymetric data, we simulate the tsunami generation and propagation in the Pacific
Ocean. We found that the explosion shock wave induced by the volcanic eruption 1s the main
