Appendix A. Frequency dispersion effects
To investigate the significance of frequency dispersion on the tsunami wave generation and
propagation during the Tonga event, an additional numerical simulation, using the linear
Boussinesq equations has been performed.
Before presenting the numerical results, Glimsdal et al. (2013) introduced the parameter rt,
known as “dispersion time”, to assess the potential effect that dispersion has on wave propagation:
