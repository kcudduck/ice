4 Conclusions

In this study, we first constructed an N-wave function to describe the atmospheric pressure
characteristics induced by the eruption of the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apair Volcano. The
empirical model was calibrated with field measurements. The atmospheric pressure crest
amplitude increases from the source in the near field, then decreases slowly moving aways from
the source. On the other hand, the trough amplitude of the atmospheric pressure decreases quickly
from the source in the near-field, and then slowly 1n the far-field. The propagation speed of the
atmospheric pressure increases in the near-field and becomes a constant speed of 319 m/s at about
1,000 km from the volcano. The method suggested by Liu and Higuera (2022) 1s adopted to correct
the DART measurements to exclude the atmospheric pressure influence in the signal for the free
surface elevation.

Based on the LSWE model, the simulated tsunami waves results match reasonably well with
the corrected DART measurements in terms of the tsunami arrival time and tsunami amplitude
from the near-field to the far-field, especially for the leading wave and most parts of the trailing
wave. However, the short-wave components of the trailing waves, which could possibly be
generated by another generation mechanism, cannot be captured by the present numerical model.
The wavelet analysis for the corrected DART data and the numerical results supports this point.
We successfully separate the tsunami leading wave and trailing wave numerically and theoretically.
The larger atmospheric pressure amplitude and Tonga Trench increase the tsunami leading wave
in the near field. The amplification effect induced by Tonga Trench plays an important role in the
large amplitudes in the Southeast Pacific. We also investigated the importance of the frequency
dispersion effect. The results show that the dispersion effect 1s minor for the 2022 Tonga event,
due to 1ts long wavelength of 900 km. We further compared our results with Lynett et al. (2022)â€™s
model, as we have applied similar method. Both models capture the pressure forcing mechanism,
including the trailing waves in the far-field. This indicates that a significant part of the trailing
waves 1s induced by the atmospheric shock wave. In conclusion, the method suggested 1n the study
could explain the tsunami generation and propagation generated by the 2022 Tonga volcano
eruption in the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, the other possible mechanisms should be investigated
to explain the trailing waves with shorter periods.
