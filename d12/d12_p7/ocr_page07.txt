Figure 2 Similarity of atmospheric pressure data at different locations. The upper panel (a) plots
the time histories of atmospheric pressure at three stations near Japan, and (b) shows the collapsed time
histories when the arrival times are aligned . The lower panels (¢) and (d) show the same features for
three stations near Chile. Time in panels (b) and (d) is relative to the arrival time.

The atmospheric pressure data exhibits strong similarity in the far field. As shown in Figure 2,
the time series of atmospheric pressure at three stations near Japan and Chile, present a distinctive
N-wave shape when the arrival times are aligned, with the positive pressure at the crest being
higher than the negative pressure at the trough. These stations are more than 6,000 km away from
the source of explosion. The N-wave shape similarity 1s less obvious in the near field. Some of the
near field data (e.g., Nomuka and Nukalofa, located less than 100 km from the source) do not show
a clear crest, but are instead dominated by a deep trough, as shown in Figure 5 (black line). In the
mid- and far-field the amplitudes of the atmospheric pressure wave crest and trough decay slowly
with the distance to the source, as indicated in Figure 3. However, in the near-field, the pressure
wave crest grows rapidly (see panel 3b). Moreover, the speed of the atmospheric pressure wave
propagation at any atmospheric pressure sensor station can also be estimated. In this paper, the
average speed, c(t), 1s calculated by dividing the distance from the source to the atmospheric
pressure station by the travel time, which 1s the time when the atmospheric pressure signal first
crosses the 0.001 hPa mark ahead of the arrival of the first pressure peak. The 1nitial time of the
event 1s set at 04:15 on 15th of January 2022. The estimated average wave celerity of the pressure
wave as a function of the distance from the volcano 1s plotted in the left panel of Figure 4, showing
that the atmospheric pressure speeds up quickly in the near field and reaches a constant value of
~319 m/s. The right panel of Figure 4 shows the same datapoints, but as a function of the time
elapsed from the explosion, based on the arrival (1.e., travel) time definition.
