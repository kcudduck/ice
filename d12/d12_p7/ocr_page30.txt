where d 1s water depth, L 1s wavelength, co 1s water wave celerity, T 1s wave period and D 1s
propagation distance. In this study, the characteristic wavelength L 1s 900,000 m and the average
water depth 1s approximately 4,500 m, which 1s representative of the Pacific Ocean. The effects of
wave frequency dispersion accumulate in time/space. Therefore, according to Glimsdal et al.
(2013), if 7 < 0.01, the dispersion effects are small, and if 7 > 0.1, the dispersion effects become
significant. For a propagation distance of 10,000 km, which 1s the order of magnitude of the width
of the Pacific Ocean, 7 1s 0.0016. This suggests already that the frequency dispersion effects for
the Tonga event are expected to be negligible.

The time series of the surface elevation at two DART buoys 1n the far-field comparing the
dispersive and non-dispersive simulations are plotted in Figure 13. The results show minor
differences only, with deviations being less than 6%. This indicates that the dispersion effect can
be safely ignored when simulating the wave driven by the moving pressure in the 2022 Tonga
tsunami event, since the pressure shock wave 1s a very long wave. This conclusion, however, does
not hold when reproducing the other wave generation mechanisms. The additional mechanisms
produce significantly shorter waves, as has been shown in Lynett et al. (2022). Therefore, shorter
waves will be more affected because they travel a longer distance relative to their wavelength, as
will be further discussed in the next section.
