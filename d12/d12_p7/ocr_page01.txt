Key Points
1. Using the measured data, an N-wave shaped atmospheric pressure model 1s constructed for the
2022 Tonga event.
2. The atmospheric pressures generate both locked waves, propagating at the speed of pressure,
and trailing free waves with a long wave speed.
3. The trailing free tsunami waves can be as significant as the leading locked tsunami waves, which
are amplified by the Proudman resonance.
