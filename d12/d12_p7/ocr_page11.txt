2.2 Correction for DART Buoy data
In the Pacific Ocean, 41 DART buoy stations reported the sea level fluctuations. Normally, the
DART buoy records the sea elevation data every 15 minutes. However, when the buoy detects a
tsunami or abnormal sea level fluctuations, the sampling rate increases to 1 minute or 15 seconds
(Meinig et al., 2005). Since the DART system measures the sea surface elevation using a bottom-
mounted pressure recorder, 1ts measurements (¢) include both atmospheric pressure fluctuations
(P,) and the sea level variation (1) (Rabinovich and Eble, 2015),

where p 1s the density of seawater and g 1s the gravitational acceleration. When tsunami waves
are generated by an earthquake, the atmospheric pressure variations are negligible and the reported
measurement ({) 1s the same as the sea level variation (7). Moreover, DART stations do not record
