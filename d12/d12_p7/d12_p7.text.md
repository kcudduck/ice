U si ng   the  selected 59   atmospheric   pressure   records   in the Pacific Ocean , an   empirical   atmospheric pressure  model   is   first   constructed .   Applying   the   atmospheric   pressure   model   and realistic bathymetric data  in th e   LSWE   model,   tsunami generation and propagation are simulated in the Pacific Ocean.   The  numerical results show clearly   the co - existence of   the leading locked waves, propagating with   the  speed of   the atmospheric pressure waves   (~ 1,100 km/hr) , and   the   trailing free waves, propagating  with long gravity ocean wave   celerity   (~ 750 km/hr).   During the event,   tsunamis   were   report ed by  41   DART buoys in the Pacific Ocean , which   require corrections because of the   occurrence   of  atmospheric pressure waves.   The   numerically   simulated   tsunami arrival tim e   and   the   amplitude s  of   the   wave   crest and trough   of the leading locked waves   compare   reasonably well   w ith   the  corrected DART   measurements .   The comparisons for the trailing waves are less satisfactory, since  free waves could   also have been   generated by other tsunami generation mechanisms, which have  not   been considered in the present model , and by   the   scattering of locked wave s   over changing  bathymetry.   In this regard , the numerical results show   clearly   that the   deep   Tonga trench   ( ~ 10 km)  amplifies the trailing waves   in the Southeast part of the Pacific   Ocean   via the   Proudman resonance  condition .

Two separate tsunami waves, travelling at different speeds, can  be distinguished. Additional tsunami waves are also generated when t he pressure wave travels over  steep deep ocean features such as   the Tonga Trench, leading to significantly larger waves   in the  Southeast part of the Pacific Ocean.  1 Introduction  On January   15,   2022   at   approximately   04:15 (UTC) ,   the submarine volcano Hung a Tonga –  Hunga Haʻapai,   located   on the Tongan archipelago ,   exploded violently . The eruption   produced a  plume   that   elevated 58 km into the troposphere and a n atmospheric   pressure shock wave ,  propagating at a speed close to the   sound   speed, ~306 - 320 m/s (Amores et al., 2022; Burt, 2022;  Matoza et al. ,   2022;   Yuen et al., 2022). Th ese   atmospheric   pressure   wave s   w ere   captured   at   weather  station s around the world and w ere   found circl ing   the   E arth   at least 5 times   over   several   days  following   the explosion   (Amores et al., 2022).   In addition,   sea   level oscillation s   were also observed  all   around the world . In the Pacific Ocean,   DART   b uoys recorded   tsunami waves   with amplitude s  ranging   f rom a few   centimeters to twenty centimeters   ( https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/Dart/ ). The  coastal   (tidal)   gauges also   recorded   tsunami wave s   ( http://www.ioc - sealevelmonitoring.org/ ).   I n  the   region far away from Tonga , the tsunami amplitude s   w ere   found to   exceed 1 m (e.g., Chile,  Japan, and USA).   T sunami wave s were also   captured in the   Atlantic   Ocean   and   Mediterranean   Sea,  even though they   are   not directly   connected to the Pacific Ocean .   Despite the complexity of the  problem,   theoretical studie s ( e.g.,   Liu   and Higuera, 2022)   have illustrated the basic physical  mechanisms   by which   under the moving atmospheric pressure forcing   the leading   (locked)   and  trailing   (free)   waves   can be simultaneously   produced .   While the locked waves   propagat e   with the  speed of the atmospheric pressure waves (~ 1,100 km/hr), the trailing free waves propagat e   with  long gravity ocean wave (~ 750 km/hr)   (e.g., Omira et al. 2022) .   Moreover,   additional   free waves  are   generated when the locked waves propagate over la rge bathymetric variations, such as trench es  and seamount s   (Vennell   2007 ).   Lynett et al. (2022)   argued   that the trailing wave s   may also be  associated with other   generation   mechanism s   directly linked with the volcanic explosion , such as  the   collapse   of the   caldera .  Historically, there have been several   tsunami events associated with volcan ic   eruption s . T he  most recent   event   is the 2018   Anak Krakatau   e ruption. During the eruption,   the cone   collapse d,

T he runup  in th e 2018   event   exceeded 10 m along the coast s   of the   Sunda Strait ,   but   the impact of the tsunami  was local .   No atmospheric pressure wave was recorded.   On the other hand, the   1 8 83   Krakatau  volcano   explo sion   generated   significant   a tmospheric   pressure waves ,   which were recorded in  Europe and the United States, lasting for nine days ( Choi et al., 2002 ).   T he tsunami   wave s   w ere  complex   in the near field ,   since   there were at least   three   possible generation   mechanisms : caldera  collapse, submarine explosion, and   p yroclastic flow   ( Maeno   and   Imamura, 2011 ).   In the far field,  the   correlation s   between the   measure d   a tmospheric   pressure   waves   and   tsunami   wave s   suggested  that   the atmospheric pressure waves were the   possible origin of the tsunami   waves   ( Fr a ncis , 1985).  Omira et al. (2022) has provided information on a dditional   historical   volcanic explosions   that are  link ed   to   similar tsunami generation mechanisms.  For the 2022 Tonga event, abundant atmospheric pressure data and tsunami records   are  available   in the Pacific Ocean   region . The objective s   of   this paper   are   to correlate these two   sets  of data and understand the main tsunami wave features generated   by the moving atmospheric  pressure. To   achieve   these   goals,   we   first   construct   a n   empirical   model   to   describe   the  characteristics of the   atmospheric   pressure   in time and space using the m easured atmospheric  pressure data in the Pacific Ocean after Tonga’s volcanic explosion .   This empirical atmospheric  model is then used as the forcing function in a   linear shallow   water   equation model   to generate  tsunami waves. The numerical results   are c ompared wit h   measurements , including the DART buoy  data , which require   a   correct ion because the appearance of atmospheric pressure   ( Liu and Higuera ,  2022) .   The wavelet   analysis is applied   to   the   corrected DART data and the numerical results   to  reveal   the   t ime evolution of the dominant wave components of the free surface elevation at selected  DART stations .   The dispersion effect on the tsunami propagation induced by the moving  atmospheric pressure shock wave   is discussed. The results of Lynett et al. (2022),   which used a  similar method, also are compared with our results.  This paper is structured as follows.   Section 2.1 describes the procedure of constructing the  empirical atmospheric pressure model. Section 2.2 explains briefly the reason why the DART buoy  d ata needs to be corrected when the atmospheric pressure wave appears. Section 2.3   outlines the  LSWE model   setup .   Section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the numerical modelling results,  compared against the field observations. In addition, the role that dispersion plays   in the pressure -  driven tsunami propagation and the main differences with respect to the atmospheri c model

Finally, conclusions are drawn in  Section 4.  2   Data   and Methods  2 .1   A tmospheric   Pressure   Observations and   Empirical   Model  After   Tonga’s   volcan ic   eruption,   thousands   o f   Meteorological   stations around the world  captured   the   atmospheric   pressure   shock wave .   These   observations could be seriously affected by  the   location of the instrument and its surrounding   topography . For example,   several   stations locate d  in the cities of N ew Zealand   present significantly   smaller   pressure peak s   than   those located near  the coast.   Moreover, t he   atmospheric   pressure in Santiago   d e   Chile   presents   overly high   values ,  which could be caused by   the   Andes Mountains   (reaching 6,500 m above sea level)   partially  reflecting the   atmospheric pressure   wave . Therefore,   to construct an empirical atmospheric  pressure model   in the Pacific Ocean ,   we   select   atmospheric   pressure   stations   based on   two  principles :   (1) T h e instrument must be   located at   the   coast,   and   (2)   they need to be   far from   sharp  orographic features (e.g.,   mountain s   or valley s) .  In total ,   we have selected   59 stations , as shown in Figure 1 ,   over   three regions .   T he near  field   region   is defined as   the area within   3 , 000 km from Tonga,   and comprises   16 stations (Fiji  Meteorological   Service,   Weather   Underground,   NIWA) ,   providing   atmospheric   pressure  measurements with a   5 - 10 min sampling frequency .   T he   mid - field   region   is   within   3 , 000 - 6 , 000  km,   and   the far - field   region   i s   farther   than 6 , 000 km   from Tonga .   There are   43   additional   stations  within these two   regions , including   10 stations from Japan Soratena, 15 stations from   the  Meteorological Directorate of Chile, 2 stations from Taiwan,   and   16 stations from   the   National  Climatic Data Center of USA , providing   a   1 min sampling frequency . H igher sampling rate s are  more likely to capture the peak   values   of the atmospheric pressure w aves , thus, providing a more  accurate representation   of the event .

The upper panel (a) plots  the time histories of atmosp h eric   pressure at three stations near Japan, and (b)   shows the collapsed time  histories   when   t he arrival time s are aligned   . The lower panels (c) and (d) show the   same   feature s   for  three stations near Chile.   Time in panels (b) and   (d)   is relative to the arrival time.  T he atmospheric pressure data   exhibits strong similarity   in the far   field .   As   shown in Figure 2,  the time series of atmospheric pressure at three stations near Japan and Chile ,   present   a distinctive  N - wave   shape   when   the arrival times are aligned ,   with   the positive pressure   at the   crest   being  higher than the negative pressure   at the   trough.   These stations are more than 6,000 km   away   from  the source of explosion. The N - wave sh a pe similarity is less obvious in the   near field.   Some of the  near field data   ( e.g.,   Nomuka and Nukalofa , located less than 100 km from the source)   do   not show  a   clear crest , but   are   instead   dominate d   by   a   deep   trough ,   as   shown   in Figure 5 (black line) .   I n the  mid -   and far - field the   amplitude s   of   the   atmospheric   pressure wave   crest and trough   decay   slowly  with the distance to the source ,   as   indicated   in Figure   3 .   However, in the near - field, the pressure  wave crest grows rapidly   ( see panel   3 b) .   Moreover, the speed of the   atmospheric pr essure wave  propagation   at a n y   atmospheric pressure sensor station   can also be estimated . In this   paper ,   the  average speed ,   𝑐 ̅   ( 𝑡 ) , is   calculated   by   dividing   the distance   from the source to   the atmospheric  pressure station   by the   travel time , which   is the time when the   atmospheric   pressure   signal   first  crosses the 0.001 hPa mark   ahead of the arrival of   the first pressure peak.   The   initial time   of the  event is set   at 04 : 15   on   15th   of   January   2022 .   The estimated   average   wave celerity of the pressure  wave   as a function of   the distance from the volcano   is   plotted in   the left panel of   Figure 4 ,   showing  that t he atmospheric pressure speeds up quickly in the near field and reaches a constant value of  ~319 m/s .   The right panel   of   Figure 4 shows the same datapoints , but   as a function   of the time  elapsed from the explosion , based on the arrival (i.e., travel) time   defin ition.

Based on the available   data ,   a n empirical atmospheric pressure wave model in the spherical  coordinate   s ystem   is proposed   as follows:  𝑝 ! ( 𝑟 ,   𝑡 )   =   𝐴 , 𝑋 " ( 𝑡 ) .

Using the spherical coordinate system   in terms of   longitude  and latitude ( ψ 1 ,   φ 1 ) ,   the   great - circle   distance between   the target   location   and   the   position   of Hunga  Tonga - Hunga Ha'apai Volcano ( ψ 0   = 1 75.39° W ,   φ 0 =   20.546° S )   is   calculated   as :  𝑟   =   2 𝑅   arcsin   C D sin $ ( ' ! ( ' "  $   )   +   cos ( 𝜑 " )   cos ( 𝜑 & )   sin $ ( ) ! ( ) "  $   ) H ,   ( 4 )  i n which,   R   is the Earth radius (6.371×10 6   m ).  A s   indicated in   E quation (1), t he   atmospheric p ressure is   modeled   as the product of two  functions .   The shape function,   N ( r,   t )   in   E quation (2), prescribes the N - wave shape (see   Tadepalli  and   Synolakis , 1994).   The   amplitude function ,   A ( X 1 ( t )) ,   provid es   the variations   for the peak and  trough   pressure   values ,   as a function of   the distance   X 1 ( t ) .   As   defined in   E quation (3) ,   X 1 ( t )   can

# Page 9

In the shape function,   ϒ  represents   the wavenumber, defined as   ϒ   =   2 π / L ,   with   L   being   the wavelength   (in meters)   of the  N - wav e .   According to the measured data   at the selected stations   the wavelength s   range from 800  to 1 , 050 km   ( Amores   et al., 2022; Lynett et al., 2022 ) .   For simplicity, in the present model,   a  constant   average   wavelength   of   900   k m   is adopted .   We have performed sensitivity   analyses   using  larger   and   smaller wavelength s ,   which   lead to   insignificant   variations   and equ ally good fit   in terms  of   the free surface elevation .  As illustrated in Figure   3 , the   crests and   t roughs of atmospheric   pressure   wave s   decay at  different rate s .   Accordingly,   the   amplitude   function s,   A ( X 1 ( t )) ,   for the   crest   and the trough   of the  atmospheric pressure waves   are   determined separately by   fitting curves through the measurements.  T hese   empirical   function s can be expressed as :  𝐴   =   I  340   tanh $   L   * ! ( % )  #&& , &&& M   L * ! ( % )  " , &&& M ( & . /  𝑖𝑓   𝑁 ( 𝑟 ,   𝑡 )   >   0 ,   for wave crest ,  450   L * ! ( % )  " , & && M ( & . 0  𝑖𝑓   𝑁 ( 𝑟 ,   𝑡 )   <   0 ,   for wave trough .  ( 5 )  Note   that   the   R 2   values for the fitted curves are 0.8606 and 0.8747 for wave crest and wave trough  amplitudes , respectively.   E quations   (5) yield the   pressure   amplitudes in hPa, wh ile   the distance  X 1 ( t )   is in meters.   T he   propagation distance   X 1   is   obtained from Equation (3)   as   a simple product  using the average speed.   As shown in Figure 4, the   average atmospheric   wave celerity can be  obtained by curve - fitting   too   and represented by  𝑐 ̅   ( 𝑡 )   =   319   tanh ( 𝑡 / 2200 )   ( 6 )  which yields a velocity in m/s when   the   time is in seconds.  To illustrate the   accuracy of the empirical atmospheric pressure model, we have   selected  measured   time series d ata at   18 stations , ranging   from the near field to the far - field ,   for comparison  as shown in Figure   5 .   The comparisons for the rest of stations are presented in   Figure S1 in   the  supplementary materials.   The   modeled   atmospheric   pressure wave s   preserve the arrival time and  the main wa ve   shape   very well. However, the model ignores the trailing oscillatory wave  components.   In the far field,   larger   difference s   in arrival time   appear   due to the inhomogeneity of

No rmally,   the  DART   buoy   record s   the   sea   elevation   data every 15 minutes .   However, w hen the buoy detect s   a  tsunami or   abnormal   sea level   fluctuations , the sampling   rate   in crease s   to 1 minute or 15 seconds  ( Meinig   et al., 2005) .   Since the   DART system measures the sea surface elevation   using   a   bottom -  mounted   pressure recorder ,   its measurements ( 𝜁 ) include both   atmospheric   pressure fluctuations  ( 𝑃 ! ) an d the sea   level   variation ( 𝜂 )   ( Rabinovich   and   Eblé , 2015 ),  𝜁   =   𝜂   +   1 #  23   (7)  where   𝜌   is the density of seawater and   g   is the   gravitational   acceleration .   When tsunami   waves  are generated by an earthquake, the atmospheric pressure variations are negligible and the reported  measurement ( 𝜁 ) is the same as the sea level variation ( 𝜂 ).   Moreover, DART stations do not record

However, since   the  atmospheric   pressure fluctuation s   induced   by the   Tong a   volcano eruption   are   significant   and the  leading wave   is   “locked”   in phase   with the   atmospheric   pressure wave,   the DART   reported   data  must   be corrected to   isolate   the   actual   tsunami wave s . Based on the   analysis of Liu and   Higuera  (2022), the formula to   approximately   correct the DART measurements   can be expressed as  𝜂   =   "  4 $  %   𝜁 ,   (8)  i n which   F r   is   the   local   Froude number at   the   DART buoy   location , calculated   as  𝐹 5   =   6  7 38 ,   (9)  where   c   is the speed of   the   atmospheric   pressure   wave , which is fixed,   and   d   is   the local water  depth.   It can be observed that the correction method is   dependent on   the   local water depth, and  results in a reduction of the DART reported data   for   F r   > 1 , which is the case fo r the Tonga event .  Moreover, this reduction   ( Equation   8)   is   lin early proportional to the water depth, thus,   the   formula  will produce a relatively larger correction in   shallower water s .  Figure 6 shows the location of the DART buoy stations across the Pacific Ocean (panel a) and  corrected and un - corrected time series of   free surface elevations at 4 selected DART buoy stations  (panels b~e).   The se stations have been selected because the   water depths   cover a wide range:   1,807  m (DART52406), 3,273 m (DART32411), 4,230 m (DART46409) and 5,742 m (DART G),  respectively.   To correct   the DART data,   the   atmospheric   pressure at   the   DART bu oy   location   is  first estimated   using   the empirical atmospheric pressure model.   The   duration   of the   atmospheric  pressure wave   is extracted   and   use d   as a mask   to correct the DART data   only   within   the relevant  window   (shown in grey line) ,   using   E quation   8 .   T he   speed s   of atmospheric pressure wave   at each  station   are   cal culated, which   in this case   are   almost a   constant   (~   319 m/s ), since these stations are  f a rther than 1 , 0 0 0 km from Tonga . Therefore,   the Froude number   at these buoys   range s   from 1.32  ( DART52406 )   to 2.4   ( DART G ) , depending on the local water depths .   The blue line   is   the  original ly reported   DART   data   and t he black line denotes the corrected   time series , i.e.,   the actual  tsunami   free surface elevation .   It can be observed that, as   mentioned before, the   relative reduction  is   larger for shallower water depths . P anels b~e in Fi gure 6   are arranged   in terms of   increasing  water   depths.   Therefore, the most significant reduction occurs for DART 52406, from   3.8   cm of  positive wave amplitude reported to   0.7   cm after the correction.

The upper panel (a)   shows   the locations of the DART  buoys   in the   Pacific Ocean . The lower panel s   show   the time ser ies of the surface elevation of four buoys ,  arranged in terms of increasing water depths,   before   (blue line)   and after   (black line)   the   correction   has  been applied   within the grey   window .  2 . 3   Numerical Model  T he   numerical   model   FUNWAVE   (Shi et al., 2012; Kirby et al., 2013)   has been   adopted for  simulating   tsunami   generation and   propagation   using the   linear shallow water equations   (LSWE) .  In   the   spherical coordinates,   the   LSWE   are written as,  (1 0 )  ( 11 )  ( 12 )  where   M   and   N   are the   volume   fluxes in the   longitude ( ψ )   and   latitude ( φ )   directions,   respectively,  and   f   is the Coriolis force .  In the numerical model,   the   bathymetry data   has been   obtained from the ETOPO1 global relief  model   at   1 arcmin resolution. The computational domain   spans from   100 °   E   to   1 20 °   W ,   and from  7 0 ° S   to   7 0 ° N (Figure 1), which   covers   the entire   Pacific Ocean regi on . The grid size is   4   arcmin  (~ 3 , 6 00 m) ,   and   the   total grid cell   count   is   6.3 million .   The time step is   6   s,   which is small enough  to satisfy the CFL condition.   The propagation of   the   atmospheric pressure and   the resulting   tsunami  waves are   simulated for 20 hours from the volcanic explosion   using   48 cores ,   and the simulations  take   4 . 6   hours   on a   2.4   GHz Xeon workstation .   Additional   grid refinement   sensitivity   tests have  been carried out   based on grid resolution s   of 2 arcmin, 4 arcmin and 8 arcmin , respectively .   For  the 2 arcmin grid resolution, t he sensitivity analysis could not be completed   because   significant  numerical instabilities   are observed . Nevertheless,   the   comparisons between the 4 and 8 arcmin  grids   in dicated that   they   produced   the same results in the near field and   only   slight   difference s  were   observed   in the far - field.   In the end, the 4 arcmin grid is adopted in this study.  𝜕 𝜂  𝜕𝑡   +   1  𝑅 cos 𝜑   b 𝜕𝑀  𝜕 𝜓   +   𝜕  𝜕 𝜑   ( cos 𝜑 𝑁 ) e   =   0  𝜕𝑀  𝜕𝑡   +   𝑔𝑑  𝑅 cos 𝜑  𝜕𝜂  𝜕 𝜓   −   𝑓𝑁   =   −   𝑑  𝜌𝑅 cos 𝜑  𝜕𝑝 𝑎  𝜕 𝜓  𝜕𝑁  𝜕𝑡   +   𝑔𝑑  𝑅  𝜕𝜂  𝜕 𝜑   +   𝑓𝑀   =   −   𝑑  𝜌𝑅  𝜕𝑝 𝑎  𝜕 𝜑

The top panel   (a)   shows a sequence of the   circular atmospheric pressure  waves, being prescribed by the empirical N - wave model in Equation 1, which   propagat e   across  the Pacific Ocean   at   a speed   of   ~319 m /s . The amplitude   of   the   atmospheric   pressure decrease s

Six hours after the explosion ,  the   amplitude has reduced to approximately   1 hPa , and after   10 h ours,   the atmospheric pressure  wave   is already propagating away from the Pacific Ocean. The atmospheric pressure waves will  eventually circle around the Earth a nd return to the Pacific Ocean several times. However, the  present empirical model is only applicable to the initial stage covering the   first pass over the   Pacific  Ocean.  The panel (b) in   Figure   7 shows the corresponding snapshots of the   simulated   tsunami   waves  in the Pacific Ocean. The tsunami waves originate   in the vicinity the volcano, where the amplitude  is significantly larger due to the large   atmospheric pressure   in the near - field, which decays fast, as  mentioned before. The snapshots of the tsunami   at 1 h and 2 h show that the tsunami wave heights  to   the   E ast of Tonga are larger than those to the   W est. This is due to Proudman resonance condition  occurring over the Tonga Trench, where the Froude number   𝐹𝑟   =   9  7 3 : , is close to the critical  condition.   This point will be further discussed in Section 3.3.   From the rest of the snapshots in  Figure   7   ( b ) , it is clear that the area of influence of the tsunami waves is always confined within  the reach of atmospheric pressure waves,   because   the leadi ng wave is the fastest - travelling one  and is locked to the   atmospheric   pressure wave. At 6 h, the leading and trailing tsunami waves are  easily distinguished, since the separation between them is approximately 2,350 km, which is more  than   twice   the wavelen gth. The higher wave heights continue to propagate towards America, where  the highest waves from among the far - field locations were recorded. Interestingly, some waves can  be distinguished in the Caribbean Sea in the last panel. These have been generated b y the  atmospheric pressure wave, after it has propagated over Central America, which acts as a barrier  for the waves that were produced on the Pacific Ocean.  Figure   8   illustrate s   the c omparison s   of the   corrected DART data   (black line)   and simulated  numeric al   results   (red line) , arranged   from the near - field to the far - field   stations .   The locations of  these stations can be found in Figure 6 (a).   The gray arrow marks the arrival of the   leading   locked  wave.   The   b lue dash   vertical   line   indicates   the   expected   arrival   time of the   trailing   free   wave ,  which is   calculated as   the   distance from Tonga   to the station   over the   estimated   long   wave speed  of 756 km/h, calculated   for   a constant   average depth of 4 , 500 m , representative of the Pacific  Ocean .   We   note   t he   arrival   time s   of   the   locked and free   wave s   in the near - field (e.g. ,   DART G)   are  almost   simultaneous ,   because the speed of   propagation of   the   atmospheric   pressure   wave   is   small

The separation   (i.e.,  difference in   arrival time s)   between the   leading   locked wave and the free   wave increases with the  distance   to   the   DART   station   ( Liu and Higuera ,   2022) .  Generally,   the   simulat ion   results   match   reasonably   well   with   the   corrected   DART  measurements , both   in terms of the arrival time and amplitude of the leading wave . Yet,   some  differences   are clearly observed . In the near - field, at DART G,   t he   tsunami wave   has a   very deep  trough   compared to the crest , matching the   initial   shape of the shock wave   (see Figure s   3   and 5 ) .  After the   leading   wave,   the trailing   wave s   contain   higher frequency   wave s ,   which are not  reproduced by   the numerical model.   The same   feature   can be observed   at other stations   in the near -  field   (e.g.,   F, 51425 , K,   D , etc. ) .   T he se   short wave s   may   have   be en   produced   by   other   tsunami  generation   mechanism s   aside from the   atmospheric   pressure wave   (e.g.,   the collapse of the  volcanic caldera ) ,   which have not been   considered   in this w ork . This   hypothesis seems to be  confirmed   by the fact that high frequency waves   are captured   to some extent   in Lynett et al. ’s  (2022) simulation s , which   accounts for the local wave generation mechanisms . This last point   will  be further discussed in   appendix B .   At   DA RT   A ,   which is   approximately   2,500   km   from the source,  the leading wave is well captured   in terms of shape and phase ,   but   significant differences   are  noticeable   in the trailing   free waves. The   general characte ristics of the   numerical   results are in  accordance with the analytical   solutions   of Liu and Higuera (2022),   namely,   the   leading   locked  wave   is led by   a crest and the   trailing   free   wave   by   a trough .   T he   measured   trailing wave does not  exhibit   high - frequency wave components   at this particular location,   suggesting   that   the   tsunami  waves   generated by   the additional   mechanisms may not propagate in all directions equally, and are  perhaps influenced by blocking effects or diffraction due to islands,   or by preferential propagation  directions due to the bathymetry.   A t this and   many other   locations   the wave amplitudes are smaller  than   5 cm in height, which highlights the high sensitivity of the DART system.  In the mid - range - field   (Figure   8   (b), 3 , 000~6 , 000 km) ,   the   simulated   leading wave amplitude s  and arrival time s   generally match well with the measurements.   Major differences   can be   found   at  DART 51407 ,   in which large   high - frequency   waves   are observed   in the field but   absent in the  numerical   results .  T he   analysis of the   far - field   has been split into three areas.   I n the   N orthwest Pacific Ocean  region (Figure   8 c), the   numerical   results match   especially   well with the measurements   for the

# Page 18

These are most likely   associated with   the  additional free waves   generated by   the   interaction of   locked wave s   with   changing bathymetry .   In  the   N ortheast   Pacific Ocean   (Figure   8 d) ,   the situation is almost identical, but the trailing waves  are larger than   those in   the   Northwest   Pacific Ocean region . In the   S outheast Pacific ( i.e.,   South  America , Figure   7 e) , the separation of the leading   locked waves and   trai ling   free   wave s   is   more  obvious   than in   other regions ,   because the propagation distance s are longer   (Liu and Higuera,  2022) . Besides, the   amplitude of the trailing waves is significantly larger than that of the leading  waves. The   main   reason   is that   the   DART   locations are almost 10,000 km away from Tonga, and  the   atmospheric   pressure wave s   ha ve   decay ed significantly , producing   a   small leading   locked   wave.  Moreover ,   the trailing   free   waves are   largely   amplified when the   atmospheric   pressure tr avel s   over  Tonga’s Trench   ( which has a   maximum depth of approximately 10, 000   m ),   approaching   Proudman  resonance   conditions   (Proudman, 1929) , as will be explained in   more   detail   in a later section .

The distance  between the DART station and   the   source of   the   explosion   is   color - coded according to the   color  scale   shown   on   the   first   panel .   The   results   indicate that the numerical model produced accurate  solutions for the   arrival time, with a   coefficient of determination   of R 2   =   0.99 94 .   This result is not  surprising, since the leading wave is “locked” to the   atmospheric   pressure wave , for which the  propagation speed has been derived from observations (see Figure   4 ).   The   amplitudes of   the  leading wave crest   and trough   at most DART buoys ar e less than 0.04 m ,   and   they   decrease from  the near - field to the far - field.   The R 2   values are   0.75   and 0.78 for the wave crest and trough  amplitudes ,   respectively,   when compared with the corrected DART data,   indicating   that   the  numerical results are   acceptable   in terms of the correlation .   Comparisons with the uncorrected data  yield a slightly higher correlation   in terms of R 2   (8% and 3%   higher ), but also significantly larger  root mean square errors (RMSE, 98% and 47%   higher than for the corrected resu lts, respectively ) ,  indicating   that the numerical simulation and the simple correction method proposed in Liu and  Higuera (2022) provide reasonable results .

Top panels   are   the   comparisons  against   corrected DART data and   bottom panels   against   uncorrected   DART data.  3.2 Wavelet analysis  U sing the Morlet   ( Gaussian - windowed sinusoid )   Continuous W avelet   Transformation (CWT)  analysis,   the   time   evolution of the dominant wave components of the free surface elevation at  selected DART stations   are presented in Figure   10 .   The stations   (a - f),   are ar ranged based on  increasing distance to Tonga, from top to bottom. T he   wavelet   results based on the   corrected DART  data   are   shown in the   left   column   and the   results   based on   the   numerical   simulations   are   given   in  the   right   column .   The arrival time of   the   leading wave is   marked   with a   white   dashed   line , while  the white   continuous   line represents the   estimated   arrival time of the trailing wave. The arrival  time of the trailing wave   at DART buoy (G) is not shown because   it is almost   concurrent to   the  leading wave, as this location   is very close to the volcano.   At the DART buoy (G) ,   the dominant  wave   period s   rang e   from 10 to   64   minutes   initially . Additional components with periods of   5  minutes and   shorter appear   later ,   1 hour from the   explosion,   as   the energy contained in higher  period waves reduces progressively , almost disappearing 2 hours after the event .   From this point  on,   the “ringing”   effect for high - frequency waves   becomes   intermittent and   continues for several  hours .   The numeri cal results are only able to capture the low frequency waves , with a slightly  smaller block (15   –   40 minutes) centered   around the 28 minutes period,   since   additional wave  generation mechanisms have not been   considered in   the   present   model. This situation can be  observed in all   subsequent   numerical modelling results, which lack short period waves below ~15  minutes.   Moreover, the numerical results at DART G s how   an additional long period component  at 70 minutes, with higher energy content, when compared to the field data.   A common factor  between the DART data and the numerical model data   at DART G (the closest to the volcano)   is  that   energy   exists before the a rrival of the leading wave. However,   these   points appear in both  panels, and   lie outside the cone of influence of the CWT   (yellow curved dashed line) . For those  reasons, they should be considered as an energy “leakage” instead of actual long wave condition s  at the site prior to the explosion.  Based on the results , the numerical simulation   based on the simple atmospheric model   can  successfully   reproduce   in a qualitative way   the longer period waves (40 minutes at DART 51425,

# Page 22

Confidential manuscript submitted to   Jou rnal of Geophysical Research: Oceans  22  56 minutes at DART 46407 and 40 - 69   minutes at DART 32401), leading or trailing .   This  conclusion is consistent with the observations already made for Figure   8 .   Generally, the agreement  is higher in terms of the starting times (relative location within the figure) than in the magnitude  ( colo r scale ) .   However, in some instances , such as   close to Tonga (DART G, 51425) and   in the  N orthwest Pacific Ocean   (DART 21420), the differences are significant, especially when  comparing the components with   a   higher energy   content .   In fact, the field observations of DART  51425 highlight the extreme complexity of this event in the near field, since model fails to capt ure  most of the higher energy components at this location, especially after the trailing waves arrive.  This is no t a   surprise, since   as already mentioned,   higher frequency waves are not included in the  source model. As we move f ar ther away from the source,   the leading and trailing waves are further  separated in   time,   and it is easier to observe the differences between them .   The amplitude of the  leading wave decreases with distance, which is reflected in the CWT results. Moreover, the leading  wave tends to p roduce long waves only, and little or no shorter wave components. In some  instances (e.g., DART 21420) lower period components arrive before the trailing wave arrival time ,  which means that these must have been produced locally or closer to the DART buoy l ocation  rather than at the volcano, due to their slower celerity.   These   are likely to have   have been   produced  by wave scattering (i.e., free wave creation) as the locked wave propagates over the changing  bathymetry , by the mechanisms explained in Vennell ( 2007) . Given that the model   solution   does  not capture the se   short - wave   components   ( e.g.,   compare both   panel s in row   d),   the main   hypothes i s  is that they may require a finer mesh to be reproduced. However, the finer mesh   tested led to  numerical instabilities, so this point could not be verified.   On top of this,   components with shorter  wavelengths are more susceptible to dispersive effects. Ther efore, LSWE may not suffice to  represent them accurately, in which case more sophisticated types of equations, as for example  Boussinesq equations, would be required.   An analysis on the dispersion effects   for the present  model   will be presented in   appendix   A .   Finally, after the trailing wave arrival time ,   long and short  waves seem to be equally important . This is because the free wave produced by the atmospheric  pressure travels at the same celerity as long waves produced by additional mechanisms. G enerally ,  the longer period components arriv e   slightly earlier. However, this   perception   may be   slightly  exacerbated by the characteristics   inherent to   the CWT , which spreads energy over a longer time  for longer periods, due to the   longer   length of the wavelet   use d in   the analysis of longer periods .

(a) Overall maximum  amplitudes; (b) maximum amplitudes of the leading wave; ( c ) maximum amplitudes of the trailing wave.  Tonga’s volcano denoted by a black star. The dashed line marks the location after which the leading and  trailing waves are   fully separated.  T he   spatial   distribution of the maximum   (positive)   tsunami amplitude   in the Pacific Ocean  numerical simulation   is presented in Figure 11.   Panel   ( a )   shows   the   global maximum   throughout  the   numerical   simulation ,   while   panel s   ( b ) and ( c ) present the maximum   values   associated   with  the leading and trailing waves, respectively.   Therefore, panel (a)   can be viewed as   the maximum  among panels ( b ) and ( c ).   To separate   the influence of the leading and trailing waves, panel ( b )  records the maxim a   at locations ,   which are within the influence of the pressure disturbance   (r   >

Confidential manuscript submitted to   Jou rnal of Geophysical Research: Oceans  25  X 1 ( t )   –   L/2   , with L being the wavelength, 900 km ) , whereas panel ( c ) records   the maxima  elsewhere.   Both the leading and trailing waves are produced at the same time   and location (the  explosion at the volcano )   but   propagate at different celerities and the distance between them  increases progressively . Thus, there is an area   near Tonga   in which they over lap, which is   bounded  by the dashed line circle.   At any location outside the circle, which has a radius of approximately  2,200 km   ( based on   the pressure wave celerity, 319 m/s, free wave celerity, 198 m/s, and  wavelength, 900 km) , the leading and trailing   waves can be perfectly distinguished.  The wave amplitudes linked to the leading wave , shown in panel ( b ),   are significantly larger  in the near - field , where the   atmospheric   pressure is higher (see Figure 3 ) . T he maximum amplitude  measured   is approximately 10 cm.   The area with the highest amplitudes is linked to   the   Tonga  trench , where the   depth   is   in the excess of 10,000 m   (see the dark shade of blue line east of Tonga  in Figure 1) . Therefore,   the   local   wave celerity   of   the free waves   over   the trench   is   roughly   313  m/s , while   the   speed of   atmospheric pressure   waves   is   about   319 m/s, producing   a   Froude number  very close to 1 (the critical condition) , which is commonly associated with the   Proudman  resonance   condition (Proudman, 1929) .   This effectively translates in an increase of the rate at  which the atmospheric pressure disturbance transfers energy to the   sea , which   in turn produces   a  higher response of the free surface   (i.e., larger waves).   In addition, locked waves propagating over  steep bathymetry features (e.g., ridges and trenches) are known to produce scattering of free waves  (Ven n ell, 2007 ). These   two processes   can explain the fact that the wave height is   significantly  larger in the vicinity of Tonga’s trench in panel (b) , and e specially on the east side , which is  “downstream”.  Regarding the tsunami wave amplitude associated with the trailing waves, shown in panel ( c ),  it is clear that the amplification effect over the Tonga Trench plays a significant role in the large  amplitudes   observed in the South e ast Pacific   as well . The amplitudes of the trailing waves in the  North - West   Pacific are negligible (generally smaller than that of the leading wave). Since the  pressure forcing function is perfectly uniform in   space and   extends as a   perfect circle with its center  at Tonga, this indicates that the trailing wave produced initially by the pressure model is not likely  to have produced the large waves in the South - East Pacific. Instead, it is highly likely that those  have been produced by   the free scattered waves generated as the pressure wave propagates over  Tonga Trench instead   (Vennell, 2007) , as just mentioned . These free waves travel at the long wave  celerity, which is slower than the pressure wave celerity   and progressively separate from it .

# Page 26

Confidential manuscript submitted to   Jou rnal of Geophysical Research: Oceans  26  Moreover , because they have been generated some time after the explosion and   some distance  away from Tonga, their   expected   arrival   time   is still   prior to   the   expected   (original)   trailing wave  arrival.   Therefore, wave sc attering   is most likely the reason why in Figure   8   some of the stations  present significant waves arriving after the leading wave, but before the expected arrival time of  the trailing wave.   Moreover, it can   also   be observed that in the   North w est   Pacific, w hich is free  from the effects of Tonga Trench, the highest amplitude overall is produced by the leading wave.  In addition to the larger wave heights in the   South e ast   Pacific, panel (a) presents interesting  finger - like features in which the maximum   wave   amp litude is larger. Upon closer inspection, these  may have been produced by wave concentration due to the bathymetry features. For example, the  south - most   feature appears to correlate with the location of the Louiseville Ridge, east of New  Zealand. The finge rs channeling wave energy east   are likely enhanced by the Manihiki Plateau  (2,500 m water depth in an area that is almost 5,000 m deep), the Tuamotu Archipelago , before  following the Sala y Gomez and Nazca ridges towards the coasts of Peru , where two peopl e  drowned and an oil - spill occurred due to the 2 m high tsunami waves.  Figure 1 2   Distribution of the maximum tsunami amplitudes of the leading wave based on the  formulation in Liu and Higuera (2022) . See Figure 11 caption for further context .  It is well known that   under simple conditions (i.e., constant water depth,   shallow water   wav e  regime)   the   ocean   locked wave   has the same shape   as the pressure wave , and its   amplitude is

Applying this expression   considering the maximum posi tive amplitude of the pressure  model   as a function of the distance to Tonga   (Equation 5) and the local depth at each point in space  to calculate the amplification factor, a simple estimator of the leading wave positive amplitude can  be constructed.   The the oretical distribution of the maximum leading wave is shown in Figure 12.  We remark that this is a crude approximation , since   it assumes   an immediate response of the water  and   there are additional   physical processes   such as wave scattering, s hoaling , refraction,  diffraction, etc., which are not captured .   The processes, however,   are   correctly   captured by the  numerical simulation. Consequently, it   interesting to compare   Figure 12   with panel (b) in Figure  11   to evaluate   the main differences .  To start with, a large a mplification   factor   of approximately 25   is obtained over Tonga’s Trench,  leading to the largest theoretical amplitudes of the locked wave, exceeding 1 m.   Other trenches,  like Mariana, Japan and Kuril, locate d   in the Pacific Nortwest , also show potential large wave  heights   due to the same mechanisms. However, pressure has decayed significantly by the time it  reaches those locations, leading to lower wave heights overall.   Despite , the   shortcomings of th e  simplifi ed analysis , the comparison with panel (b) in Figure 11 presents similarities. The main  differences occur inside the   dashed line circle, where the locked and free waves overlap, and where  wave scattering is significant. Because of this, the wave heights in   the vicinity of Tonga (black  star) are much larger in the numerical model solution.   At the east side of Tonga’s Trench, the degree  of similarity increases, although the   numerical model solutions present a larger wave over a wider  geographical area, for th e aforementioned reasons.   Outside the circle, where the influence of the  leading wave can be isolated from the effects of the trailing waves, the degree of similarity is  outstanding, matching not only in terms of the general patterns, but also in terms of   the final  amplitude. Therefore,   it can be concluded that the analytical model of   Liu and Higuera (2022) is  applicable to real conditions, especially   in areas with small bathymetry gradients .

The  empirical model was calibrated with field measurements .   The   atmospheric   pressure crest  amplitude   increases   from   the source in the   near field , then decreases slowly   moving aways from  the source .   On the other hand,   the   trough   amplitude   of the atmospheric   pressure   decreases   quickly  from the source   in   the near - field,   and then slowly   in the far - field . The   propagation   speed   of the  atmospheric pressure   increases   in the near - field   and   becomes   a constant speed of 319 m/s   at   about  1 , 000 km from the volcano.   The method suggested by Liu and Higuera (2022) is adopted to correct  the DART measurement s to exclude   the   atmospheric   pressure   influence in the signal for the free  surface elevation .  B ased on the   LSWE   model, the simulat ed tsunami waves   results   match   reasonably   well with  the corrected DART measurements in terms of the tsunami arrival time and tsunami   amplitude  from the near - field to the far - field , especially for the leading wave   and   most   parts of the trailing  wave.   However, the   short - wave components   of the trailing wave s,   which   could   p ossib ly   be  generated   by   an other   generation   mechanism , cannot be capt ured by the present numerical model.  The wavelet analysis   for the corrected DART data and the numerical results supports this point.  We   successfully separate the tsunami leading wave and trailing wave numerically and   theoretically .  The larger   atmospheric   pressure amplitude and Tonga Trench increase the tsunami leading wave  in the near field. The   amplification effect   induced by   Tonga Trench plays a n important   role in the  large amplitudes in the South e ast Pacifi c.   We   also   investigate d   the   importa nce of the frequency  dispersion effect. The results show that the dispersion effect   is minor for the 2022 Tonga event ,  due to its long   wavelength of 900 km.   We further c ompar e d   our results   with Lynett et al.   (2022) ’s  model ,   as we   have applied   similar   metho d.   B oth models capture the pressure forcing mechanism,  including   the trailing waves in the far - field.   This   indicates that a   significant   part of the trailing  wave s is   induced by the atmospheric shock wave.   In   conclusion, the method suggested in the study  could explain the tsunami generation and propagation generated by the 2022 Tonga volcano  eruption in the Pacific   O cean. Nevertheless, the   other possible mechanism s   should   be investigated  to explain the trailin g wave s   with short er   period s .

In this study, the   characteristic   wavelength   L   is 900,000 m and the average  water depth is approximately 4,500 m, which is representative of the Pacific Ocean. The effects of  wave fre quency dispersion accumulate in time/space. Therefore, according to Glimsdal et al.  (2013), if   τ   < 0.01 ,   the dispersion effects   are   small, and if   τ   >   0.1 ,   the dispersion effects   become  significant.   For a propagation distance of 10,000 km, which is the ord er of magnitude of   the width  of   the Pacific Ocean,   τ   is 0.0016. This   suggests already   that the   frequency   dispersion effect s   for  the Tonga event   are expected to be negligible.  The time series of the surface elevation at two DART buoys in the far - field   comp aring the  dispersive and non - dispersive simulations   are plotted in   Figure   13 . The results show minor  differences only, with deviations being less than 6%. This indicates that the dispersion effect can  be safely ignored when simulating the wave driven by the moving pressure in the 2022 Tonga  tsunami event, since the pressure shock   wave is a very long wave. This conclusion, however, does  not hold when reproducing the other wave generation mechanisms. The additional mechanisms  produce significantly shorter waves, as has been   shown   in Lynett et al. (2022). Therefore, shorter  waves will   be more affected because they travel a longer distance relative to their wavelength, as  will be further discussed in the next section.

(2022)   have   presented an alternative model to describe the atmospheric pressure  and   numerical simulations of   the induced tsunami. The atmospheric pressure wave is formulated  by defining the crest and trough independently to produce the distinctive N - wave shape. The crest  and trough present the same basic shape (exponential curves decaying with the square of the p hase),  but each one has its own amplitude, celerity and wavelength (or wave period). These   three   are  functions   of   time and that have been   found using   the   available atmospheric   pressure data. Lynett  et al. (2022) adopted pressure data obtained from 134 weat her stations with a sampling frequency  of 6 - 10 minutes, located all around the globe.   Thus, the measurements from some of those stations  may be affected by the surrounding topographical features, unlike those carefully selected in this  work.   Lynett et al’s   model offers a high flexibility, with 6 main parameters, and can account for  the changes in   wavelength   of the pressure wave. In contrast, the model proposed   in this paper  ( Equations 1 - 6 )   offers only 3 parameters (the amplitudes of crest and trough and the   joint celerity),  considering a constant wavelength.  Apart   from   the differences   in the empirical atmospheric models , there are significant  differences in the simulation procedure , as follows.   On the one hand, w hile   Lynett et al.’s model  adopted   a   Cartesian coordinate   s ystem   based on the azimuthally equidistant projection, the present  model uses spherical coordinates , which is a   more physical   representation   of reality .   In addition ,  we have accounted for   Coriolis force .   On the other hand,   Lynett et a l.’s model considered  additional wave generation mechanisms (e.g., caldera collapse) on top of the atmospheric pressure  wave, which introduce shorter waves in the system, whereas the present model only considers the  latter .   As a result, Lynett et al.’s mod el   is   based on the Boussinesq equations,   which   account for  the   frequency   dispersion effect, while the present model adopts a (non - dispersive)   LSWE   model.  In order to allow a direct comparison between the performance of both models, Lynett et al.’s  results   have been analyzed and presented in Figure   1 4 , which can be   directly compared with Figure  9 . In both cases the arrival time data is virtually the same, and very close to a perfect fit. Regarding  crest and trough amplitudes, the R 2   is very similar or slightly better in   Lynett et al.’s (2022) case,  while the   root mean square error ( RMSE ) metrics   are higher by approximately 20% and 60%   than

# Page 32

However, Lynett et al.’s (2022) data includes only 18 points , so any outlier will   have  more relative weight , whereas in this work we have compared data from 41 DART stations.  Figure 1 4 .

Comparison of time series of free surface elevation between   present   results (red line), Lynett  et al.’s (2022) results (blue line) and the corrected DART data (black line).  We have also compared the time series of   free   surface elevation between   the pres ent   numerical  simulation   results   (red line) and Lynett et al.’s (2022) results (blue line), as shown in Figure   1 5 . In  the near field (DART G), both solutions are very similar in terms of the long - wave component s.  However,   Lynett et al.’s solution s   present noticeable shorter wave components arriving 50 minutes  after the volcanic explosion, which are likely produced by the additional mechanisms included in  their model. Nevertheless, these shorter waves do not match with the   arrival time observed in the  field, which happens approximately 25 minutes later. In the mid - field, the amplitude s   of the crest  and trough of the leading wave for both models in DART 51407   are   very similar, and slightly  higher   than   the DART corrected data.   However, the arrival time from Lynett et al.’s solution is  well ahead of the observed   arrival   time, whereas the model presented   in this paper   captures   the  arrival time   almost perfectly. The   long - wave component   (i.e.,   trend )   of the trailing waves is also  s imilar in both cases . However,   the present   model   does   not captur e   the high - frequency waves (as  expected) and Lynett et al.’s results   show   a later arrival and a smaller   amplitude   than in the field  data. Also in the mid - range, DART 21419, neither model prese nt s   accurate results, especially after  the first waves , reflecting the complexity of the real world problem.  Finally, in the far - field (DART 32402) both models produce similar   results and   are able to  model the arrival time of the trailing waves accurately , capturing their large amplitudes to a great  extent.   This   suggests   that the trailing   free   waves are   produced at the different stages   and locations  during the simulation ,   when   the locked waves   travel over the changing bathymetry, as has already  been   discussed.   T he   additional wave generation mechanisms (e.g., caldera collapse)   have some  impact on the   solutions, especially in the short - wave range in the near - field, but are likely to have
