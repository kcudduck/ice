Xi(t) — L/2 , with L being the wavelength, 900 km), whereas panel (c¢) records the maxima
elsewhere. Both the leading and trailing waves are produced at the same time and location (the
explosion at the volcano) but propagate at different celerities and the distance between them
increases progressively. Thus, there 1s an area near Tonga in which they overlap, which 1s bounded
by the dashed line circle. At any location outside the circle, which has a radius of approximately
2,200 km (based on the pressure wave celerity, 319 m/s, free wave celerity, 198 m/s, and
wavelength, 900 km), the leading and trailing waves can be perfectly distinguished.

The wave amplitudes linked to the leading wave, shown 1n panel (b), are significantly larger
in the near-field, where the atmospheric pressure 1s higher (see Figure 3). The maximum amplitude
measured 1s approximately 10 cm. The area with the highest amplitudes 1s linked to the Tonga
trench, where the depth 1s in the excess of 10,000 m (see the dark shade of blue line east of Tonga
in Figure 1). Therefore, the local wave celerity of the free waves over the trench 1s roughly 313
m/s, while the speed of atmospheric pressure waves 1s about 319 m/s, producing a Froude number
very close to 1 (the critical condition), which 1s commonly associated with the Proudman
resonance condition (Proudman, 1929). This effectively translates in an increase of the rate at
which the atmospheric pressure disturbance transfers energy to the sea, which in turn produces a
higher response of the free surface (i.e., larger waves). In addition, locked waves propagating over
steep bathymetry features (e.g., ridges and trenches) are known to produce scattering of free waves
(Vennell, 2007). These two processes can explain the fact that the wave height 1s significantly
larger 1n the vicinity of Tonga’s trench in panel (b), and especially on the east side, which 1s
“downstream”.

Regarding the tsunami wave amplitude associated with the trailing waves, shown in panel (¢),
it 1s clear that the amplification effect over the Tonga Trench plays a significant role 1n the large
amplitudes observed in the Southeast Pacific as well. The amplitudes of the trailing waves in the
North-West Pacific are negligible (generally smaller than that of the leading wave). Since the
pressure forcing function is perfectly uniform in space and extends as a perfect circle with its center
at Tonga, this indicates that the trailing wave produced initially by the pressure model 1s not likely
to have produced the large waves in the South-East Pacific. Instead, it 1s highly likely that those
have been produced by the free scattered waves generated as the pressure wave propagates over
Tonga Trench instead (Vennell, 2007), as just mentioned. These free waves travel at the long wave
celerity, which 1s slower than the pressure wave celerity and progressively separate from it.
