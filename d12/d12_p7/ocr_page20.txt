measurements 1n Figure 9. The perfect fit line and the £20% error lines are shown. The distance
between the DART station and the source of the explosion 1s color-coded according to the color
scale shown on the first panel. The results indicate that the numerical model produced accurate
solutions for the arrival time, with a coefficient of determination of R?= 0.9994. This result is not
surprising, since the leading wave 1s “locked” to the atmospheric pressure wave, for which the
propagation speed has been derived from observations (see Figure 4). The amplitudes of the
leading wave crest and trough at most DART buoys are less than 0.04 m, and they decrease from
the near-field to the far-field. The R? values are 0.75 and 0.78 for the wave crest and trough
amplitudes, respectively, when compared with the corrected DART data, indicating that the
numerical results are acceptable in terms of the correlation. Comparisons with the uncorrected data
yield a slightly higher correlation in terms of R? (8% and 3% higher), but also significantly larger
root mean square errors (RMSE, 98% and 47% higher than for the corrected results, respectively),
indicating that the numerical simulation and the simple correction method proposed in Liu and
Higuera (2022) provide reasonable results.
