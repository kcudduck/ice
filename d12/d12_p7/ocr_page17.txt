initially and increases to a constant value in the far-field (see Figure 4). The separation (i.e.,
difference 1n arrival times) between the leading locked wave and the free wave increases with the
distance to the DART station (Liu and Higuera, 2022).

Generally, the simulation results match reasonably well with the corrected DART
measurements, both in terms of the arrival time and amplitude of the leading wave. Yet, some
differences are clearly observed. In the near-field, at DART G, the tsunami wave has a very deep
trough compared to the crest, matching the initial shape of the shock wave (see Figures 3 and 5).
After the leading wave, the trailing waves contain higher frequency waves, which are not
reproduced by the numerical model. The same feature can be observed at other stations in the near-
field (e.g., F, 51425, K, D, etc.). These short waves may have been produced by other tsunami
generation mechanisms aside from the atmospheric pressure wave (e.g., the collapse of the
volcanic caldera), which have not been considered in this work. This hypothesis seems to be
confirmed by the fact that high frequency waves are captured to some extent in Lynett et al.â€™s
(2022) simulations, which accounts for the local wave generation mechanisms. This last point will
be further discussed in appendix B. At DART A, which is approximately 2,500 km from the source,
the leading wave 1s well captured in terms of shape and phase, but significant differences are
noticeable in the trailing free waves. The general characteristics of the numerical results are in
accordance with the analytical solutions of Liu and Higuera (2022), namely, the leading locked
wave 1s led by a crest and the trailing free wave by a trough. The measured trailing wave does not
exhibit high-frequency wave components at this particular location, suggesting that the tsunami
waves generated by the additional mechanisms may not propagate in all directions equally, and are
perhaps influenced by blocking effects or diffraction due to islands, or by preferential propagation
directions due to the bathymetry. At this and many other locations the wave amplitudes are smaller
than 5 cm 1n height, which highlights the high sensitivity of the DART system.

In the mid-range-field (Figure 8 (b), 3,000~6,000 km), the simulated leading wave amplitudes
and arrival times generally match well with the measurements. Major differences can be found at
DART 51407, in which large high-frequency waves are observed in the field but absent in the
numerical results.

The analysis of the far-field has been split into three areas. In the Northwest Pacific Ocean
region (Figure 8c), the numerical results match especially well with the measurements for the
