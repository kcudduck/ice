either be defined integrating the instantaneous wave celerity, c(¢), or as a simple product using the
more convenient average speed C, which has been previously defined. In the shape function, V”
represents the wavenumber, defined as Y"= 2z/L, with L being the wavelength (in meters) of the
N-wave. According to the measured data at the selected stations the wavelengths range from 800
to 1,050 km (Amores et al., 2022; Lynett et al., 2022). For simplicity, in the present model, a
constant average wavelength of 900 km 1s adopted. We have performed sensitivity analyses using
larger and smaller wavelengths, which lead to insignificant variations and equally good fit in terms
of the free surface elevation.

As illustrated in Figure 3, the crests and troughs of atmospheric pressure waves decay at
different rates. Accordingly, the amplitude functions, A(Xi(¢)), for the crest and the trough of the
atmospheric pressure waves are determined separately by fitting curves through the measurements.
These empirical functions can be expressed as:

~0.6
340 tanh? (52) (=) if N(r,t) > 0, for wave crest,
’ = 300,000/ \1,000 (5)
450 (0) if N(r,t) <0, for wave trough
1,000 S11
Note that the R? values for the fitted curves are 0.8606 and 0.8747 for wave crest and wave trough
amplitudes, respectively. Equations (5) yield the pressure amplitudes in hPa, while the distance
Xi(t) 1s in meters. The propagation distance X; 1s obtained from Equation (3) as a simple product
using the average speed. As shown 1n Figure 4, the average atmospheric wave celerity can be
obtained by curve-fitting too and represented by
c(t) = 319 tanh(t/2200) (6)
which yields a velocity in m/s when the time 1s 1n seconds.

To illustrate the accuracy of the empirical atmospheric pressure model, we have selected
measured time series data at 18 stations, ranging from the near field to the far-field, for comparison
as shown 1n Figure 5. The comparisons for the rest of stations are presented in Figure S1 1n the
supplementary materials. The modeled atmospheric pressure waves preserve the arrival time and
the main wave shape very well. However, the model 1gnores the trailing oscillatory wave
components. In the far field, larger differences in arrival time appear due to the inhomogeneity of
