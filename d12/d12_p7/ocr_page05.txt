2 Data and Methods
2.1 Atmospheric Pressure Observations and Empirical Model

After Tongaâ€™s volcanic eruption, thousands of Meteorological stations around the world
captured the atmospheric pressure shock wave. These observations could be seriously affected by
the location of the instrument and its surrounding topography. For example, several stations located
in the cities of New Zealand present significantly smaller pressure peaks than those located near
the coast. Moreover, the atmospheric pressure in Santiago de Chile presents overly high values,
which could be caused by the Andes Mountains (reaching 6,500 m above sea level) partially
reflecting the atmospheric pressure wave. Therefore, to construct an empirical atmospheric
pressure model 1n the Pacific Ocean, we select atmospheric pressure stations based on two
principles: (1) The instrument must be located at the coast, and (2) they need to be far from sharp
orographic features (e.g., mountains or valleys).

In total, we have selected 39 stations, as shown in Figure 1, over three regions. The near
field region 1s defined as the area within 3,000 km from Tonga, and comprises 16 stations (Fiji
Meteorological Service, Weather Underground, NIWA), providing atmospheric pressure
measurements with a 5-10 min sampling frequency. The mid-field region 1s within 3,000-6,000
km, and the far-field region 1s farther than 6,000 km from Tonga. There are 43 additional stations
within these two regions, including 10 stations from Japan Soratena, 15 stations from the
Meteorological Directorate of Chile, 2 stations from Taiwan, and 16 stations from the National
Climatic Data Center of USA, providing a 1 min sampling frequency. Higher sampling rates are
more likely to capture the peak values of the atmospheric pressure waves, thus, providing a more
accurate representation of the event.
