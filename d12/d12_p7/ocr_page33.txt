Figure 15. Comparison of time series of free surface elevation between present results (red line), Lynett
et al.’s (2022) results (blue line) and the corrected DART data (black line).

We have also compared the time series of free surface elevation between the present numerical
simulation results (red line) and Lynett et al.’s (2022) results (blue line), as shown in Figure 15. In
the near field (DART G), both solutions are very similar in terms of the long-wave components.
However, Lynett et al.’s solutions present noticeable shorter wave components arriving S50 minutes
after the volcanic explosion, which are likely produced by the additional mechanisms included in
their model. Nevertheless, these shorter waves do not match with the arrival time observed 1n the
field, which happens approximately 25 minutes later. In the mid-field, the amplitudes of the crest
and trough of the leading wave for both models in DART 51407 are very similar, and slightly
higher than the DART corrected data. However, the arrival time from Lynett et al.’s solution 1s
well ahead of the observed arrival time, whereas the model presented in this paper captures the
arrival time almost perfectly. The long-wave component (1.e., trend) of the trailing waves 1s also
similar 1n both cases. However, the present model does not capture the high-frequency waves (as
expected) and Lynett et al.’s results show a later arrival and a smaller amplitude than 1n the field
data. Also in the mid-range, DART 21419, neither model presents accurate results, especially after
the first waves, reflecting the complexity of the real world problem.

Finally, in the far-field (DART 32402) both models produce similar results and are able to
model the arrival time of the trailing waves accurately, capturing their large amplitudes to a great
extent. This suggests that the trailing free waves are produced at the different stages and locations
during the simulation, when the locked waves travel over the changing bathymetry, as has already
been discussed. The additional wave generation mechanisms (e.g., caldera collapse) have some
impact on the solutions, especially in the short-wave range in the near-field, but are likely to have
