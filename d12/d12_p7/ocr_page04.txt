leading to a landslide that generated tsunami waves (Ren et al., 2020; Grilli et al., 2021). The runup
in the 2018 event exceeded 10 m along the coasts of the Sunda Strait, but the impact of the tsunami
was local. No atmospheric pressure wave was recorded. On the other hand, the 1883 Krakatau
volcano explosion generated significant atmospheric pressure waves, which were recorded in
Europe and the United States, lasting for nine days (Choi et al., 2002). The tsunami waves were
complex 1n the near field, since there were at least three possible generation mechanisms: caldera
collapse, submarine explosion, and pyroclastic flow (Maeno and Imamura, 2011). In the far field,
the correlations between the measured atmospheric pressure waves and tsunami waves suggested
that the atmospheric pressure waves were the possible origin of the tsunami waves (Francis, 1985).
Omura et al. (2022) has provided information on additional historical volcanic explosions that are
linked to similar tsunami generation mechanisms.

For the 2022 Tonga event, abundant atmospheric pressure data and tsunami records are
available 1n the Pacific Ocean region. The objectives of this paper are to correlate these two sets
of data and understand the main tsunami wave features generated by the moving atmospheric
pressure. To achieve these goals, we first construct an empirical model to describe the
characteristics of the atmospheric pressure in time and space using the measured atmospheric
pressure data in the Pacific Ocean after Tongaâ€™s volcanic explosion. This empirical atmospheric
model 1s then used as the forcing function 1n a linear shallow water equation model to generate
tsunami waves. The numerical results are compared with measurements, including the DART buoy
data, which require a correction because the appearance of atmospheric pressure (Liu and Higuera,
2022). The wavelet analysis 1s applied to the corrected DART data and the numerical results to
reveal the time evolution of the dominant wave components of the free surface elevation at selected
DART stations. The dispersion effect on the tsunami propagation induced by the moving
atmospheric pressure shock wave 1s discussed. The results of Lynett et al. (2022), which used a
similar method, also are compared with our results.

This paper 1s structured as follows. Section 2.1 describes the procedure of constructing the
empirical atmospheric pressure model. Section 2.2 explains briefly the reason why the DART buoy
data needs to be corrected when the atmospheric pressure wave appears. Section 2.3 outlines the
LSWE model setup. Section 3 1s devoted to the analysis of the numerical modelling results,
compared against the field observations. In addition, the role that dispersion plays in the pressure-
driven tsunami propagation and the main differences with respect to the atmospheric model
