56 minutes at DART 46407 and 40-69 minutes at DART 32401), leading or trailing. This
conclusion 1s consistent with the observations already made for Figure 8. Generally, the agreement
1s higher 1n terms of the starting times (relative location within the figure) than in the magnitude
(color scale). However, in some instances, such as close to Tonga (DART G, 51425) and 1n the
Northwest Pacific Ocean (DART 21420), the differences are significant, especially when
comparing the components with a higher energy content. In fact, the field observations of DART
51425 highlight the extreme complexity of this event in the near field, since model fails to capture
most of the higher energy components at this location, especially after the trailing waves arrive.
This 1s not a surprise, since as already mentioned, higher frequency waves are not included in the
source model. As we move farther away from the source, the leading and trailing waves are further
separated in time, and it 1s easier to observe the differences between them. The amplitude of the
leading wave decreases with distance, which 1s reflected in the CWT results. Moreover, the leading
wave tends to produce long waves only, and little or no shorter wave components. In some
instances (e.g., DART 21420) lower period components arrive before the trailing wave arrival time,
which means that these must have been produced locally or closer to the DART buoy location
rather than at the volcano, due to their slower celerity. These are likely to have have been produced
by wave scattering (1.e., free wave creation) as the locked wave propagates over the changing
bathymetry, by the mechanisms explained in Vennell (2007). Given that the model solution does
not capture these short-wave components (â‚¬.g., compare both panels in row d), the main hypothesis
is that they may require a finer mesh to be reproduced. However, the finer mesh tested led to
numerical instabilities, so this point could not be verified. On top of this, components with shorter
wavelengths are more susceptible to dispersive effects. Therefore, LSWE may not suffice to
represent them accurately, in which case more sophisticated types of equations, as for example
Boussinesq equations, would be required. An analysis on the dispersion effects for the present
model will be presented in appendix A. Finally, after the trailing wave arrival time, long and short
waves seem to be equally important. This 1s because the free wave produced by the atmospheric
pressure travels at the same celerity as long waves produced by additional mechanisms. Generally,
the longer period components arrive slightly earlier. However, this perception may be slightly
exacerbated by the characteristics inherent to the CWT, which spreads energy over a longer time
for longer periods, due to the longer length of the wavelet used in the analysis of longer periods.
