Figure 11 Distribution of the maximum tsunami amplitudes on the simulation. (a) Overall maximum
amplitudes; (b) maximum amplitudes of the leading wave; (¢) maximum amplitudes of the trailing wave.
Tonga’s volcano denoted by a black star. The dashed line marks the location after which the leading and

trailing waves are fully separated.

The spatial distribution of the maximum (positive) tsunami amplitude in the Pacific Ocean
numerical simulation 1s presented in Figure 11. Panel (a) shows the global maximum throughout
the numerical simulation, while panels (b) and (¢) present the maximum values associated with
the leading and trailing waves, respectively. Therefore, panel (a) can be viewed as the maximum
among panels (b) and (c). To separate the influence of the leading and trailing waves, panel (b)
records the maxima at locations, which are within the influence of the pressure disturbance (r >
