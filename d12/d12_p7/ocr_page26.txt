Moreover, because they have been generated some time after the explosion and some distance
away from Tonga, their expected arrival time 1s still prior to the expected (original) trailing wave
arrival. Therefore, wave scattering 1s most likely the reason why 1n Figure 8 some of the stations
present significant waves arriving after the leading wave, but before the expected arrival time of
the trailing wave. Moreover, 1t can also be observed that in the Northwest Pacific, which 1s free
from the effects of Tonga Trench, the highest amplitude overall 1s produced by the leading wave.
In addition to the larger wave heights in the Southeast Pacific, panel (a) presents interesting
finger-like features in which the maximum wave amplitude 1s larger. Upon closer inspection, these
may have been produced by wave concentration due to the bathymetry features. For example, the
south-most feature appears to correlate with the location of the Louiseville Ridge, east of New
Zealand. The fingers channeling wave energy east are likely enhanced by the Manihiki Plateau
(2,500 m water depth 1n an area that 1s almost 5,000 m deep), the Tuamotu Archipelago, before
following the Sala y Gomez and Nazca ridges towards the coasts of Peru, where two people
drowned and an o1l-spill occurred due to the 2 m high tsunami waves.

formulation in Liu and Higuera (2022). See Figure 11 caption for further context.
It 1s well known that under simple conditions (1.e., constant water depth, shallow water wave
regime) the ocean locked wave has the same shape as the pressure wave, and 1ts amplitude 1s
