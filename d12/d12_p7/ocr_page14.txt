Figure 6 Reported and corrected DART buoy data. The upper panel (a) shows the locations of the DART
buoys in the Pacific Ocean. The lower panels show the time series of the surface elevation of four buoys,
arranged In terms of increasing water depths, before (blue line) and after (black line) the correction has
been applied within the grey window.
2.3 Numerical Model
The numerical model FUNWAVE (Shi et al., 2012; Kirby et al., 2013) has been adopted for
simulating tsunami generation and propagation using the linear shallow water equations (LSWE).
In the spherical coordinates, the LSWE are written as,
on 1 (OM 0 (10)
— + ———9=— + — (cospN {=o
dt  Rcosg 5 dp (cospN)
dM gd 0m d Jp
—+————fN=————4 (11)
dt  Rcosp dy pRcosp oy
dN do d 0
dt R do PR 0g (12)
where M and N are the volume fluxes in the longitude (y) and latitude (¢) directions, respectively,
and 11s the Coriolis force.

In the numerical model, the bathymetry data has been obtained from the ETOPO1 global relief
model at 1 arcmin resolution. The computational domain spans from 100° E to 120° W, and from
70° S to 70° N (Figure 1), which covers the entire Pacific Ocean region. The grid size 1s 4 arcmin
(~3,600 m), and the total grid cell count 1s 6.3 million. The time step 1s 6 s, which 1s small enough
to satisfy the CFL condition. The propagation of the atmospheric pressure and the resulting tsunami
waves are simulated for 20 hours from the volcanic explosion using 48 cores, and the simulations
take 4.6 hours on a 2.4 GHz Xeon workstation. Additional grid refinement sensitivity tests have
been carried out based on grid resolutions of 2 arcmin, 4 arcmin and 8 arcmin, respectively. For
the 2 arcmin grid resolution, the sensitivity analysis could not be completed because significant
numerical instabilities are observed. Nevertheless, the comparisons between the 4 and 8 arcmin
grids indicated that they produced the same results in the near field and only slight differences
were observed 1n the far-field. In the end, the 4 arcmin grid 1s adopted 1n this study.
