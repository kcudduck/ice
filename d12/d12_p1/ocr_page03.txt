(a) Moore’s model:. Moore et al. |2007| assumes that some grains in the sed-
iment source do not move because the tsunami flow is not strong enough.
Furthermore, it is assumed that most grains are transported in suspension.
Based on these assumptions, the shear velocity is determined for the largest
orain in the tsunami deposits. The law of the wall can be employed to find
the shear stress, which is necessary to move the largest grain to get a flow
velocity U. The following equation is used to determine deposition.
h [
wo. b=% (1)

in which wy 1s the settling velocity of the sediment grain. A is the water depth,
[ represents the horizontal distance a grain travels to be deposited. Because
of the horizontal transport, this model is also referred as an advection model.

This model was applied to deposits formed by the 1929 Grand Banks
tsunami, Newfoundland, Canada [Moore et al. 2007]. In this application, it
was estimated that the average flow depth was 2.5 to 2.8 m, and the flow
speed was 1.9 to 2.2 ms™', which are the minima|Moore et al. 2007].
(b) Soulsby’s model:. Soulsby’s model assumes that the water depth increases
linearly between 0 and v1" and decreases from «1 to 1" for any given locations.
1" is the inundation time and 7 is a constant related to run-up time, which
is between 0 and 1. H = Hy + Ah is the maximum flow depth at a given
location during tsunami inundation and decreases toward the inundation
limit, Hy denotes the maximum water depth at the shoreline, Ah denotes
the depth increment due to tsunami:
