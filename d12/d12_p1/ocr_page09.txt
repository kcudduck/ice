where th,, and th; are the modeled and observed thicknesses for each sample
location, () is the number of sample locations. As there is only a limited
number of tsunami deposit samples for the test case applied here, we use
10% as the threshold value.
2.4. Offshore Wave Characteristics and Flooding
In order to estimate a representative offshore tsunami amplitude, we re-
late the water volume calculated from Sousby’s model at maximum inun-
dation with the volume calculated by numerically solving the shallow water
equation. We carry out a parameter study by varying the slope (m) and the
offshore wave amplitude (£). For more details about the parameter study
and employed numerical model, we refer to Appendix II. The water depth
computed from Soulsby’s model is used to calculate the volume of the in-
undation water. With the help of numerical simulations (Appendix II), we
derived the following formulation:
E=M+ XN VAs m+d-VZFrs-m-V 4 Xg-m? y

Where £ is offshore wave height, V' is the water volume that covers the land
at maximum inundation, m is the slope of beach profile. These constants

Ag = 0.0014, A; = 0.027, Ag = —0.011, Ag = 0.051, Ap = 0.053.
