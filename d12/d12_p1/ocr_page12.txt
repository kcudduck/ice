the grain sizes in the sediment source is based on all field samples collected
during the field survey. Flow depth in this model will take full use of both
the field observations and the model results from Soulsby’s model.

3.2. Sedimentary Simulation Results

TSUFLIND first simulates tsunami deposit thickness (Figure 3c). In the
test case, the largest observed thickness is about 0.22 meters at 120 meters
inland. For the first 100 meters in this cross section, the simulated thickness
from TSUFLIND is obviously larger than the field measurement. After 200
meters inland, the simulated thicknesses decrease quickly and generally fit
with the field measurement.

TSUFLIND reconstructs sediment grain-size distributions for both the
entire tsunami deposit and several vertical intervals at any given sample
locations. The error of the entire tsunami sediment grain-size distribution
in this test case is from 0.38% to 1.54%, which can be considered good
simulation results. The error is less than 1.0% from 120 meters to 160 meters
inland and then increases to 1.5% after 160 meters inland. We use four
sediment samples to calculate grain-size distributions (Figure 3d I — IV,
response to 120m, 160m, 177m and 207m from shoreline). Beyond 160 meters
inland, there are fewer coarse grains and more fine grains in the simulated
grain-size distribution than the field measurement (Figure 3d, I, II] and
IV).

In order to study how the grain-size distribution changes in the vertical
direction, we employ the new sediment formation module to simulate tsunami
deposit grading. Figure 3a shows grain-size distribution for several vertical
intervals at four different study locations. The grain size for these recon-
