For distances from the coastline larger than 120 meters, the deposit thickness
simulation results matched well with the observations. However, the obser-
vations are slightly larger due to the presence of topography change that may
slow down the flow (Fig 3c and d). The finer grain-sizes contain the largest
error between observation and model results is likely that the topography
change is the main source of the error. However, the difference could also be
a part of the model uncertainty.

The calculated mean speed decreases from 4.7 ms™' to 3.3 ms! along
the studied section. The speed decreases continuously shown as Fig 4a, the
Froude number increases and then decreases (Figure 4b). The mean Froude
number is around 0.9 for this test case. As the change rate of water depth is
a constant based on Sousby’s model, the mean Froude number changes only
depends on the velocity changes. At first, the flow speed decreases slower
than the water depth, so the mean Froude number increases in this area (150
m to 300m). After some point around 300 meters, the flow decelerates quickly
and causes the Froude number to decrease. The flow speed and Froude num-
ber results from TSUFLIND are shown as ranges of possible values with
uncertainties (Figure 4a and 4b). In Figure 4, the gray area with solid line
boundaries is the estimated flow speed or Froude number with maximum
and minimum possible values. The dashed line is the mean value of the esti-
mated flow speed or Froude number. The ranges of the speed and the Froude
number decrease from 150m to 350m, which indicates the uncertainties de-
crease towards the sample location close to the landward sediment pinch-out.
It 1s possible that the tsunami deposits near the maximum run-up position
become thin, well-sorted and fine-grained containing less information about
