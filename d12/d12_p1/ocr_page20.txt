TSUFLIND implements a simplified method to estimate the representa-
tive offshore tsunami wave amplitude. First of all, the water volume on the
land due to tsunami wave is calculated by:
Ro
V = / h(x)dx (17)
0
where V is the water volume, R,, is the distance of run-up to shoreline, h(x)
is water depth distribution function on land. To simplify this problem, we
assume tsunami wave is a solitary wave. The solitary wave form is given as
a function of distance x and time t by
n(x, t) = Esech” (k(x — Ct)) (18)
where

is assumed as 500 meters. C' is the wave celerity which is expressed as:
