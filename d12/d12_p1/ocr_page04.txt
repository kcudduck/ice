(c) TsuSedMod:. |Jaffe and Gelfenbuam| [2007] developed an inversion model
based on sediment deposited from suspension. There are several basic as-
sumptions in TsuSedMod: (1) sediment is transported in suspension and
deposited when steady and uniform tsunami flow slows down; (2) suspended
sediment concentration is distributed in an equilibrium profile; (3) there is
no erosion caused by return flow. The model iteratively adjusts the sediment
source and the shear velocity to match the sediment grain-size distributions
and thickness of suspension-grading sediment layers |Jaffe et al.[2011), 12012].
For the grain size i, the sediment thickness An is given by:
