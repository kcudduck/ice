to 3.3 ms~! at 350 meters inland. The Froude number, which is around 0.9,
does not change significantly in space. Also the range of possible velocities
and Froude numbers decreases from 150 meters to 350 meters inland.

The flow speed profile shape is influenced by the eddy viscosity profile
and shear velocity. The eddy viscosity profile parameterizes the vertical
distribution of turbulent stress. TSUFLIND follows the flow eddy viscosity
profile based on laboratory data from Gelfenbaum and Smith [1986]. The
How speed gets the largest value on the water surface and decreases toward
the sediment bed. TSUFLIND only gives the depth-averaged values as final
results.

TSUFLIND computes the water surface profile to estimate the water
volume when the tsunami wave reaches the maximum inundation. With the
help of Eq (16), the wave amplitude can be estimated based on the slope (m)
and the water volume (1). For the Eastern India case, the wave amplitudes
range from 5 to 7 meters and the wavelength is close to 50 km.

4. Discussion
4.1. Interpretation of test case results

With the help of the presented model, we can reproduce tsunami sedi-
ments as well as infer the flow condition that generated them based on ob-
servations and analytical results of existing tsunami deposits. Figure 3 sum-
marizes the results of our simulation for the tsunami deposits. The apparent
difference of the deposit thickness between model results and observations for
distances smaller than 120 m from the shoreline can be explained by strong
return flow or large velocities from subsequent waves with small inundation.
