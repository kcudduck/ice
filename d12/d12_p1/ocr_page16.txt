the flow condition. Tsunami wave amplitudes calculated by TSUFLIND are
usually larger than real amplitudes, because the mathematical relationship
(Eq 16) is from frictionless shallow water equations that ignore the effect of
friction.
4.2. Model limitation and improvement

In this study, we combine three tsunami inversion models to simulate
tsunami deposit and estimate tsunami flow parameters. All three of these
models are based on some model-specified basic assumptions. A significant
assumption of TSUFLIND is that the sediment transport and the deposition
process during a tsunami are considered uniform in space and time. Conse-
quently, the deposit comes from both horizontal convergence and suspension
settling. TSUFLIND combines Sousbyâ€™s model and TsuSedMod to simulate
these two processes. This combination greatly improves the grain-size dis-
tribution simulation results. However, when the tsunami flow decelerates
rapidly because of bathymetry changes or any other reasons, some part of
the sediment deposited before will be eroded again. If the flow is strong
enough, a significant part of tsunami deposit may be eroded, just like the
result shown in Figure 3c from shoreline to 100 meters in land. As a result,
the tsunami speed calculated by TSUFLIND will be underestimated.

Another significant assumption of TSUFLIND is that most of tsunami
deposits 1s transported by the suspension load and ignores the contribu-
tion of the bed load. This assumption will overestimate the tsunami How
speed and increase the percentage of coarse grains in the grain-size distribu-
tion. TSUFLIND is not applicable where bed load is the dominant sediment
transport type. In most tsunami cases, tsunami deposits include both bed
