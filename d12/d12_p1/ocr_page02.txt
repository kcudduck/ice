Tsunami inversion models attempt to link the basic information of the
tsunami deposits with the overland flow characteristics. There are three
prominent inversion models: Moore’s advection model [Moore et al. 2007],
Soulsby’s model |Soulsby et al. 2007| and TsuSedMod model |Jaffe and Gelfenbuam
2007]. It should be noted that all these models are based on different basic as-
sumptions and employ different information from the deposits. For example,
Moore’s advection model estimates tsunami flow magnitude by determining
the combination of flow velocity and depth to move the largest grain from
the sediment source to the deposition area [Moore et al. 2007|. In this paper,
we present a joint inversion framework (TSUFLIND), which combines these
three models. TSUFLIND does not only couple all these three inversion
models, but also contains a new method to calculate deposit characteristics
Tang and Weiss 2014. It also uses the calculated flow depth from Soulsby’s
model to estimate a representative offshore tsunami wave amplitude.

2.1. Inversion Models Employed

As mentioned above, there are three prominent tsunami deposition in-
version models that will be used: Moore's advection model, Soulsby’s model
and TsuSedMod model.
