thickness, grain size distribution to flow speed and wave amplitude. However,
these results are restricted by the low condition. For instance the flow speed
of non-uniform or unsteady flow cannot be inversed yet. Also if there were
strong return flows or subsequent waves, the results from TSUFLIND will
contain some uncertainties. From a general point of view, with a simple
bathymetry, the tsunami and paleotsunami as well as other extreme events
can be understood with the help of this joint inversion framework. More
research needs to be done to improve this joint inversion framework presented
to quantify and reduce the uncertainties in the inversion results and expand
applicable conditions.
