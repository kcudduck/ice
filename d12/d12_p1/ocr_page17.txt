load and suspended load. In order to reduce the effect of bed load, only
the suspension-grading part can be considered to estimate the flow speed.
Suspension-grading in sediment is difficult to identify only based on the grain-
size distribution. The simulated suspended-grading part has some difference
with field observations, which also introduces uncertainties to the flow speed
calculation.

TSUFLIND has two aspects that require improvement: the applicable
flow condition and the accuracy of final outputs including sediment simu-
lation and flow speed calculation. The improvement of the applicable area
can be made by employing other tsunami propagation models instead of
Sousbyâ€™s model, which can deal with non-uniform and unsteady flows. At
the same time, the new model needs to consider both the suspension load
and bed load. Also a new method for combining forward and inverse mod-
eling will hold great promise for deciphering quantitative information from
tsunami deposits and decreasing the uncertainties in tsunami sediment trans-
port simulation and inversion results [Sugawara et al. 2014].

5. Conclusion

Modeling the tsunami sediment deposition processes and estimating tsunami
How parameters will greatly improve not only the understanding of deposition
from tsunami but also the risk assessment for extreme high-energy events.
We presented a joint inversion model for tsunami deposit simulation and flow
condition estimations in this paper.

The combination of different inversion models allows the computation of a
wide range of tsunami wave impacts or characteristics, ranging from sediment
