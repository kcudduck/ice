Initial velocity in shallow water equation code is set as:
vo(z,t) = V 9/ hon (z.=0) (21)

We calculate the water volume when tsunami wave got the maximum run-
up based on water distribution function h(x). Water depth function h(x)
comes from a shallow water equations code. The shallow water equations
code used here originally is designed for studying the propagation and runup
of solitary wave by using a high-resolution finite volume method to solve

oun) + 2 (he + ah?) = gh” (23)
where h(x,t) is the flow depth, u(x,t) is the horizontal velocity, ¢ is the
gravitational constant, B(x) is the bed topography function.

In this code, a conservative form of the nonlinear shallow water equations
with source term is solved by using a high-resolution Godunov-type explicit
scheme with Roe’s approximate Riemamn solver In order
to get the mathematical relationship between the maximum water volume
(V'), slope (m) and initial wave amplitude (£), we design a parameter study
by varying slope and wave amplitude to calculate the water volume. Finally,
we use curve fitting methods to get the mathematical relationship based on
parameter study data set.
