2.5. Inversion Framework and Coupling

We use the information from all three models as different components in
this joint inversion framework. The steady flow condition that is presented in
all models, is also presented in TSUFLIND and represents the most simplity-
ing assumption. The inputs to TOUFLIND are the sediment characteristics
for different sampling locations along a slope. However, it should be noted
that the inversion of the flow conditions is carried out for each sample loca-
tion individually. TSUFLIND uses components from Moore model, Soulsby’s
model and TsuSedMod model to adjust the sediment source grain-size dis-
tribution, the sediment source concentration and the average flow velocity
to simulate tsunami sediment thickness and grain-size distribution along the
slope in the deposition zone. If needed, the representative offshore wave am-
plitude can be computed. Figure 2 depicts the flowchart outlining how the
joint inversion model works.

The information needed for a successful inversion includes the grain-size
distribution, sediment thickness as well as the information of the slope along
which the tsunami sediments were sampled. In the inversion framework,
Moore’s advection model is employed to calculate the initial low speed. Be-
cause the Moore's model uses the actual data from the measured sediment
distribution, it reduces the number of iterations significantly. The reservoir
of sediments in the water column is calculated by following Madsen et al.
11993], and it is assumed that all grain-size distributions can be described
with log-normal distributions. The iteration begins with computing the in-
undation with the help of Soulsby’s model, and the initial estimates of the
flow conditions are from the Moore's advection model. The results of this
