The tsunami deposit characteristics are reconstructed by matching sedi-
ment thickness and grain-size distribution with field data. In order to recon-
struct deposit details, the sediment concentration cannot be depth averaged
and is described as a Rouse-type suspended sediment concentration profile.
In this framework, we use the method from Jaffe and Gelfenbuam/ [2007] to
calculate the suspended sediment concentration profile. It is efficient to re-
construct the deposit by calculating times of deposition. The deposition time
of suspended sediment is calculated by:

1) â€” 5 (10)
in which t\" 1s the deposition time for grain size i sediment at elevation z,.
The amount of sediment settling in each grain size class for a given elevation
is tracked as sediment thickness increment:

oY is from the suspended sediment profile |Jaffe and Gelfenbuam [2007], cf?
is the thickness of the sediment increment of the same grain size 7 at elevation
z; and deposited at time t" The deposition time and corresponding sedi-
ment thickness increment are ordered from shortest to longest. If there are
multiple layers in the tsunami sediment, we can compute the grain-size dis-
tribution for each layer separately based on the depositional temporal order
of the sediment thickness increments by:
