struction results ranges from 0 to 6 in ¢ scale, so the portions of simulation
results that are outside of this window are not plotted in Figure 3a. The
number of vertical intervals separated decrease away from the shoreline as
the sediment thickness decreases to zero. These simulation results show some
features similar to the field observation, such as fining inland and upward.

Based on the grain-size distribution for each vertical interval shown in
Figure 3a, the sediment parameters used to describe the deposits can be
calculated. Taking the sample from 120 meters inland as an example, we
calculate the mean grain size, kurtosis, skewness and sorting factor for each
interval. In the bottom several centimeters, the mean grain size does not
change significantly and is about 1.2 in ¢ scale. Then the mean grain size
decreases upward to 2.2 in ¢ scale. The change in kurtosis is about 0.8 to 1.1
in this sample, which indicates the grain-size distribution has a wider grain
size range than a normal distribution. Sediment simulation results in this
example also show that tsunami sediment changes from moderate sorting at
the bottom to well sorting at the top where fine grains become dominant.
Also the grain-size distribution is positively skewed which indicates that the
distribution is skewed to fine grains.

After reconstructing grain-size distributions, TSUFLIND calculates the
How speed and Froude number at the sample locations. In the test case, Fig-
ure 4a and 4b show the flow speed and Froude number distribution along the
slope. The average flow speed decreases from 4.7 ms™! at 150 meters inland
