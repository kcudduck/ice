turbulent mixing cannot be ignored. Therefore resuspension has to be taken
into account. The generation of each individual portion of the tsunami sedi-
ment based on flow condition is the fundamental part to reconstruct tsunami
deposits. For the entire deposit, the basic process is to calculate sediment
thickness (9 (z) for each grain size at each point along the slope by using
Eq and (4) from Soulsby’s model. We assume that the depth averaged
sediment concentration Cy in Eq is the reference sediment concentration
C. here. The reference concentration is calculated for a given flow condition
with [Madsen et al. [1993]:
O(4) — bo(1 =p) FSH (7)
" 1 + [pS
where (3, is the resuspension coefficient, f%) is a fraction of the sediment of
grain size i. S is the normalized excess shear stress given by
56) _ EE n> (8)
0 7 <7
where 73 1s the bed shear stress and iY is the critical shear stress of the
initial sediment movement for grain size 7 [Madsen et al|[1993|.
For a given location x, the grain-size distribution for the entire tsunami
deposit is given by:
Fi = _ Mm) i=1,2,3,...,N (9)
> _i—o CW (2)
where f() is the percentage of grain size i in the entire sediment, (V(x) is
sediment thickness of grain size ¢ and SN (% (x) is total deposit thickness
for all grain sizes. NN is the number of grain size classes.
