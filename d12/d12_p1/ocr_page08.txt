where Fu is the sediment fraction of grain size 7 in layer k. > C Ig is total
sediment thickness with the same grain size 7 in sediment layer £. Index
7 1s used to mark the original location of sediment in the water column.
SN (ZH C “9 is the total thickness of this sediment layer which contains
all grain size classes. In TSUFLIND, the calculation of tsunami flow condition
will use the same method as TsuSedMod model Jaffe and Gelfenbuam2003
2.3. Result Evaluation
We employ the second norm to quantify the error between model and
observed results as a control of the iterative procedure. The second norm of
error for layer k is given by:
Ly) Zim (n= 1) 13)
N
#0 and #40 are the modeled and observed percentages for each grain size
class 7. With the help of L;, we compute the average second norm value for
a location with:
_ 1 &
L=— 2 Ly (14)
We define L < 5% as a good simulation. For the tsunami sediment thickness
simulation, we employ the same process. The second norm value of error for
thickness between the model result and the field observation is given by:
Ly, = i (“ae 100%) (15)
