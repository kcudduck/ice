step are the local low depth and the entire sediment thickness at each sam-
ple location. Our sediment formation module calculates the characteristics of
the deposited sediments. The iterations are controlled by the norm of error
between the simulated and observed deposits and stop after the predefined
threshold is met. As the model outputs, we can estimate the flow speed,
depth and Froude number along the slope. If needed, a range of offshore
reference wave amplitudes can also be computed.

3.1. Field Observation and Data

We employ the field data |Bahlburg and Weiss 2007| from the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami to demonstrate the capabilities of our framework (Figure 3).
These samples come from the coastal area in the vicinity of Ranganatha-
puram, India. Bahlburg and Weiss |2007| identify sediment layers formed
by the tsunami in this cross section and described grain-size distributions for
each layer. There are some grass runners on the top of the tsunami sediment,
which indicate the return flow direction and the erosion caused by the return
How. Most grain-size distributions of the sediment layers in the test case
are unimodal (Figure 3b). Tsunami deposits in this cross section are usually
well sorted, and the mean grain size is between 0.5 and 1.5 in Â¢ scale, which
corresponds to medium and coarse sand. Furthermore, Bahlburg and Weiss
12007] observe that the mean grain size is upward and landward fining in this
cross section. Several sedimentary data, such as the deposit thickness and
the grain-size distribution, will be used as input to TSUFLIND. The range of
