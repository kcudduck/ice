~ The tsunami events that occurred over the last decades have caused an
2 increase In public awareness and resulted in more research on the tsunami
© wave. Tsunami deposits play an important role not only in tsunami hazard
= assessments, but also in interpreting tsunami hydraulics [Hutchinson et al.
= 1997; Moore et al. 2007; Jaffe and Gelfenbuam 2007|. To draw any useful
nl quantitative conclusions from tsunami deposits, the information from de-
> posits about the causative tsunami needs to be extracted either by com-
>< paring parameters from the deposits with results from forward models [see
aw
Bourgeois et al.|1988; Martin et al.|2008| or by inversion models directly [see
Nott 1997; Noormets et al. 2004; Jafle and Geltenbuam 2007; Moore et al.
