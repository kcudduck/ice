determining the shear velocity, the flow speed profile is calculated by :

The TsuSedMod model has been applied to four modern tsunami cases
[Jaffe and Gelfenbuam 2007; Spiske et al. 2010; Jaffe et al. 2011, 2012] and
two paleotsunami cases |Witter et al. 2012; Spiske et al. 2013|. For the 2009
tsunami near Satitoa, Samoa, the flow speed estimated from TsuSedMod at
three locations (100, 170 and 240 meters inland) were 3.6 to 3.8 ms™! (bottom
layer /earlier wave) and 4.1 to 4.4 ms™* (top layer/later wave). These results
are consistent with the 3 to 8 ms™! flow speed from the boulder transport
inverse model |Jaffe et al. 2011].

2.2. Sedimentation model

The method used to calculate the sediment concentration of the sediment
source in TSUFLIND is similar to the one presented in Madsen et al. [1993].
The grain-size distribution of the sediment source is characterized by Ds,
the largest grain and the smallest grain.

When the entire tsunami deposit at a given location is considered, re-
suspension sediment flux can be neglected and Soulsby’s model is applied.
However, if the individual layer in the tsunami deposit is considered, intense
