Received 2017 June 19; in original form 2017 January 12  S U M M A R Y  Most tools and theories for analysing tsunami records were originally developed for coastal sites located far from the tsunami source. As a result, we must take care in using these for records observed inside the focal area where seismic waves can exist together with tsunami. This study investigates the validity and limitations of theories used in past studies. We use 2-D elastic equation of motion as a reference, while most tsunami studies employed incompressible- fluid theory. We first examine a two-step method commonly used for setting the initial con- ditions in tsunami simulations. The method employs the two analytical solutions for the sea-bottom and sea-surface deformations. We found excellent agreement between the initial heights calculated by the two-step method and by the simulation including elastic crust and compressible sea water. We further investigated the change in the ocean-bottom pressure dur- ing tsunami generation. For high-frequency pressure records, although the pressure change was sometimes assumed to be proportional to sea-bottom velocity, this did not hold in general, but worked for the first motion. For low-frequency records, ocean-bottom pressure change was usually assumed to be proportional to sea-bottom acceleration. This works nicely when the deformation is smooth, but fails when the sea bottom deforms steeply. We found that a new analytical solution could reproduce the relation more precisely. The validity and limitations of the conventional theories need to be taken into account when analysing tsunami records inside the focal area.  Key words:   Tsunamis; Theoretical seismology; Wave propagation.  1   I N T R O D U C T I O N  Investigations of tsunami propagation have usually been based on fluid dynamics where sea water is assumed to be an incompressible fluid. For example, tsunami propagation has been simulated with lin- ear long-wave equations, non-linear long-wave equations and linear dispersive equations (Boussinesq equations). These tsunami equa- tions are derived from the equation of motion under the assumptions for an incompressible fluid. Using numerical simulations based on one of these tsunami equations, many studies have analysed and in- terpreted tsunami records observed by tide gauges or ocean-bottom pressure gauges (e.g. Satake 2007; Saito   et al.   2014; Tsushima & Ohta 2014). On the other hand, elastic and gravity theory and recent development of observation showed that the elasticity of the solid earth medium is a partial contributor to tsunami propagation when a long-wavelength tsunami propagates over long distances across the ocean (e.g. Ward 1980; Okal 1982; Inazu & Saito 2013; Tsai  et al.   2013; Allgeyer & Cummins 2014; Watada   et al.   2014). In fact, elastic crustal deformation due to tsunami loading was clearly observed by a high-sensitivity seismograph network over a broad inland area facing the Pacific Ocean coast in Japan (Kimura   et al . 2013). In addition to propagation, the generation of tsunami has been investigated based on fluid dynamics theory using compressible or incompressible assumptions (e.g. Takahashi 1942; Yamamoto 1982; Levin & Nosov 2009; Stiassnie 2010). In evaluating initial tsunami-height distribution as a generation process, most tsunami studies have employed a two-step method for tsunami propagation simulation. First, sea-bottom displacement distribution caused by an earthquake fault dislocation is calculated. The code of Okada (1985) is often used for this calculation. Then, the sea-surface dis- placement caused by sea-bottom displacement is calculated. We have frequently employed the equation, often referred to as Ka- jiura’s equation (Kajiura 1963). In this procedure, we assumed that sea water medium is incompressible. Comer (1984) showed the validity of this two-step method by comparing the waveforms synthesized with it to those cre- ated by the normal-mode technique. The two-step method does not consider the coupling between the sea and elastic solid, whereas the normal-mode technique can account for this cou- pling. However, note that he assumed incompressible fluid for the sea layer in the use of the normal-mode technique. Recently, Lotto & Dunham (2015) compared sea-surface height distribu- tions calculated using compressible sea and incompressible sea 1888   C ©   The Author 2017.

The validity of the conventional two-step method (us- ing Okada’s code and Kajiura’s equation) seems not to have been shown yet. Hence, it is important to examine whether the two-step method works appropriately even for a compressible sea and elastic crust. In order to detect and observe tsunami inside the focal area of an offshore region, an ocean-bottom pressure gauge is one of the most reliable sensors (e.g. Bernard & Meinig 2011; Mungov   et al.   2013; Rabinovich & Ebl´ e 2015). We expect that the tsunami generation process will be observed as an ocean-bottom pressure change inside the focal area using dense and wide tsunami observation networks (e.g. Tsushima   et al.   2012; Maeda   et al.   2015). Hence, it will be important to understand the mechanisms of ocean bottom pressure change caused by sea-bottom motion. Two theoretical relations have been employed in previous studies. When the sea-bottom motion is high frequency (   f   >   c 0 / (4 h 0   )), the relation between sea-bottom pressure   p e   and sea-bottom motion is thought to be given by   p e   =  ρ 0 c 0 v , where   ρ 0   is sea water density,   c 0   is the phase velocity of the ocean acoustic wave and   v   is the velocity at the sea-bottom motion (Bolshakova   et al.   2011; Matsumoto   et al.   2012; Saito & Tsushima 2016). This relation can be theoretically derived in an infinite water medium without the sea bottom. On the other hand, when the sea- bottom motion was sufficiently low in frequency (   f      c 0 / (4 h 0   )), the relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a   was often used, where   h 0   is the sea depth and   a   is the acceleration of the sea-bottom motion (e.g. Filloux 1982; Yamamoto 1982; Bolshakova   et al.   2011; Matsumoto   et al.  2012). Although these two relations have often been used to analyse observed records, their validity inside focal area has not yet been confirmed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the validity and lim- itations of the conventional theories used in tsunami studies. Us- ing the equation of motion in a compressible sea with an elastic crust, we investigate the following method and theoretical relations: (i) the two-step method for setting initial tsunami-height distribu- tion assuming incompressible sea water (the method using Okada’s code and Kajiura’s equation), (ii) the relation   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0 v   for high- frequency sea-bottom motion and (iii) the relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a   for low-frequency sea-bottom motion. We confirm that the method (i) works nicely for setting initial tsunami-height distribution. The rela- tion (ii) does not hold, in general because of the sea-bottom bound- ary condition. The relation (iii) works nicely when the sea-bottom deformation is smooth, but fails when it deforms steeply. We also show that the analytical solution of Saito (2013) could reproduce the relation between the pressure and the motion at sea bottom more precisely than the simple relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a   for steep sea-bottom deformation.  2   T S U N A M I   G E N E R AT I O N R E P R O D U C E D   B Y   E L A S T I C   D Y N A M I C S 2.1 Tsunami generation and propagation  When an earthquake occurs under the sea, the sea-bottom defor- mation caused by the earthquake uplifts the sea surface (Fig. 1a). The raised sea surface then collapses due to gravity; the collapsed sea water volume displaces a massive amount of sea water, and the displacement propagates as a tsunami (Fig. 1b). This process can be theoretically investigated based on the water wave theory (e.g. Takahashi 1942; Kajiura 1963; Kervella   et al . 2007). In Cartesian coordinates, where the ( x ,   y ) axes are in the horizontal plane, and the   z -axis is vertical upward from the sea surface at   z   =   0 and down toward the sea depth at   z   =   − h 0   , the velocity potential  φ ( x ,   y ,   z ,   t ) caused by a vertical displacement on the sea bottom  d ( x ,   y ) occurring at the time   t   =   0 is given by,  φ   ( x ,   y ,   z ,   t )   = −   1 (2 π )   2  ∫   ∞ −∞  ∫   ∞ −∞  dk   x   dk   y   exp   [ i   ( k   x   x   +   k   y   y )]  ×   ˆ d   ( k   x   ,   k   y  )  k  {   − g 0  ω 0 [cosh ( kz )   +   tanh ( kh 0   ) sinh ( kz )] sin ( ω 0 t )   H   ( t )  +   1  k   sinh ( kh 0   )   δ   ( t )  }  (1) where   ˆ d ( k   x   ,   k   y   ) is the 2-D Fourier transform of   d ( x ,   y ),   g 0   is the gravitational acceleration,   k   =  √  k 2  x   +   k 2  y   is the horizontal wavenumber and   ω 0   =   √ g 0 k   tanh( kh 0   ) is the angular frequency. The function   H   ( t ) is   H   ( t )   =   0 when   t   ≤   0 and   H   ( t )   =   1 when  t   >   0 (Saito 2013). The first term on the right-hand side represents the tsunami prop- agation. This describes the wave propagation in ( x ,   y ) space with the dispersion relation   ω 0   =   √ g 0 k   tanh( kh 0   ). Note that this propa- gation is caused by gravity. Hence, the first term includes the gravity acceleration   g 0   . The second term, given by the delta function, rep- resents the source term. Unlike the first term, the source term does not include the gravity acceleration   g 0   . These show that tsunami propagation is governed by gravity as a restoring force, whereas the generation process is independent of gravity. This idea has been widely and implicitly assumed in most stud- ies, in which the initial height distribution is calculated without considering gravity, and then tsunami propagation is calculated as  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/3/1888/3892341 by guest on 27 September 2025

This study also investigates tsunami by treating the generation and propaga- tion processes separately. However, unlike most past tsunami studies that assumed incompressible sea water, we describe the generation process based on elastic equation of motion, including the com- pressibility of the sea and the elasticity of the crust. The equation of motion in an elastic medium is given by,  ρ  ∂ 2 u   i   ( x ,   t )  ∂ t 2   =   σ i j ,   j   +   f   i   ,   (2) where   ρ   is the density of the medium,   u   i   is the particle displacement in the medium,   σ i j   is the stress tensor and   f   i   is the body force equivalent to fault motion. We represent a finite earthquake fault as a set of point dislocation sources represented by an equivalent body force. The constitutive relation of the elastic medium:  σ i j   =   λδ i j   u   k , k   +   2 μ   ( u   i ,   j   +   u   j , i  )   ,   (3) is used where   λ   and   μ   are the Lam´ e’s coefficient. We consider a 2-D elastic medium consisting of the sea layer ( V P   =   1.5 km s − 1   ,   V S   =   0 km s − 1   and   ρ   =   1.0   × 10 3   kg m − 3   ) and the uniform crust ( V P   =   6.92 km s − 1   ,   V S   =   4.0 km s − 1   and  ρ   =   2.8   × 10 3   kg m − 3   ) containing the earthquake fault (Fig. 2). The traction is free ( σ   iz   =   0) at the sea surface. We numerically solved eqs (2) and (3) to satisfy the boundary conditions by the finite- difference method with the second order in space and time (e.g. Saito & Tsushima 2016). It is difficult to represent rigorously the fluid- solid boundary by the fourth-order or higher order approximations in space (e.g. Nakamura   et al.   2012).  3   R E S U LT S 3.1 Slow and rapid dislocation  An earthquake fault was set with a width of 100 km and a dip of 15 ◦ . The top of the fault was located 5 km deep from the sea bottom. Although the actual earthquake rupture was characterized by a wide range of frequencies from the DC to high-frequency components (at least   ∼ 10 Hz, e.g. Aki & Richards 2002), this study employed an earthquake rupture characterized by a simple source-time function in order to clarify the mechanisms of wave excitation depending on the time-scale. The rupture starts simultaneously on the earthquake fault. We use a Gaussian function   f   ( t ) :  f   ( t )   =   1  √ π  4  t   c  exp  [  −   ( t   −   t 0   )   2 ( t   c   / 4)   2  ]  (4) to give the slip rate of the dislocation. The parameter   t c   controls the duration of the earthquake. The functions with   t c   =   4 and 40 s in eq. (4) are plotted in Fig. 3(a). The spectral amplitude is given by,  |   ˆ f   ( ω ) | =   exp  [  −   1 4  (   t   c  4  ) 2  ω 2  ]  .   (5) Fig. 3(b) compares the spectral amplitudes of   t c   =   4 s (dashed line) and 40 s (solid line). The short duration of   t c   =   4 s has a broader spectral content than that of   t c   =   40 s. Fig. 4 shows the temporal and spatial distributions of the sea- surface height, sea-bottom vertical displacement and vertical ve- locity in the sea when a long-duration earthquake ( t c   =   40 s) is assumed. At the elapsed times of 60 s (Fig. 4a), the vertical velocity (or vertical flow) exists above the earthquake fault, which uplifts the sea bottom and surface. Sea-bottom and sea-surface displacement gradually increase with time. At the elapsed time of 80 and 100 s (Figs 4b and c, respectively), the slip on the fault ends and the ver- tical flow excited by the fault slip disappears. If we look carefully at the temporal change of the velocity distribution, we recognize that a long-wavelength wave propagates horizontally. The wave front is located at 80 and 150 km at the elapsed times of 80 and 100 s, respectively (Figs 4b and c). The propagation velocity is   ∼ 3.5 km s − 1   , corresponding to a Rayleigh wave. At the elapsed time of 200 s (Fig. 4d), the seismic wave leaves the simulation region. The sea- bottom displacement remains above the earthquake fault, which is considered to be the permanent sea-bottom deformation. Since this simulation neglected gravity, sea-surface displacement does not collapse, but remains as a permanent deformation.  0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 20   40   60   80   100 Time [s] (a   b) 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 0.001   0.01   0.1   1   10 Frequency [Hz]  t c   = 4 s t c   = 40 s t c   = 4 s t c   = 40 s  Figure 3.

Vertical- displacement distributions at the sea surface (blue) and at the sea bottom (black) are plotted in the upper bin. Vertical-velocity distribution in the vertical cross section is displayed with a colour map in the lower bin. The sea depth is 4 km (0   <   z   <   4 km). The black line in the crust indicates the earthquake fault. Fig. 5 shows the simulation results when a short-duration earth- quake ( t c   =   4 s) is assumed. The wave front of the seismic waves is clearly recognized on the sea bottom (black line in the upper panel) at   x   =   130 km at an elapsed time of 100 s (Fig. 5b) and at   x   =   200 km at an elapsed time of 120 s (Fig. 5c). The Rayleigh wave propagates with a speed of   ∼ 3.5 km s − 1   . The velocity distribution in Fig. 5(c) indicates that the Rayleigh wave energy extends from the sea layer to the deep crust at   x   = ∼ 100 to   ∼ 200 km. On the other hand, at  x   = ∼− 200 to   ∼ 100 km, the energy is concentrated in the sea layer. This indicates that these later waves are trapped within the sea layer. These waves are ocean acoustic waves, which are also recognized in Fig. 5(d). Figs 4 and 5 show that the excitation of the ocean acoustic waves strongly depends on the earthquake duration or source spec- tra (Fig. 3). When the source spectrum contains high-frequency components, the ocean acoustic waves (the   P   waves trapped within the sea layer) are efficiently excited. On the other hand, the perma- nent sea-bottom deformation (or sea-surface deformation) caused by the long- and short-duration earthquakes are identical.

Fig. 6(b) verifies this agreement of the sea-surface deformation for long and short durations.  3.2 Validating a two-step method for sea-surface height distribution  A two-step method using Okada’s code and Kajiura’s equation is often used for setting the initial conditions in numerous tsunami studies (e.g. Inazu   et al.   2016a). In order to confirm whether the two- step method can rigorously reproduce the surface height distribution as the elastic equations of motions (eqs 2 and 3), we compare our simulation results of the elastic equation with the initial tsunami- height distribution calculated by the two-step method. In the two-step method, the initial tsunami-height distribution is obtained by applying a spatial low-pass filter, often referred to as the Kajiura filter (e.g. Takahashi 1942; Kajiura 1963), to the vertical- displacement distribution at the sea bottom (e.g. Tanioka & Seno  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/3/1888/3892341 by guest on 27 September 2025

This low-pass filter for the 2-D case is theoretically derived by the incompressible-fluid theory as,  η 0   ( x ,   y )   =   1 2 π  ∫   ∞ −∞  dk exp [ ikx ]   ˜ d   ( k ) cosh ( kh 0   )   (6) where ˜ d ( k ) is the 2-D wavenumber spectral contents of the vertical displacement   d ( x ) at the sea bottom. In eq. (6), the displacement at the sea bottom   d ( x ) is given by the solutions of the equilibrium equations, 0   =   σ i j ,   j   +   f   i   ,   (7) where a free-surface boundary condition is assumed at the sea bot- tom. This means that the effect of sea layer is neglected. Note that the conventional method using eqs (6) and (7) neglects the compressibility of the sea water in the calculation of the initial tsunami-height distribution from the sea-bottom deformation. We numerically calculated the permanent sea-bottom deformation in 2-D space by setting the fault length much longer than the fault width in the 3-D analytical solution (e.g. Okada 1985). Fig. 7(a) compares the sea-bottom deformation calculated by the equations of motion (eq. 2) (grey line) and the equilibrium equations (7, red line). The two lines show very good agreement. This agreement indicates that the sea water does not meaningfully affect the permanent sea-bottom deformation. The agreement cal- culated by the analytic solution of the equilibrium equations and the equations of motions was also reported by previous studies, for example by Wald & Graves (2001) considering only solid earth and by Maeda & Furumura (2013) considering both sea water and  −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Height [m] −300   −200   −100   0   100   200   300 Distance [km] (a) Sea Bottom tc = 40 s Static Solu. −0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Height [m] −300   −200   −100   0   100   200   300 Distance [km] (b) Sea surface  Figure 7.

These two lines also show very good agreement. The agreement in Figs 7(a) and (b) confirms the validity of the incompressible-fluid theory in the calculation of the initial tsunami-height distribution for tsunami propagation simulations. Note that Comer (1984) and Saito & Furumura (2009) supported the validity of the Kajiura equation in the case of an incompressible sea, whereas this study confirms validity in the case of compressible sea and elastic crust.  3.3 Ocean-bottom pressure change  It would not be possible in practice to directly observe the initial height   distribution   with   current   observation   technologies.   A promising way to detect the generation of tsunami would be to use ocean-bottom pressure gauges deployed inside the earthquake focal area (e.g. Tsushima   et al . 2009, 2012; Maeda   et al.   2015; Gusman  et al.   2016). However, tsunami signals recorded by ocean-bottom pressure gauges inside and near the source are contaminated by dynamic pressure change due to seismic waves (Saito & Tsushima 2016). Therefore, it is important to investigate how the ocean-bottom pressure fluctuates according to seismic waves. The mechanism of dynamic pressure change depends on time-scale  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/3/1888/3892341 by guest on 27 September 2025

The value of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   is plotted as well (red), where   v bot  z   is the vertical velocity at the bottom.

Filloux (1982) reported that the ocean-bottom pressure change  p e   is proportional to the sea-bottom acceleration as   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   , where   ρ 0   is the water density,   h 0   is the sea depth and   a bot  z   is the vertical acceleration at the sea bottom. This relation should hold when the wave frequency is much lower than the characteristic frequency of the ocean acoustic waves,   f      c 0 / (4 h 0   ), where   c 0 is the phase velocity of the ocean acoustic wave. If we do not consider sea layer, or consider sea depth to be infinite   h 0   =   ∞ , the compressible fluid theory predicts that   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0   v , where   c 0 is the phase velocity of the acoustic wave in the sea (e.g. Saito & Tsushima 2016). Bolshakova   et al.   (2011) insisted that the ocean- bottom pressure change   p e   is proportional to velocity as   p e   =  ρ 0 c 0   v   for high-frequency waves   f   >   c 0 / (4 h 0   ) and is proportional to acceleration as   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   for low-frequency waves (   f     c 0 / (4 h 0   )). We here examine whether the relations   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0   v   and  p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   are valid.  3.4 High-frequency ocean-bottom pressure records  Fig. 8(a) shows the ocean-bottom pressure record (grey line) in the case of   t c   =   4 s. The first wave of the sea-bottom pressure has a positive value of approximately 0.2 MPa, indicating compressional stress. Because the sea bottom uplifts the sea water, the first wave accompanies compressional stress. The subsequent pressure waves take alternating negative and positive values (grey line in Fig. 8a). These waves are generated by the reflections at the sea surface and bottom. The sign of the pressure changes at the reflection at the sea surface, because the sea surface acts as a stress-free condition. On the other hand, the sign remains the same at the reflection at the sea bottom. These sea-surface and sea-bottom boundary conditions explain why the later waves take alternating negative and positive values. The temporal change of the value of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   (red) is also plotted. The first wave of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   shows good agreement with the sea-bottom pressure change   p e   . However, the later wave of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z  is significantly different from the pressure change   p e   . The value of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   becomes very small, because the sea bottom acts as an almost zero-velocity boundary condition (rigid boundary). Because this boundary condition is not taken into account when deriving a simple relation   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0 v z   (see Saito & Tsushima 2016), the relation becomes invalid for later waves. We found that the relation  p e   =   ρ 0 c 0 v z   holds only at the first motion. A similar result is also recognized in the waveforms of   ρ 0 c 0 v z   at   x   =   100 km in Fig. 8(b).  3.5 Sediment  Because   the   heterogeneous   subsurface   structure   affects   high- frequency wavefield, we simulated a case when a sediment (soft) layer exists beneath the sea layer. We now suppose a three-layer structure: the sea layer ranges the depth of 0–4 km, the sediment 4–8 km and the crust   > 8 km. The sediment layer is characterized by  V   P   =   2.4 km s − 1   ,   V   S   =   1 . 0 km s − 1   and   ρ   =   2.15 g cm − 3   (Guo   et al . 2016). In the sediment, the   S -wave velocity is slower than   P -wave velocity in the sea layer. We conducted a simulation using the same fault model as in the previous case; the top of the fault was located at the depth of 5 km from the sea bottom (Fig. 9). High-frequency seismic waves trapped within both the sea and the sediment lay- ers. As a result, the effective thickness of the low-velocity layer becomes larger. This effect of sediment was also pointed out by Bolshakova   et al.   (2011). Fig. 10 shows the sea-bottom pressure change and the vertical velocity when the soft sediment exists. The waveforms changed due to the soft sediment. Even if there is the soft sediment, the first wave of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   shows good agreement with the sea-bottom pressure change   p e   . The later wave of   ρ 0 c 0 v bot  z   is significantly different from the pressure change   p e   .  3.6 Low-frequency ocean-bottom pressure records  We   then   examined   the   low-frequency   ocean-bottom   pressure change. A tsunami-generation theory based on the incompressible- fluid theory gives the analytical solution of the ocean-bottom pres- sure in 3-D space (eq. 25 in Saito 2013). By using this solution, the analytical solution at the sea bottom   z   = − h 0   is given by,  p e   ( x ,   z   = − h 0 ,   t )  =   ρ 0   g 0 2 π  ∫   ∞ −∞  dk   exp ( ikx )   1 cosh   kh 0 ˆ η   ( k ,   t )  +   ρ 0 h 0 2 π  ∫   ∞ −∞  dk   exp ( ikx )  tanh kh 0  kh 0 ˆ a bot  z   ( k ,   t )   .   (8) When the tsunami wavelength is much longer than the sea depth  kh 0      1, this is approximated to  p e   ( x ,   z   = − h 0 ,   t )   ≈   ρ 0   g 0 η   ( x ,   t )   +   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   ( x ,   t ) for   kh 0      1 .  (9) The tsunami height is represented by   η ( x ,   t ) and ˆ η ( k ,   t ) in the spatial and wavenumber domains, respectively. The vertical acceleration at the sea bottom is represented by   a bot  z   ( x ,   t ) and ˆ a bot  z   ( k ,   t ) in the spatial and wavenumber domains, respectively. Saito & Tsushima (2016) synthesized the pressure change during the tsunami gen- eration caused by seismic wave and tsunami. They numerically calculated the pressure change from low to high frequencies. On the other hand, eq. (8) is expected to be valid in low-frequency range. However, note that whether eq. (8) works or not in elastic simulations has not been shown yet.  Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/3/1888/3892341 by guest on 27 September 2025

The first term on the right-hand side of eqs (8) and (9) repre- sents the ocean-bottom pressure loaded by the tsunami height   η . Since this term is represented using the gravitational constant   g 0   , this originates from gravity. The second term represents the ocean- bottom pressure change generated by the sea-bottom acceleration as a dynamic effect. This can be considered as the reaction force from the water column to the sea bottom responding to the action of the sea bottom accelerating the water column with an acceleration of  a bot  z   ( x ,   t ), since   ρ 0 h 0   is the mass (per unit area) of the water layer. We can approximately represent the contribution from the sea-bottom acceleration as   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   when the wavelength of the sea-surface height and the sea-bottom acceleration are much longer than the sea depth ( h 0      1 / k 0   ). The relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   was used as a funda- mental equation in past studies (e.g. Filloux 1982; Bolshakova   et al . 2011; Matsumoto   et al.   2012). However, the relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z  cannot be derived without the approximation based on the assump- tion of   kh 0      1. The incompressible-fluid theory (eq. 8) illustrates that a long-wavelength pass filter of tanh kh 0 / kh 0   is necessary to correctly provide the relation between the ocean-bottom pressure and the acceleration. The filter removes the contribution of the short-wavelength components of the acceleration to the pressure. We investigated whether the sea-bottom pressure numerically simulated   in   the   previous   section   can   be   reproduced   by   the incompressible-fluid theory given by eqs (8) and (9). We set   g 0   =   0 in eqs (8) and (9) when comparing the solution with our simulation results. Fig. 11 shows the simulation result of the spatial and tempo- ral distributions of the vertical acceleration   a bot  z   at the sea bottom for a slip duration of   t c   =   40 s. Fig. 11(a) indicates that the sea bottom from   x   = ∼− 90 to   = 0 km accelerates upward during an elapsed time between 45 and 60 s.

See Fig. 8 for the details. filter tanh kh 0 / kh 0   to Fig. 11(a), we obtained Fig. 11(b). Although filter should have excluded the short-wavelength component, there are no significant differences between Figs 11(a) and (b). This is because the short-wavelength component was originally poor in the sea-bottom deformation in Fig. 11(a). Fig. 11(c) shows the spatial and temporal distributions of the sea-bottom pressure. Figs 11(a)– (c) show almost the same distributions in spatial and temporal space. We also compare the waveforms of the ocean-bottom pressure and the vertical acceleration at   x   = − 50 km in Fig. 11(d). The grey line shows the ocean-bottom pressure change. The blue line corresponds to the waveform of the acceleration at the sea bottom, but we con- verted the acceleration to a pressure by using the simple relation  p   e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   . The red line corresponds to the waveform of the acceleration at the sea bottom in Fig. 11(b), where we converted the acceleration to pressure using the long-wavelength pass filter that is represented in the wavenumber domain as   ρ 0   h 0   tanh kh 0 / kh 0   as in the second equation in eq. (8). The three curves show very good agreement with each other. This means the analytical solution of the incompressible-fluid theory is able to predict the dynamic pressure change due to sea-bottom acceleration. Also, the simple solution of  p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   works well. We then examined the case when the sea-bottom and height distributions are steep, which is characterized by dominant short- wavelength components. We set a small earthquake with a width of 5 km where the top of the fault was located 1 km from the sea bottom, to generate much short-wavelength component in the sea-bottom deformation. Fig. 12(a) shows the numerical simula- tion results of the spatial and temporal distributions of the low- frequency vertical acceleration   a bot  z   at the sea bottom. The sea- bottom acceleration occurs within a narrow range in the   x -axis ( x   = −   10 to 0 km). Applying a spatial long-wavelength pass fil- ter tanh kh 0 / kh 0   to Fig. 12(a), we obtained Fig. 12(b). Because the filter of tanh kh 0 / kh 0   substantially reduced the short-wavelength components, there is a significant difference between Figs 12(a) and (b). Fig. 12(c) shows the spatial and temporal distributions of the ocean-bottom pressure. The ocean-bottom pressure change (Fig. 12c) is more similar to that of the acceleration after the spatial filtering is applied (Fig. 12b). Fig. 12(d) compares the waveform at  x   =   0 km. There is a large difference between the ocean-bottom pres- sure (grey) and the value of   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   (blue). However, the accelera- tion filtered by   ρ 0 h 0   tanh kh 0 / kh 0   (red) shows very good agreement with the ocean-bottom pressure (grey). This evidently indicates that the incompressible-fluid theory of eq. (8) accurately predicts the relation between the sea-bottom pressure change and sea-bottom motion, although the simple relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   could not.  4   D I S C U S S I O N 4.1 Seismic waves and tsunami forecasting  Some studies have already reported that the ocean-bottom pres- sure gauges detect the sea-depth change caused by both sea-surface height change and sea-bottom deformation, but not detect the sea- surface height change only (e.g. Tsushim a et al.   2012). On the other hand, GNSS Buoys can detect only sea-surface height change (e.g. Inazu   et al . 2016b). Hence, we might expect that high-precision measurement of the displacement at the sea surface by using GNSS Buoys would be more suitable for tsunami measurement than ocean- bottom pressure gauges. However, it should be noted that the dis- placement at the sea-surface height does not correspond to tsunami height. Our simulation results (Fig. 5) indicated that the ocean acoustic waves significantly contribute to the displacement at the sea surface, in addition to the tsunami. This was not a serious prob- lem when we observed tsunami at coastal stations located far from the source. In such cases, the tsunami arrives at the coasts much later than the seismic waves due to the large difference in their propagation velocities. However, in the focal area soon after an earthquake occurs, it is necessary to consider the contribution of seismic waves when analysing sea-surface displacement. Since the seismic and tsunami observations in the focal area should be avail- able in the near future, and rapid tsunami prediction is crucial for our society, studying the temporal change in the displacement field near the focal area considering the sea water compressibility and seismic waves is extremely important.  4.2 Ocean-bottom pressure change  Simple   theoretical   relations   between   the   sea-bottom   pressure change and sea-bottom motions (   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0 v z   and   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   ) were often used in past studies. However, the simple relation  p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   fails when a steep sea-bottom deformation occurs. This study introduced a better solution based on the incompressible- fluid theory (eq. 8). We expect that an inelastic wedge near the trench can cause a steep sea-bottom deformation (e.g. Tanioka & Seno 2001; Ma & Hirakawa 2013; Xu   et al.   2015). Such steep defor- mation was actually reported at the 2011 Tohoku earthquake by the offshore sensors (e.g. Ito   et al.   2011; Maeda   et al.   2011). After the Tohoku tsunami, a new dense tsunami observation network inside the source area was planned. To fully develop the potential of this new dense tsunami observation, and to reveal the mechanisms of steep deformations caused by huge earthquakes, it is important to recognize that the relation   p e   =   ρ 0 h 0 a bot  z   is a simplified equation using a smoothing approximation on sea-bottom deformation. In future, it will also be important to theoretically evaluate the contri- bution of the non-linearity (e.g. Nosov   et al.   2008) and the realistic bathymetry (e.g. Tanioka & Satake 1996).  4.3 Validity of the incompressible-fluid theory for permanent displacement  Most tsunami studies have assumed an incompressible sea in- stead of a compressible sea (e.g. Saito   et al.   2014).

Some studies confirmed the va- lidity of the analytical solution by the numerical simulations using an incompressible sea (e.g. Kervella   et al.   2007; Saito & Furumura 2009). However, the validity of this incompressible-fluid theory for compressible fluid and elastic crust has not been fully investi- gated. Lotto & Dunham (2015) compared the spatial and temporal height distributions of the incompressible-fluid theory to those cal- culated with compressible sea and elastic crust. They recognized a slight but clear difference between the simulation results. They interpreted this difference as due to the fault kinematic or compress- ibility of the sea water, but did not determine the specific cause. This study, on the other hand, confirmed that there is good agreement in terms of permanent deformations between the solution using the incompressible-fluid theory and the numerical solution including compressible sea and elastic crust. This suggests that the difference found by Lotto & Dunham (2015) was due to the fault kinematics.  5   C O N C L U S I O N S  Based on a theory, tsunami generation can be considered to be independent of gravity, whereas tsunami in itself propagates using gravity as a restoring force. From this notion, we investigated the validity and limitations of the following three conventional theories used in tsunami studies.

(i) A two-step method (using Okada’s code and Kajiura’s equa- tion) is usually used to set initial tsunami-height distribution. We confirmed the validity of this method by showing excellent agree- ment between initial tsunami heights calculated by the two-step method and by the simulation including elastic crust and compress- ible sea. However, note that the two-step method cannot reproduce the sea-surface displacement correctly during the generation pro- cess, because seismic waves, not considered in the two-step method, significantly contribute to the temporal change of sea-surface dis- placement. (ii) A relation   p e   =   ρ 0 c 0 v   is sometimes used for high-frequency sea-bottom motion (   f   >   c 0 / (4 h 0   )). We found that this relation does not hold, in general, because of the sea-bottom boundary condition. This relation worked only for the first motion. (iii) A relation   p e   =   ρ 0   ha   is often used for low-frequency sea- bottom motion (   f      c 0 / (4 h 0   )). This relation works nicely when the sea-bottom deformation is smooth ( kh 0      1), but fails when the sea bottom deforms steeply. The elastic numerical simulations showed that the analytical solution of Saito (2013) could reproduce more precisely the relation between the pressure change and the sea-bottom motion. Because conventional tsunami theories were originally developed for near-shore observations, we should take care in using these theories for records observed offshore or inside the source region. Recent studies revealed shorter scale heterogeneous slip distribu- tion on earthquake faults, and the steep sea-bottom deformation that occurred when the rupture reached the sea surface.

Tsunami generation   1899 seismic waves can significantly contribute to sea-surface displace- ment near the hypocentre. Although these have long been considered as secondary contributions and neglected in many tsunami studies, they are not negligible in recent observations, in particular, in focal area observations. Our results will contribute to the interpretation of records obtained near or inside the focal area.  A C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S  The author would like to thank E. Fukuyama, M.
