SUMMARY 5
Most tools and theories for analysing tsunami records were originally developed for coastal 2
sites located far from the tsunami source. As a result, we must take care in using these for 5
records observed inside the focal area where seismic waves can exist together with tsunami. a
This study investigates the validity and limitations of theories used in past studies. We use 2-D =
elastic equation of motion as a reference, while most tsunami studies employed incompressible- 3
fluid theory. We first examine a two-step method commonly used for setting the initial con- =
ditions in tsunami simulations. The method employs the two analytical solutions for the a
sea-bottom and sea-surface deformations. We found excellent agreement between the initial 2
heights calculated by the two-step method and by the simulation including elastic crust and S
compressible sea water. We further investigated the change in the ocean-bottom pressure dur- =!
ing tsunami generation. For high-frequency pressure records, although the pressure change e
was sometimes assumed to be proportional to sea-bottom velocity, this did not hold in general, a
but worked for the first motion. For low-frequency records, ocean-bottom pressure change was 3
usually assumed to be proportional to sea-bottom acceleration. This works nicely when the E:
deformation 1s smooth, but fails when the sea bottom deforms steeply. We found that a new =
analytical solution could reproduce the relation more precisely. The validity and limitations of Q
the conventional theories need to be taken into account when analysing tsunami records inside o
the focal area. 2
