£ An earthquake fault was set with a width of 100 km and a dip of
S 15°. The top of the fault was located 5 km deep from the sea bottom.
Although the actual earthquake rupture was characterized by a wide
range of frequencies from the DC to high-frequency components (at
least ~10 Hz, e.g. Aki & Richards 2002), this study employed an
earthquake rupture characterized by a simple source-time function
