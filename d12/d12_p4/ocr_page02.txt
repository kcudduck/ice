effects, which prevents us from extracting the details of the generation =

process. Besides, because the tide gauges are located in very shallow sea 2

and the sampling rate is too low to resolve short-period tsunamis, they E

hardly capture tsunami dispersion (e.g., Kubota, Saito, & Suzuki, 2020). Therefore, most past studies used >

2-D nondispersive tsunami equations for the analyses of the observed data. ;

Tsunami observations have exhibited impressive growth in past decades due to the development of g

ocean-bottom pressure gauges, which enabled us to observe tsunamis outside bays and harbors (e.g., Aoi :

et al., 2020; Bernard & Meinig, 2011; Kanazawa et al., 2016; Kaneda et al., 2015; Kawaguchi et al., 2015; 5

Mungov et al., 2013; Rabinovich & Eblé, 2015; Tsushima & Ohta 2014). Unlike coastal tide gauges, deep- FE

ocean observations can capture clear tsunami signals (e.g., Grilli et al., 2013; Inazu & Saito, 2014; Kubota, :

Saito, Chikasada, & Suzuki, 2020; Sandanbata et al., 2018). The high-quality records in open oceans have 5

driven studies about dispersion and high-resolution tsunami source estimations (e.g., Baba et al. 2015; Kirby 3

et al., 2013; Saito & Kubota, 2020). Moreover, ocean-bottom pressure gauges can catch tsunamis inside the g

generation field (e.g., Mikada et al., 2006; Mizutani et al., 2020; Nosov et al., 2007). This drastically changed :

tsunami research because the generation cannot be described by 2-D equations that were often used in past A

tsunami studies. Three-dimensional (3-D) fluid theories play a fundamental role in the generation process =

(Lotto & Dunham, 2015; Lotto et al., 2017; Maeda et al., 2013; Takahashi 1942). Saito (2013) investigated Z

the 3-D tsunami generation due to sea-bottom deformation, providing a theoretical basis for the initial tsu- [

nami height distribution for the 2-D tsunami simulations. The study also works as the basis for a unified =

simulation method for seismic and tsunami waves (Saito, 2019; Saito & Tsushima, 2016; Saito et al., 2019). H

However, at present, it seems that 3-D studies have not been done for meteorological tsunamis yet. E

This study theoretically describes the tsunamis generated by sea-surface pressure changes in an incom- :

pressible sea. Particularly, we investigate the ocean-bottom pressure changes during tsunami generation ‘

considering 3-D fluid motions. Besides, the formulation can include short-wavelength tsunamis exhibiting ¢

the dispersion. Section 2 describes a 3-D theory of tsunami generation. Section 3 visualizes and investigates :

tsunami generation due to sea-surface pressure changes based on the solutions. Considering a growing <

surface pressure change that is not moving, we simulate the tsunamis to clarify the excitation mechanism. E

We then simulate the tsunamis generated by a moving surface-pressure change source. We also study the S

dispersion in meteorological tsunamis. Finally, Section 4 concludes this study. :

2.1. Fundamental Equations 2

The Cartesian coordinate system (Figure 1) is used for the formulation, where the x and y axes are in the 3

horizontal plane and the z-axis is taken positive downward. The sea surface at rest is located at z = 0. We ;

assume a constant sea depth located at z = Ay, :

We consider that a particle, located at x = xe, + ye, + ze at time 7 = 0 (e; is the basis vector for Hy

the i axis), is displaced to r(x, Y, Zs () =X + u(x, Y, Zs () at time t, where the displacement vector 5

u(x, Y, Zs () =u.e + ue, + ue, describes the motion in the medium (e.g., Dahlen & Tromp, 1998). This |
