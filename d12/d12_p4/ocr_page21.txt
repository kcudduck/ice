Figure Al shows the complex w plane for Equation A3, where the poles are located at :

For t < 0, we take the closed integration path (i) in the region Im @ > 0. There are no poles inside the path :

(i). The integration along the semicircular path in the upper omega plane, Im ® > 0, becomes zero in Equa- -

tion A3. We then obtain f (7) = 0 for t < 0. For t > 0, we take the path (ii) for the integration and have =

where Res (a) means the residue at = @,. Calculating the residue values and considering that integration 5

along the semicircular path in the lower omega plane, Im ow < 0, yields zero, we obtain E
