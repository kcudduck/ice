description is different from those like v(r,t) where the attention is not focused on each particle motion 5

labeled by x but on each point fixed in space r (e.g., Gill, 1982; Pedlosky 2003). When neglecting the change Z

(e.g., Equation 3.57 in Dahlen & Tromp, 1998; Equation 9.26 in Segall, 2010), where 7 is the stress change =

caused by the motion, py is the density, and g, is the gravitational acceleration. There is no shear stress in the $

fluid and the stress tensor is described as =

T(x, y, 21) = ~p(x. y, 211 (2) z

where p is the pressure change caused by the motion and I is the identity matrix. We assume no dilatation =

of the water medium: :

At the sea bottom, we set no vertical displacement: 5

At the sea surface, we give the pressure change as 4

Q

The Equations 1-5 describe the fluid motion. In particular, this study considers the sea-surface pressure =

change Equation 5 as the source. We will find the solutions u(x, y, z, t) and p(x, y, z, t). Using u(x, y, z, t), we 2

derive the tsunami height n(x. y, () = —u, (x. y, 0, f) Z

2.2. Wavenumber Integration Method E

To find the solutions u(x, y, z, t) and p(x, y, z, t) that satisfy Equations 1-5, we use the wavenumber integra- :

tion method. The displacements and the pressure change are represented as integrals with respect to the £

wavenumber and the angular frequency: S
