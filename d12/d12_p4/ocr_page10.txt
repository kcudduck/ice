pressure source, the surface height is subsided outside the pressure source (x < ~-30 km and x > ~30 km in 5
the second panels in Figures 2d and 2e) so as to satisfy the water volume conservation. The water volume is Z
displaced horizontally. The displacement propagates as tsunamis. <
We consider the characteristic length of the sea-surface pressure change as L.. For example, we may roughly :
consider 2a in Equation 41 as L.. The characteristic wavenumber is then k, = 27 / L.. We perform a dimen- g
sional analysis using Equation 44 for the early elapsed time ¢ < T considering @, = ck, where c is the phase E

Equation 49 indicates that the tsunami height n(x, y, t) develops with time t irrespective of the source du- z
ration T when T is much shorter than the characteristic time given by 7, = L. / c. This characteristic time =
T. is a time scale for a tsunami propagating the distance of the source size or roughly corresponding to the aq
time when the sea-surface height inside the source reaches equilibrium (Figure 2e). In Figure 2, we set ]
the source duration as T = 30 s, smaller than the characteristic time 7, ~ 200 s. If we set the duration T 3
longer than the characteristic time T,, the amplitude of the leading tsunamis becomes smaller (e.g., Saito & :
Furumura, 2009). E
The bottom pressure change (the bottom panels in Figure 2) increases with time in Figures 2c-2e. The :
increasing sea-surface height makes the pressure change at the sea bottom less. As more time elapses (Fig- H
ure 2f), the sea surface remains uplifted (top second panel in Figure 2f) to compensate the surface-pressure E
source, and the horizontally displaced water volume propagates as a tsunami (x < ~-30 km and x > ~30 km ]
in the top second panel in Figure 2f). The propagating tsunamis are detectable as ocean-bottom pressure =
changes. 2
3.2. A Comparison with the Tsunamis Generated by an Earthquake :
The surface pressure change p(x y,0, () = Do (x y)H (7) generates tsunamis that are identical to the tsuna- E
mis generated by the initial height distribution n(x. y, t= 0) given by

In other words, here, n(x y, 0) is the equivalent initial tsunami height for the pressure change source g
Po (x. y)H (2): The 3-D formulation in this study derives this equivalence between the sea-surface pressure :
change source and the initial height distribution source only for the tsunamis outside the source region. :
From Equation 30, we represent the tsunamis caused by the surface pressure change as two terms: g
