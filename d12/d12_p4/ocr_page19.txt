Figure 7. Tsunami height distributions for various elapsed times (+ = 200, 400, 600 s). (a) The source is given by E
Equation 57 where the peak pressure change is P, = —1 mH,0 (~ —-9.8 kPa), the duration is 7" = 30 s, the spatial Ei
scale is given by a = 10 km, and the velocity is given by V;, = 0.20 km/s (= 1.0,/g,h, and hy = 4 km). (b) Instead of z
the dispersion relation @, = ,/gyk tanh (kz ) (Equation 26), we set @, = k4/gyh, in this simulation to remove wave 2
dispersion. Other parameters are the same as those in Figure 7a. 5

we recognized that dispersion appears when the wave propagates over long distances. Figure 7 compares g
the tsunami height distributions at various elapsed times for dispersive and nondispersive simulations. We ]
found that the maximum tsunami height is attenuated more due to dispersion. The attenuation effect due :
to dispersion is recognized also in the case of Vj, = 1.1,/g,h, (Figures C2c and C3c in Appendix C). On the =
other hand, in the case of Vj, = 0.9,/g,h, (Figure 8), the first negative wave becomes smaller, whereas the :
maximum height of the second wave becomes higher due to dispersion. It is interesting that the dispersion :
possibly enlarges the maximum tsunami height for the moving pressure change source, although it reduces g

the maximum sea-surface height of tsunamis arising from thrust fault earthquakes (e.g., Saito et al., 2014). =
A dispersive-tsunami amplification was also reported for normal fault earthquakes (Baba et al. 2020) and &
landslide tsunamis dominated by short-wavelength waves (Baba et al., 2019). 2
Equations 67 and 68 show that pressure change is given by the sum of two contributions: sea-surface height :
change and pressure change loaded at the sea surface. When the wavelength was long, we approximated z

Equation 67 as Equation 68. However, when the wavelength is short, we cannot use Equation 68. The >
factor 1/ cosh (kh ) works as a low-wavelength-pass filter for the ocean-bottom pressure change. Tsunamis 5
for which the wavelength is much shorter than the sea depth (kA, > 1) do not contribute to ocean-bottom
pressure change. :
4. Conclusions T
We formulated 3-D tsunami generation by pressure changes on the sea surface in an incompressible sea. :
We simulated the tsunami generation by a growing pressure change at a fixed location. We found that a :
