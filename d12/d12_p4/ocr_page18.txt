The first and the second terms indicate the waves propagating along the positive x direction. In particu- 5
lar, the first term increases with increasing time or with the travel distance ct. As a result, the first term Z
becomes dominant over the second term for long travel distances. The waveform is given by the spatial <
derivative of the pressure change distribution. This feature is confirmed in Figure 3. The spatial deriva- ]
tive increases the short-wavelength components. An increase in the short-wavelength component is also :
observed in the waves propagating in the same direction as a moving source in kinematic source models 2

The pressure change is given by the sum of two contributions: sea-surface height change p, got (x. y, / and g

the sea-surface pressure change p_ .. . (x. y, / to correctly estimate 7(x, y, t). For example, in the case where :
the time is 60 s (Figure 3c), the ocean-bottom pressure change is negative —0.5 mH,O. However, the actual Z

We then simulate the case of a shorter wavelength (¢ = 10 km in Equation 57) pressure change source, 2
where the wavelength of the pressure change is not much longer than the sea depth. Figure 5 shows the E
temporal changes of the wavefields in the case of V,, = 1.0,/g,%, . In Figure 6, in order to compare dispersive &
and nondispersive tsunamis, we also plot the wavefields without dispersion by setting a, = k./g,h, in Equa- :
tions 59-62 instead of setting the dispersion relation of Equation 26. Comparing Figure 5f with Figure 6f, =
