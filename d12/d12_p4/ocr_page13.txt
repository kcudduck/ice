3.3.1. Long-Wavelength Tsunamis ¢
Using Equations 58-62, we visualize the wavefields caused by a moving negative pressure change in Fig- aq
ure 3. The pressure change source is characterized by F, = -1 mH,0 (= ~ —9.8 kPa) and ¢ = 20 km in 3
Q

Equation 57. The pressure change source appears at + = 0 s and moves in the positive x-direction with the :
velocity V, = 0.2 km/s (= 1.04/goh ). At early times (Figures 3a and 3b), the tsunami height is small, less :
than 0.1 m. As the time increases, the tsunami height increases. At the time 500 s, the maximum height is 3
about 2.5 m, which is considerably larger than the maximum height of 1 m that was observed in the case 2
of a fixed source. This tsunami amplification is due to a moving source, which is often referred to as the 5
Proudman effect (Proudman, 1929). Figure 4 shows the tsunami height distributions for various elapsed BE
times. Appendix C describes the cases for different velocities of Vj; = 0.18 km/s (= 0.9,/gyh, ), and 0.22 km/s :
(= 1.14/gohy ). The overall features of the tsunami heights were common between the cases of V, = 0.9./g,A,, ]
Jgoho» and 1.1 goh :
We further calculate the sea-surface height of Equation 58 using approximations to obtain interpretations :
of Figure 3. Since p, (x) is real, p, (=k. ) =p, (k, where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. We cal- :
culate Equation 58: 2
