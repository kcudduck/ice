Figure 8. Tsunami height distributions for various elapsed times (¢ = 200, 400, 600 s). (a) The source is given by Equation 57 where the peak pressure change E
is Py = —1 mH,0 (~ —9.8 kPa), the duration is T = 30 s, the spatial scale is given by a = 10 km, and the velocity is given by V;, = 0.18 km/s (= 0.9,/g,4, and :
ho = 4 km). (b) Instead of the dispersion relation @, = ,/g,k tanh (kz ) (Equation 27), we set @, = k4/gyh, in this simulation to remove wave dispersion. Other [
parameters are the same as those in Figure 8a. =
negative sea-surface pressure change made the sea-surface height uplifted inside the source region and g

negative leading waves radiated from the source. We also simulated a case when the tsunamis are generated :

by a moving pressure change. When the pressure change migrates near the tsunami-propagation veloci- 7

ty, the tsunami height increases with increasing travel distance. This was originally predicted by Proud- 5

man (1929) in the 2-D long-wave theory. The solutions in this study are in a 3-D space that can include =

the depth-dependent particle velocities and pressure distributions in the sea. The derived solutions of the :

pressure changes suggest that both the tsunami height and the sea-surface pressure changes contribute to =

the ocean-bottom pressure change. This means that we can detect tsunamis by using ocean-bottom pressure 5

gauges but need to know the sea-surface pressure change to correctly measure tsunami height by using the d

pressure gauges. Moreover, when the pressure change source was characterized by short-wavelength com- E

ponents, tsunamis showed dispersion. The dispersion sometimes possibly increases tsunami height more :
extensively than the predictions assuming nondispersive tsunamis. The solutions derived in this study are :

useful for recent offshore tsunami observations where the pressure gauges possibly detect the tsunami gen- e

eration process with meteorological origins. :
