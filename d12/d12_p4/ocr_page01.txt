that cannot directly observe tsunami generation. However, recent tsunami sensors have enabled us to
capture the tsunamis in open oceans and we expect that they can help us directly observe their generation.
In order to fully investigate the generation process including vertical water flow, the theory needs to be
formulated in three-dimensional (3-D) space. This study theoretically formulates meteorological tsunamis
in 3-D space. We derive new solutions that can theoretically visualize tsunami generation and growth
processes. The solutions also predict the pressure changes at the sea bottom during the generation process,
which are observable by recent tsunami observation networks.
1. Introduction
While disastrous tsunamis are mostly generated by large earthquakes, some tsunamis are excited by pres-
sure disturbances at sea surfaces caused by meteorological phenomena such as storms and moving convec-
tive systems (e.g., Churchill et al., 1995; Monserrat et al., 2006). Such tsunamis are known as meteorological
tsunamis or meteotsunamis. The basic generation mechanism of a meteorological tsunami was theoret-
ically investigated in two-dimensional (2-D) space with long-wave approximations (e.g., An et al., 2012;
