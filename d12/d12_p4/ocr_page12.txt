We find that that the two pressure changes do not agree p(x. y, hy, () # pbotom (x, y, hy, ] inside the pressure z
change source. Such disagreement is also found in the tsunami height and velocity fields inside the pressure z
change source. These disagreements were not detectable in the past observations in which tsunami sensors E
were located only outside the source region. However, this difference should appear in recent tsunami ob- =
servations which are intended to detect tsunamis inside the source region. =

3.3. Moving Surface Pressure Change :
We suppose a pressure change of the same spatial distribution as Equation 41 but moving with the propa- =

As discussed using Equation 48, the tsunami is independent of the source duration T when the duration is =
much shorter than the characteristic time T.. The vertical upward displacement, the velocities inside the sea g
layer, and the pressure change at the sea bottom are obtained by the convolution of the pressure change 57 E
with the impulse responses of Equations 32-37. The vertical upward displacement is 2
