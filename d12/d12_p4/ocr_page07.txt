Here, we attach a bar on the left-hand side variables as u, rather than u, because this impulse response or :
the Green's function has a dimension that is different from u,. The corresponding tsunami height is given by 2

3.1. Surface Pressure Change at a Fixed Location 2
As the simplest case, we consider the surface pressure change as not moving. The pressure change starts at :
t = 0 and increases linearly with duration T. The sea-surface pressure source is represented as z
