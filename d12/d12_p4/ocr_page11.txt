Note that the first term contributes to tsunamis only inside the surface pressure change but does not contrib- z
ute to tsunamis outside the surface pressure change (i.e., the area where p, (x, y) = 0) since it does not propa- =
gate. On the other hand, the second term contributes to the tsunamis outside the pressure change since it does =
propagate as waves due to the factor of cos (51). As a result, the tsunami outside the source region is given by $
