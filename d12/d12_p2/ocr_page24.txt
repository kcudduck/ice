¢ is a characteristic length’:
v=0%, n=1L»0, u=/glu, t=+/l/gt, c= (h+n)/l
After dropping the tildes, the dimensionless system of equations (34)-(36)
becomes
uy + uu, +1, = 0,
ny + |lu(—x tan + n)|, = 0.
In terms of the variable c, these equations become
us + uu, + 2cc, + tan = 0,
2c; + cu, + 2uc, = 0.
The equations written in characteristic form are

Next one can rewrite the hyperbolic equations in terms of the new variables

One obtains

3In fact there is no obvious characteristic length in this idealized problem. Some authors
simply say at this point that ¢ is specific to the problem under consideration.
