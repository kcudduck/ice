more important to the west of the rupture. Considering the Stokes number
to be of order one leads to the following system in dimensional form?:
Up + Uy + gny — Lh Uggs = 0, (44)
ny + [u(h +n), — Lh Ug = 0. (45)
The classical Boussinesq equations are in fact slightly different. They are
obtained by replacing u with the depth averaged velocity

They read
Ur + Uy + gy — Lh uy = 0, (46)

A number of variants of the classical Boussinesq system were studied by
Bona et al., who in particular showed that depending on the modeling of
dispersion the linearization about the rest state may or may not be well-
posed Bona et al. [2002].
3.6 Korteweg—de Vries equation
The previous system allows the propagation of waves in both the positive
and negative x—directions. Seeking solutions travelling in only one direction,
for example the positive z—direction, leads to a single equation for n, the
Korteweg-de Vries equation:

The solitary wave solutions of the Korteweg—de Vries equation are of elevation
(a > 0) and travel faster than cy. Their speed increases with amplitude. Note
that a natural length scale appears:

“Equations (44) and (45) could have been obtained from equations (28) and (30).
