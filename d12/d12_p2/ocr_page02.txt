1 Introduction

(Given the broadness of the topic of tsunamis, our purpose here is to
recall some of the basics of tsunami modeling and to emphasize some general
aspects, which are sometimes overlooked. The life of a tsunami is usually
divided into three phases: the generation (tsunami source), the propagation
and the inundation. The third and most difficult phase of the dynamics of
tsunami waves deals with their breaking as they approach the shore. This
phase depends greatly on the bottom bathymetry and on the coastline type.
The breaking can be progressive. Then the inundation process is relatively
slow and can last for several minutes. Structural damages are mainly caused
by inundation. The breaking can also be explosive and lead to the formation
of a plunging jet. The impact on the coast is then very rapid. In very shallow
water, the amplitude of tsunami waves grows to such an extent that typically
an undulation appears on the long wave, which develops into a progressive
bore Chanson [2005]. This turbulent front, similar to the wave that occurs
when a dam breaks, can be quite high and travel onto the beach at great
speed. Then the front and the turbulent current behind it move onto the
shore, past buildings and vegetation until they are finally stopped by rising
eround. The water level can rise rapidly, typically from 0 to 3 meters in 90
seconds.

The trajectory of these currents and their velocity are quite unpredictible,
especially in the final stages because they are sensitive to small changes in the
topography, and to the stochastic patterns of the collapse of buildings, and to
the accumulation of debris such as trees, cars, logs, furniture. The dynamics
of this final stage of tsunami waves is somewhat similar to the dynamics of
flood waves caused by dam breaking, dyke breaking or overtopping of dykes
(cf. the recent tragedy of hurricane Katrina in August 2005). Hence research
on flooding events and measures to deal with them may be able to contribute
to improved warning and damage reduction systems for tsunami waves in the
areas of the world where these waves are likely to occur as shallow surge waves
(cf. the recent tragedy of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004).

Civil engineers who visited the damage area following the Boxing day
tsunami came up with several basic conclusions. Buildings that had been
