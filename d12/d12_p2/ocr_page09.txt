2.4 Finite rectangular source
Now, let us consider a more practical problem. We define the elementary
dislocations Uy, Us, and Us, corresponding to the strike-slip, dip-slip, and
tensile components of an arbitrary dislocation. In Figure 1 each vector rep-
resents the direction of the elementary faults. The vector D is the so-called
Burger's vector, which shows how both sides of the fault are spread out:
D=u"—u".
A general dislocation can be determined by three angles: the dip angle
0 of the fault, the slip angle 6, and the angle ¢ between the fault plane and
Burger's vector D. This situation is schematically described in Figure 2.

For a finite rectangular fault with length L and width W occurring at
depth d (Figure 2), the deformation field can be evaluated analytically by
changing the variables and performing integration over the rectangle. This
was done by several authors Chinnery [1963], Iwasaki and Sato [1979], Okada,
11985, 1992|, Sato and Matsu’ura [1974]. Here we give the results of their
computations. The final results represented in compact form are listed below
