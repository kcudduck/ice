v— Abstract

= The life of a tsunami is usually divided into three phases: the gen-

ay eration (tsunami source), the propagation and the inundation. Each

© phase is complex and often described separately. A brief description

ae! of each phase is given. Model problems are identified. Their formula-

I tion is given. While some of these problems can be solved analytically,

9 most require numerical techniques. The inundation phase is less doc-

2 umented than the other phases. It is shown that methods based on

Ne Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are particularly well-suited

far for the inundation phase. Directions for future research are outlined.
