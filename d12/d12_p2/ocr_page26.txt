6 Direction for future research
A usetul direction for future research in the dynamics of tsunami waves is
the three-dimensional (3D) simulation of tsunami breaking along a coast. For
this purpose, different validation steps are necessary. First more simulations
of a two-dimensional (2D) tsunami interacting with a sloping beach ought
to be performed. Then these simulations should be extended to the case of
a 2D tsunami interacting with a sloping beach in the presence of obstacles.
An important output of these computations will be the hydrodynamic load-
ing on obstacles. The nonlinear inelastic behaviour of the obstacles may be
accounted for using damage or plasticity models. The development of Boussi-
nesq type models coupled with structure interactions is also a promising task.
Finally there is a need for 3D numerical simulations of a tsunami interact-
ing with a beach of complex bathymetry, with or without obstacles. These
simulations will hopefully demonstrate the usefulness of numerical simula-
tions for the definition of protecting devices or security zones. An important
challenge in that respect is to make the numerical methods capable of han-
dling interaction problems involving different scales: the fine scale needed for
representing the damage of a flexible obstacle and a coarse scale needed to
quantify the tsunami propagation.
