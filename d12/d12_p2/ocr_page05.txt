The components of the force per unit area on a surface element are denoted
as follows:
IT; — oy ‘Vj,
where the v;’s are the direction cosines of the normal to the surface element
Sokolnikoff and Specht [1946]. A Volterra dislocation is defined as a surface
>. in the elastic medium across which there is a discontinuity Aw; in the
displacement fields of the type
Au; = uf —u; =U; + Qin, (3)
ij = —y (4)
Equation (3) in which U; and §2;; are constants is the well-known Weingarten
relation which states that the discontinuity Aw; should be of the type of a
rigid body displacement, thereby maintaining continuity of the components
of stress and strain across X..
The displacement field in an infinite elastic medium due to a dislocation
of type (1) is then determined by Volterra’s formula Volterra [1907]

Once the surface XJ is given, the dislocation is essentially determined by
the six constants U; and );;. Therefore we also write
U, €);;
ug (yr) — T // or (P, Q)v,;dS + a [[ taser Q) — x07 (P, Q) tv, dS, (6)

where ();; takes only the values (219, {2o3, {23;. Following Volterra Volterra
1907] and Love Love [1944] we call each of the six integrals in (6) an ele-
mentary dislocation.

It is clear from (5) and (6) that the computation of the displacement field
ur (Q) is performed as follows: A force Fle; is applied at (J, and the stresses
03 (P, Q) that this force generates are computed at the points P(z;) on ¥. In
particular the components of the force on > are computed. After multipli-
cation with prescribed weights of magnitude Au; these forces are integrated
over > to give the displacement component in ¢) due to the dislocation on
