3.3 Shallow-water equations 19
Differentiating (26) first with respect to x and then to respect to y gives a
set of two equations:
wu + aut + 00g) + 1p — 50(Ugs + Viay) = 0, (28)
vp + a(uuy + voy) + ny — 50 (Ute + Vy) = 0. (29)
The kinematic condition (27) can be rewritten as
ne + [u(l + an)l, + [v(1 + an), = §B8[(Viu). + (V7). (30)
Equations (28)—(30) contain in fact various shallow-water models. The so-
called fundamental shallow-water equations are obtained by neglecting the
terms of order (3:
ug + uty + vuy) +10. = 0, (31)
vr + a(uv, + vv) +1, = 0, (32)
ne + [u(l + an). + [v1 + an), = 0. (33)
Recall that we assumed A to be constant for the derivation. Going back to an
arbitrary water depth and to dimensional variables, the system of nonlinear
shallow water equations reads
Up + Uy + VUy + gn, = 0, (34)
vr + uv, + vv, + gn, = 0, (35)
ne + [uh +n)ls + [o(h +n), = 0. (36)
This system of equations has been used for example by Titov and Syno-
lakis for the numerical computation of tidal wave run-up Titov and Synolakis
1998]. Note that this model does not include any bottom friction terms. To
solve the problem of tsunami generation caused by bottom displacement,
the motion of the seafloor obtained from seismological models Okada [1985]
and described in Section 3 can be prescribed during a time ty. Usually tj is
assumed to be small, so that the bottom displacement is considered as an in-
stantaneous vertical displacement. This assumption may not be appropriate
for slow events.

The satellite altimetry observations of the Indian Ocean tsunami clearly
show dispersive effects. The question of dispersive effects in tsunamis is
open. Most propagation codes ignore dispersion. A few propagation codes
that include dispersion have been developed Dalrymple et al. [2006]. A well-
known code is FUNWAVE, developed at the University of Delaware over the
past ten years Kirby et al. [1998]. Dispersive shallow water-wave models are
presented next.
