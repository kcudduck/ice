2.2 Volterra’s theory of dislocations 4

Several studies showed that the effect of earth curvature is negligible
for shallow events at distances of less than 20° Ben-Mehanem et al. [1970],
Ben-Menahem et al. [1969], McGinley [1969], Smylie and Mansinha [1971].
The sensitivity to earth topography, homogeneity, isotropy and half-space
assumptions was studied and discussed recently Masterlark [2003]. The au-
thor used a commercially available code, ABACUS, which is based on a finite
element model (FEM). Six FEMs were constructed to test the sensitivity of
deformation predictions to each assumption. The main conclusion is that the
vertical layering of lateral inhomogeneity can sometimes cause considerable
effects on the deformation fields.

The usual boundary conditions for dealing with earth’s problems require
that the surface S of the elastic medium (the earth) shall be free from
forces. The resulting mixed boundary-value problem was solved a century
ago Volterra [1907|. Later, Steketee proposed an alternative method to solve
this problem using Green’s functions Steketee [1958].

2.2 Volterra’s theory of dislocations

In order to introduce the concept of dislocation and for simplicity’s sake,
this section is devoted to the case of an entire elastic space. The second
reason is that in his original paper Volterra solved the problem in this case
Volterra [1907].

Let O be the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system in an infinite elastic
medium, xz; the Cartesian coordinates (1 = 1,2, 3), and e; a unit vector in
the positive z;-direction. A force F = Fe, at O generates a displacement
field u¥(P, 0) at point P, which is determined by the well-known Somigliana,
tensor

ur (P, 0) = Lar an — QT Gk), With a = Arp (1)

STL A420
In this relation 9,5; is the Kronecker delta, A and py are Lamé’s constants,
and r is the distance from P to O. The coefficient a can be rewritten as
a = 1/2(1 — v), where v is Poisson’s ratio. Later we will also use Young's
modulus £, which 1s defined as
HBA 2)

The notation r ; means Or/0x; and the summation convention applies.

The stresses due to the displacement field (1) are easily computed from
Hooke’s law:

0; = AO; Uk 1 + p(w; + Uj ;). (2)
