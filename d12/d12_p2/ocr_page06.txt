2.3 Dislocations in elastic half-space

When the case of an elastic half-space is considered, equation (5) remains
valid, but we have to replace oy; by another tensor Wi This can be explained
by the fact that the elementary solutions for a half-space are different from
Somigliana solution (1).

The wy; can be obtained from the displacements corresponding to nuclei
of strain in a half-space through relation (2). Steketee showed a method of
obtaining the six Ww fields by using a Green's function and derived w?,, which
is relevant to a vertical strike-slip fault. Maruyama derived the remaining
five functions Maruyama [1964].

It is interesting to mention here that historically these solutions were first
derived in a straightforward manner by Mindlin Mindlin [1936], Mindlin and Cheng
11950], who gave explicit expressions of the displacement and stress fields for
half-space nuclei of strain consisting of single forces with and without mo-
ment. It is only necessary to write the single force results since the other
forms can be obtained by taking appropriate derivatives. Their method con-
sists in finding the displacement field in Westergaard’s form of the Galerkin
vector Westergaard [1935]. This vector is then determined by taking a linear
combination of some biharmonic elementary solutions. The coeflicients are
chosen to satisty boundary and equilibrium conditions. These solutions were
also derived by Press in a slightly different manner Press [1965].
