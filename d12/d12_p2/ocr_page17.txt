3.2 Dimensionless formulation 17
integrated, the fields n(x, y,0) and ¢(x,y, z,0) must be specified at t = 0.
The conservation of momentum equation (9) is not required in the solution
procedure; it is used a posterior: to find the pressure p once n and ¢ have
been found.

In the following subsections, we will consider various approximations of
the full water-wave equations. One is the system of Boussinesq equations,
that retains nonlinearity and dispersion up to a certain order. Another one
is the system of nonlinear shallow-water equations that retains nonlinearity
but no dispersion. The simplest one is the system of linear shallow-water
equations. The concept of shallow water is based on the smallness of the ratio
between water depth and wave length. In the case of tsunamis propagating
on the surface of deep oceans, one can consider that shallow-water theory is
appropriate because the water depth (typically several kilometers) is much
smaller than the wave length (typically several hundred kilometers).

3.2 Dimensionless formulation
The derivation of shallow-water type equations is a classical topic. Two
dimensionless numbers, which are supposed to be small, are introduced:
a d?
a=—- <1, = — 1, 15

‘<1 p=5 (15)

where d 1s a typical water depth, a a typical wave amplitude and ¢ a typical

wavelength. The assumptions on the smallness of these two numbers are

satisfied for the Indian Ocean tsunami. Indeed the satellite altimetry obser-

vations of the tsunami waves obtained by two satellites that passed over the

Indian Ocean a couple of hours after the rupture occurred give an amplitude

a of roughly 60 cm in the open ocean. The typical wavelength estimated

from the width of the segments that experienced slip is between 160 and 240

km Lay et al. [2005]. The water depth ranges from 4 km towards the west of

the rupture to 1 km towards the east. These values give the following ranges
for the two dimensionless numbers:

15x10 <a<6x107* 1.7x107°<f<625x107% (16)

The equations are more transparent when written in dimensionless variables.
The new independent variables are

v=0T, y=1Ly, =z=dz, t=1I0t/cy, (17)

where cy = +/gd, the famous speed of propagation of tsunamis in the open

ocean ranging from 356 km/h for a 1 km water depth to 712 km/h for a 4
