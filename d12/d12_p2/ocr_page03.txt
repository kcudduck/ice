constructed to satisty modern safety standards offered a satisfactory resis-
tance, in particular those with reinforced concrete beams properly integrated
in the frame structure. These were able to withstand pressure associated with
the leading front of the order of 1 atmosphere (recall that an equivalent pres-
sure p is obtained with a windspeed U of about 450 m/s, since p = p,;U?/2).
By contrast brick buildings collapsed and were washed away. Highly porous
or open structures survived. Buildings further away from the beach survived
the front in some cases, but they were then destroyed by the erosion of the
ground around the buildings by the water currents Hunt and Burgers [2005].

Section 2 provides a description of the tsunami source when the source
is an earthquake. In Section 3, we review the equations that are often used
for tsunami propagation. Section 4 provides a short discussion on the energy
of tsunamis. Section 5 is devoted to the run-up and inundation of tsunamis.
Finally directions for future research are outlined.

2 Tsunami induced by near-shore earthquake

The inversion of seismic data allows one to reconstruct the permanent
deformations of the sea bottom following earthquakes. In spite of the com-
plexity of the seismic source and of the internal structure of the Earth, sci-
entists have been relatively successful in using simple models for the source
Okada [1985]. A description of Okada’s model follows.

2.1 Introduction

The fracture zones, along which the foci of earthquakes are to be found,
have been described in various papers. For example, it has been suggested
that Volterra’s theory of dislocations might be the proper tool for a quan-
titative description of these fracture zones Steketee [1958|. This suggestion
was made for the following reason. If the mechanism involved in earthquakes
and the fracture zones is indeed one of fracture, discontinuities in the dis-
placement components across the fractured surface will exist. As dislocation
theory may be described as that part of the theory of elasticity dealing with
surfaces across which the displacement field is discontinuous, the suggestion
seems reasonable.

As commonly done in mathematical physics, it is necessary for simplicity’s
sake to make some assumptions. Here we neglect the curvature of the earth,
its gravity, temperature, magnetism, non-homogeneity, and consider a semi-
infinite medium, which is homogeneous and isotropic. We further assume
that the laws of classical linear elasticity theory hold.
