3.1 Classical formulation

The surface wave problem consists in solving Laplace’s equation (10) in a
domain €2(t) bounded above by a moving free surface (the interface between
air and water) and below by a fixed solid boundary (the bottom). The free
surface is represented by F(x,y, z,t) := n(x, y,t) — 2 = 0. The shape of the
bottom is given by z = —h(z,y). The main driving force is gravity.

The free surface must be found as part of the solution. Two boundary
conditions are required. The first one is the kinematic condition. It can be
stated as DF/Dt = 0 (the material derivative of F' vanishes), which leads to

m+ Veo -Vn—9¢.=0 at z=n(z,y,t). (12)
The second boundary condition is the dynamic condition which states that
the normal stresses must be in balance at the free surface. The normal stress
at the free surface is given by the difference in pressure. Bernoulli's equation

(11) evaluated on the free surface z = n gives
Or + 5|IVOP +502 + gn =0 at z=n(z,y,t). (13)

Finally, the boundary condition at the bottom is

Vo -Vh+¢,=0 at z= —h(x,y). (14)

To summarize, the goal is to solve the set of equations (10), (12), (13)
and (14) for n(x,y,t) and ¢(x,y, z,t). When the initial value problem is

The surface wave problem can be easily extended to the case of a moving bottom.
This extension may be needed to model tsunami generation if the bottom deformation is
relatively slow.
