3 Propagation of tsunamis

The problem of tsunami propagation is a special case of the general water-
wave problem. The study of water waves relies on several common assump-
tions. Some are obvious while some others are questionable under certain
circumstances. The water is assumed to be incompressible. Dissipation is
not often included. However there are three main sources of dissipation for
water waves: bottom friction, surface dissipation and body dissipation. For
tsunamis, bottom friction is the most important one, especially in the later
stages, and 1s sometimes included in the computations in an ad-hoc way. In
most theoretical analyses, it 1s not included.

A brief description of the common mathematical model used to study
water waves follows. The horizontal coordinates are denoted by x and y, and
the vertical coordinate by z. The horizontal gradient is denoted by

The horizontal velocity is denoted by
u(x, y, z,t) = (u,v)
and the vertical velocity by w(x, y, z,t). The three-dimensional flow of an
inviscid and incompressible fluid is governed by the conservation of mass

In (9), pis the density of water (assumed to be constant throughout the fluid
domain), g is the acceleration due to gravity and p(x, y, z,t) the pressure
field.

The assumption that the flow is irrotational is commonly made to analyze
surface waves. Then there exists a scalar function ¢(z,y, z,t) (the velocity
potential) such that
