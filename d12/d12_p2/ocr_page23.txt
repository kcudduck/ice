4 Energy of a tsunami 23
For the Indian Ocean tsunami, it gives roughly ¢ = 377 km. It is of the order
of magnitude of the wavelength estimated from the width of the segments
that experienced slip.
4 Energy of a tsunami

The energy of the earthquake is measured via the strain energy released
by the faulting. The part of the energy transmitted to the tsunami wave is
less than one percent Lay et al. [2005]. They estimate the tsunami energy to
be 4.2 x 10! J. They do not give details on how they obtained this estimate.
However, a simple calculation based on considering the tsunami as a soliton

The value for the integral is 4/3. The numerical estimate for FE is close to
that of Lay et al. (2005). Incidently, at this level of approximation, there
1s equipartition between kinetic and potential energy. It is also important
to point out that a tsunami being a shallow water wave, the whole water
column 1s moving as the wave propagates. For the parameter values used so
far, the maximum horizontal current is 3 cm/s. However, as the water depth
decreases, the current increases and becomes important when the depth be-
comes less than 500 m. Additional properties of solitary waves can be found
for example in Longuet-Higgins [1974].
5 Tsunami run-up

The last phase of a tsunami is its run-up and inundation. Although in
some cases it may be important to consider the coupling between fluid and
structures, we restrict ourselves to the description of the fluid flow. The
problem of waves climbing a beach is a classical one Carrier and Greenspan
1958]. The transformations used by Carrier and Greenspan are still used
nowadays. The basis of their analysis is the one-dimensional counterpart of
the system (34)—(36). In addition, they assume the depth to be of uniform
slope: h = —x tan. Introduce the following dimensionless quantities, where
