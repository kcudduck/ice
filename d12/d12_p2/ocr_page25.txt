5 Tsunami run-up 25
The elimination of x results in the linear second-order equation for ¢

a (tx — too) — 3t, = 0. (49)
Since u + ttanf = A/2, u must also satisfy (49). Introducing the potential
¢(o, X) such that

te

one obtains the equation
(0h )o — TDA = 0

after integrating once. Two major simplifications have been obtained. The
nonlinear set of equations have been reduced to a linear equation for u or ¢
and the free boundary is now the fixed line 0 = 0 in the (0, A\)—plane. The
free boundary is the instantaneous shoreline ¢ = 0, which moves as a wave
climbs a beach.

The above formulation has been used by several authors to study the
run-up of various types of waves on sloping beaches Carrier et al. [2003],
Tadepalli and Synolakis [1994], Tinti and Tonini [2005]. For example, it has
been shown that leading depression N-waves run-up higher than leading
elevation N-waves, suggesting that perhaps the solitary wave model may
not be adequate for predicting an upper limit for the run-up of near-shore
generated tsunamis.

There is a rule of thumb that says that the run-up does not usually exceed
twice the fault slip. Since run-ups of 30 meters were observed in Sumatra
during the Boxing Day tsunami, the slip might have been of 15 meters or
even more.

Analytical models are useful, especially to perform parametric studies.
However, the breaking of tsunami waves as well as the subsequent floodings
must be studied numerically. The most natural methods that can be used are
the free surface capturing methods based on a finite volume discretisation,
such as the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) or the Level Set methods, and the family
of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics methods (SPH), applied to free-surface
flow problems Gomez-Gesteira et al. [2005], Gomez-Gesteira and Dalrymple
2004], Monaghan [1994]. Such methods allow a study of flood wave dynam-
ics, of wave breaking on the land behind beaches, and of the flow over rising
eround with and without the presence of obstacles. This task is an essential
part of tsunami modelling, since it allows the determination of the level of
risk due to major flooding, the prediction of the resulting water levels in the
flooded areas, the determination of security zones. It also provides some help
in the conception and validation of protection systems in the most exposed
areas.
