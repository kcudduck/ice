potential ¢ can be expressed in terms of ¢, and w, only. Finally, one obtains
the velocity field in the whole water column (—h < z < 71) Madsen et al.
2003]:
u(z,y,z,t) = cos(zV)u, + sin(zV)w,, (42)
w(x, y, zt) = cos(zV)w, —sin(z2V)u,. (43)
Here the cosine and sine operators are infinite Taylor series operators defined
by

9) = 3 Go 9) = 3 Gr

Then one can substitute the representation (42)-(43) into the kinematic
bottom condition and use successive approximations to obtain an explicit
recursive expression for w, in terms of u, to infinite order in AV.

A wide variety of Boussinesq systems can been derived Madsen et al.
2003]. One can generalize the expansions to an arbitrary z—level, instead of
the z = 0 level. The Taylor series for the cosine and sine operators can be
truncated, Padé approximants can be used in operators at z = —h and/or
at z = 0.

The classical Boussinesq equations are more transparent when written in
the dimensionless variables used in the previous subsection. We further as-
sume that h is constant, drop the tildes, and write the equations for one spa-
tial dimension (x). Performing the expansion about z = 0 leads to the van-
ishing of the odd terms in the velocity potential. Substituting the expression
for ¢ into the free-surface boundary conditions evaluated at z = 1 + an(x, t)
leads to two equations in n and ¢, with terms of various order in « and f[.
The small parameters a and 5 are of the same order, while n and ¢, as well
as their partial derivatives are of order one.

3.5 Classical Boussinesq equations

The classical Boussinesq equations are obtained by keeping all terms that
are at most linear in « or (#3. In the derivation of the fundamental non-
linear shallow-water equations (31)—(33), the terms in 3 were neglected. It
is therefore implicitly assumed that the Stokes number is large. Since the
cube of the water depth appears in the denominator of the Stokes number
(S = a/f = al?/d?), it means that the Stokes number is 64 times larger in a
1 km depth than in a 4 km depth! Based on these arguments, dispersion is
