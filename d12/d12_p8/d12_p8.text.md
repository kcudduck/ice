In this study, we propose a tsunami generation  procedur e for the free generation of tsunami waves using  Navier -- Stokes   solver.   The time series   of   the tsunami  surface elevation and derived wave velocity are interpolated  in an open - source Navier - Stokes solver   –  interFoam   --   for  the generation of tsuna mi waves.   The   analytical   funct ion  form   d eriving the   wave v elocity   is :  𝑢 ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡 )  =   𝑢 ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡   −   𝛥𝑡 )  ±   √ 1  2   (   ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡 )  ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡   −   𝛥𝑡 )   +   1 )   (   ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡 )  ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡   −   𝛥𝑡 )   −   1 )  2  (   ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡 )  ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡   −   𝛥𝑡 ) )  − 2  𝑔 ℎ ( 𝑥 ,   𝑡 ) .   ( 1 )  The wave records of the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011  Tohoku tsunami events are reproduced by the Navier -  Stokes solver for the first time. In addition, the credibility of  the model for long - wave generation, propagation, and run -  up   is   validated   agai nst   laboratory   measurements.   The  general   results   suggest   that   the   tsunami   generation  procedure is feasible and that  interFoam   is an excellent  option   for   tsunami   wave   modeling.   Without   the   linear  shallow water approximation, the procedure can be us ed to  model   leading - depression   tsunami   waves   of   high  nonlinearity.

Comparisons of surface elevations of the  (c) 2004 Indian Ocean and (d) 2011 Tohoku tsunamis. Star  symbol: field - measured   wave - height record; black curve:  fitted   wave - height   function;   red   solid   curve:   transient  variation in the modeled surface elevation at   the wave  entrance;   red   dashed   curve:   transient   variation   in   the  modeled surface elevation at a distance of 5 km from the  wave entrance.  T he run - up mechanism of the leading - depression tsunami  waves is investigated. Spatial and temporal variations in the  surface   elevation,   flow   contour,   and   velocity   field   are  pres ented. The results indicate that a stronger leading  trough may induce a longer wave recession distance before  the elevated wave arrives and a higher wave run - up at a  later time. With the increase of the trough amplitude, the  seaward and landward velocities   of the wave are both  intensified. The leading trough steepens the wave front of  the elevated wave and potentially triggers wave breaking  during the run - up.  Fig u r e   2   –   Panels (b) and (c) depict the flow contours and  velocity fields when the wave front of the elevated wave  occurs   at   half   of   the   slope   for   𝐴 𝑡 / 𝐴   =   0.5   and   1.0,  respectively.   𝐴 𝑡   is the depth of the   leading t rough.   𝐴   i s the  height of the wave crest.   Panels (e) and (f) depict the flow  contours   and   velocity   fields   when   a   maximum   receding  distance is reached. Panels (a) and (b) for   𝐴 𝑡 / 𝐴   =   0.0 are  plotted for contrast. The plots are not to scale.  Furthermore, our investigation delves into the wave run - up

T he outcomes of our study reveal a  crucial dependency on the precise on - site measurements of  both   wave height   and   period for accurate   predictions.  Employing this specific data, we can successfully employ  the analytical solution developed b y Madsen   &   Sch ä   ffer  ( 20 10)   to forecast wave run - up height.
