height of tsunami waves, specifically considering the
influence of varying wave non-linearity H /D , where
H represents the initial wave height, and D stands for the
initial water depth. The outcomes of our study reveal a
crucial dependency on the precise on-site measurements of
both wave height and period for accurate predictions.
Employing this specific data, we can successfully employ
the analytical solution developed by Madsen & Schaffer
(2010) to forecast wave run-up height.
