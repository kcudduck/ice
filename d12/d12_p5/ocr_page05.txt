of any wave, a corresponds to the negative amplitude of an N- 700
wave; and |a| + |a~| = H (for an elevated wave, a = H). Ep is the to-
tal potential energy of a given wave. For N-waves, this can be split 600
into the potential energy of the trough, E,, and the potential energy
of the peak, E,, (for elevated waves, E, = Ep). p is the water density, £00
and g is the acceleration due to gravity. =

The wave generator used in this study is described in Rossetto
et al. (2011). The novel element of the generator is that it generates 100
waves pneumatically by raising and lowering the water free-sur-
face within an enclosed tank, placed at one end of the wave flume. q |
