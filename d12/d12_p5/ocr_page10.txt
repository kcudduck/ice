Data
Fig. 10. (a) Residual plot corresponding to the best fit for wave group E in < 1, This plot shows that the data is evenly distributed around the mean, within 2.5 standard
deviations (i.e., good fit of the regression curve to the data). (b) Normal probability plot of the residuals: the normal distribution is represented by the red line, the
corresponding distribution of the data is represented by the blue crosses. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web

Fig. 11. Results of the regression analysis for wave group E T < 1. (a) Equation (18) is represented in red, the 95% confidence intervals for the predicted variable are
represented in blue dashes, and the 95% confidence intervals for the regression parameters are represented in green dashes (i.e., the maximum and minimum regression fit at
this level of confidence is contained within the green asymptotes). The outliers (not taken into account in the regression) are represented in red. (b) Power law (19) and
corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the predicted variable (in blue dashes),as well as 95% confidence intervals for the regression parameters k and K (in green dashes).
The coordinates of the outliers (waves 6 and 7) are respectively (0.28; 0.21) and (0.27; 0.18). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure caption, the reader is
