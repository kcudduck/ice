Fig. 8. Scatter plot of variables potentially influential on runup, here for long N-waves. A trend can be observed in all graphs except for wavelength. However for consistency
with the analysis of elevated waves, all parameters are included in the N-wave runup analysis. The plot for positive and negative potential energy indicates that there is a
balance between both potential energies during the wave runup process.
