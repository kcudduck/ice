ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Article history: Tsunami are propagating waves characterized by long wavelengths and large amplitudes close to the
Received 10 September 2012 shore. They may also have a profile characterised by a large trough preceding the positive wave. These

To analyse the influence of wavelength and wave shape on runup, the experimental data was parti-
tioned into groups classified by wave period T/T, (where Tj is the travel time of a linear wave along
the length of the beach) and wave shape (elevated or N-waves). In this paper, elevated waves refer to
waves of translation having a single positive elevation above mean water level, and N-waves refer to
waves of translation comprising both a negative elevation (below mean water level) and a positive ele-
vation. Dimensional analysis (using experimentally determined wavelength, potential energy and wave
amplitudes) was applied to identify correlated measures. A statistical analysis was used to determine a
power law relationship between runup and measures of the waveform, and to test the significance of
the power law hypothesis. The experimental results show how both the wavelength and wave shape
influence the runup distance. For i < 1, the runup is seen to scale as R ~ a, while for i > 1, it scales
as R ~ v/a.
