coast of Japan were less than 1 m. A similar result was published by JMA [44]. The city of Sendai, the
capital of Miyagi Prefecture, was closest to the epicenter (130 km away), was hard hit and experienced
a severe tsunami wave height greater than 7.6 m [44]. The current model predicted it to be 9.3 m. At the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, JMA published wave height to be greater than 9.3 m [44]; the
current model predicted it to be 14.4 m. Figure 4b shows that the tsunami propagated throughout the
Pacific Ocean region, reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to
Chile. The wave reached the North American coasts in about 10-12 h and the South American coast in
about 17-20 h, which can be visualized in figure 4c. Tsunami warnings were issued, and evacuations
were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific. The tsunami heights resulting from the
earthquake were measured across various locations globally. In New Zealand, the Chatham Islands
(figure 5; chit, wait) and New Zealand's coast (figure 5; sumt) experienced a 0.5 m tsunami. In North
America, Canada (figure 5; hens, wint) recorded heights greater than 0.5 m, the USA (figure 5; aren,
char, cres) saw tsunami height exceeding 1 m, Mexico (figure 5; acap, acya, manz) reported a 1 m
