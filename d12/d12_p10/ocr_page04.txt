an international group of experts in ocean mapping who aim to provide the most authoritative
publicly available bathymetry of the world’s oceans. GEBCO provides a high-resolution global grid
with 30 arc-second spacing, widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive and accurate global : ZS
bathymetric datasets available. This 30 arc-sec data from GEBCO is used for the bathymetry for the Z
global domain. Figure 1 illustrates the global model domain along with bathymetry on a Robinson : =
projection generated using OceanMesh2D and the bathymetry employed in the current study. The =
mesh consists of 3 458 668 nodes and 6 628 428 triangular elements. The global mesh resolution | =
varies depending on the depth of the water. The mesh has a fine resolution of 2 km in shallow areas : =
near coastline waters, where capturing accurate wave behaviour is crucial. In deeper waters further : 5
away from land, the mesh coarsens to 20 km. This optimization balances accuracy with computational =
efficiency, ensuring the model can simulate vast stretches of the ocean without exceeding pre- and | 5
post-processing limitations. Figure 2 displays an unstructured mesh (on Mercator projection) over a : =

In the current study, we have utilized a global unstructured mesh with variable spatial —-
resolution, with a finer resolution of 2 km in shallow waters and a coarser resolution of up | w
to 20 km in deep ocean waters. This variable resolution is critical for capturing the different =
characteristics of tsunami waves in deep water versus shallow water. The rationale for this : IS
variable resolution is to capture detailed nearshore processes, where finer resolution is essential : &
for accurately modelling wave propagation while maintaining computational efficiency in the deep ~
ocean, where local bathymetric features has less influence on tsunami dynamics. Tsunami waves iy
have very long wavelengths (often exceeding 100 km) in deep waters, where the ocean’s depth : &
primarily influences the wave speed. In such regions, a coarser resolution (20 km) is sufficient .
because the wave characteristics do not require fine-scale bathymetric detail to be accurately
resolved. The long wavelength means large grid cells can capture the wave dynamics without
compromising accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency. As tsunami waves approach the
coastline, their wavelength shortens significantly due to the shallower depth, leading to a complex
wave behaviour such as amplification. In these coastal regions, finer mesh resolution (2 km)
is essential to accurately resolve the shorter wavelengths and the interaction of the wave with
complex coastal topography. A finer resolution ensures that the steep gradients in bathymetry
near the shore are well-represented, allowing the model to accurately capture the amplification
and run-up processes. The resolution choices in the current work align with those discussed in
[27], where a similar resolution range (~2-20 km) was used in global ocean models for storm tide
simulations.
The ADCIRCvV55 model was run on 480 Intel Sandy Bridge Processors on the HPC system, and
its run time was about 10 min for 30 h of model simulation for propagation using 1296 processors.
This article used a time step of 2 s and a quadratic bottom friction of value 0.028 to simulate tsunami
propagation. The ADCIRC model solves the generalized wave continuity equation, which introduces a
numerical parameter, TAUO, that weights the SWE. In the current simulations, a value of TAUO = 0.05,
constant in space and time in line with [30] is taken to conserve the mass (electronic supplementary
material, figure S3). The model outputs wave heights at every grid point at a specified time interval.
The simulated wave heights for the entire grid are saved for every five min, and these wave heights are
compared against available tide gauge observations. The computation time can be further optimized
to five min if the output is requested only at the coastal focal points instead of all the grid points.
The tide gauge observations are extracted from the website https://www.ioc-sealevelmonitoring.org/
[31]. The Sea Level Station Monitoring Facility (SLSMF) is a website developed and maintained by the
Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) for the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) [32] of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The SLSMF provides
worldwide information about the data and the operational status of real-time sea level monitoring
stations. It is an important tool for monitoring sea level changes, providing tsunami warnings and
protecting coastal communities. The SLSMF is a valuable resource for scientists, policymakers and
the public. The locations of various observations used in the current study are shown in figure 3
(on Mercator projection), and the respective locations, along with their code and country names, are
given in table 1. The tide gauge observations from the IOC sea level were collected from various
locations where wave height was significant (=0.5 m) due to tsunami, and residuals were computed.
Residuals were computed by removing astronomical tide components from the tide gauge records to
obtain the water levels solely due to the tsunami wave. These residuals were computed using UTIDE
[33] and compared with the model computed water levels due to tsunami at available tide gauge
locations. Computed travel times were also validated using available observations. The use of UTIDE,
