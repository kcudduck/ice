Figure 5. Comparison of the computed tsunami wave heights against the tide gauge observations at various global locations for the
Japan 2011 event. The red colour corresponds to tide gauge observations, and the blue colour represents a numerical simulation. The
locations of the tide gauge stations shown as titles on each subplot are marked in figure 3 and shown in table 1. The x-axis represents
the time stamp, and the y-axis represents the wave height amplitude in meters. The starting time in the abscissa in each subplot is

tsunami. Costa Rica (figure 5; gepo) observed a 0.5 m tsunami. In South America, Ecuador (figure 5;
lali) faced a tsunami exceeding 1 m, while Peru (figure 5; atic, call) recorded heights surpassing 0.5 m.
Chile experienced varying tsunami heights in different locations, with Antofagasta (figure 5; anto) at 1
m, Arica (figure 5; aric) at 2 m and several other locations (figure 5; cald, const, coqu, corr, iqui, lebu,
talc, valp) reporting heights ranging from 1 to 2 m. Russia's island of Kors (figure 5; kors) witnessed a
0.5 m tsunami. Among the USA islands, Adak (figure 5; adak) experienced a 1 m tsunami, and several
others (figure 5; dutc, hono, nawi, midx, sdpt) reported tsunamis of greater than or equal to 0.5 m.
Additionally, the Chilean island of Sanf (figure 5; sanf) faced a 0.5 m tsunami, while Ecuador’s islands,
including Balt (figure 5; balt) and Sant (figure 5; sant), reported heights exceeding 0.5 and 1 m, respec-
tively.
Figure 6 compares observed and simulated values for the amplitude of the first peak and its
arrival time at various stations shown in figure 5 for the 2011 Japan tsunami event. The stations
in figure 6 (bottom to top) are sorted by distance from the epicentre. The model predicted much
larger amplitudes for nearby stations (hana, omae and losa), possibly because of the used tsunami’s
initial deformation. From figure 6, it is evident that the differences in amplitude range from -1.37
m at hana to 0.02 m at manz, with most values being negative, indicating that the model generally
overestimates the peak amplitude compared to observations. However, the differences are small in
many cases, such as kors (0.05 m) and hens (0.05 m), suggesting a good match between observed
and simulated first peak amplitudes. From figure 6, the first peak arrival times are generally close
to the observed times. Stations like kwaj (6.6598) and hens (6.6598) have minimal discrepancies,
indicating high accuracy in timing predictions. The statistical parameters shown in figure 6 further
support the model's reliability for arrival times, demonstrating an almost perfect match. The statistical
metrics shown for amplitudes indicate a tendency for slight overestimation but generally accurate
