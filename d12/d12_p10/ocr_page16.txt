shown in table 3. The distribution of peak tsunami wave height simulated using current methodology
is shown in figure 10b. Travel time contours of tsunami waves at every 1 h interval are displayed in
figure 10c. Figure 10b,c is on Robinson's projection. Figure 100 depicts that the countries India, Sri
Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia and Thailand experience tsunami heights greater than 2 m. The tsunami
wave took 2-3 h after the earthquake to reach Indian coasts.
The simulated time series of water levels at different global locations are compared against the IOC
sea level observations in figure 11. Red lines represent the observations, while blue lines show the
model simulation in figure 11. Figure 11 conveys that the model is capturing the timing and amplitude
