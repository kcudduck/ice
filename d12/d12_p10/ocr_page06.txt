Second, several statistical metrics are employed to quantity the accuracy and reliability of the ADCIRC
model simulations against the observations for the entire simulation length. Regression (R) analysis
is conducted to explore the relationship between the observed heights and model wave heights. The
statistical significance (SS) in percentage is also shown along with R. The normalized root mean
square deviation (NRMSD) is used to assess the overall deviation of the simulated values from
the observed values, providing a dimensionless measure that facilitates comparison across different
scales of values. The normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD) quantifies the average normal-
ized absolute difference between predicted and observed values, which is crucial for understanding
worst-case scenarios. The normalized Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NNSE) is also calculated to evaluate
the model's performance relative to the mean observed data. The metrics used for model performance
evaluation are detailed in table 2, along with the minimum, maximum and best possible values
for each performance metric, along with the respective formulae. Though we have used the above
statistical metrics, it should be noted that there will be mismatches between the simulated model
results and observations, particularly in terms of arrival times. This discrepancy can negatively affect
metrics like R, which may appear less favourable due to timing mismatches, even when the overall
model performance is good.

Discrepancies between ADCIRC model predictions and tide gauge data, particularly in wave
heights and arrival times, arise from factors like bathymetric data limitations, fault parameters,
numerical model assumptions and aftershocks. These factors are discussed below in brief.

(1) Bathymetry: The resolution and accuracy of the bathymetry, particularly in coastal and shallow

water regions, play a crucial role in wave propagation and amplification. The bathymetric data
used (from the GEBCO dataset) is of high resolution but may contain inaccuracies in certain
nearshore regions due to limited surveys. These inaccuracies, if any, can result in local errors in
wave height prediction, either amplifying or reducing the model's estimates.

(2) Initial seismic fault parameters: The accuracy of tsunami generation relies heavily on the initial
fault parameters, such as slip, rupture length and depth. Minor uncertainties in these parame-
ters, which are derived from seismic data, can affect the initial sea surface displacement and,
consequently, the tsunami wave characteristics. For example, variations in the estimated slip
distribution across the fault can lead to over- or underestimation of the wave heights, especially
near the source.

(3) Numerical model: The ADCIRC model solves the SWE, which, while effective for long-wave
propagation, does not account for dispersive effects or water compressibility. In deep waters,
these effects are negligible, but as tsunamis approach the coast, neglecting dispersive behaviour
can lead to early wave arrival times. Studies like [35] have shown that frequency dispersion
