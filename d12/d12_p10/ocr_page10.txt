On 11 March 2011, at 05:46 UTC (local time 14:46), a subduction megathrust earthquake with a moment S
magnitude of 9 Mw occurred 30 km below the ocean floor off the northeastern coast of Honshu, —
Tohoku, Japan [36]. This is Japan's strongest earthquake ever recorded and the fourth strongest : «wv
globally since 1900. This earthquake is also called the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake or the Great East =
Japan Earthquake. The earthquake caused widespread destruction on the land and triggered a giant IS
tsunami that devasted many coastal regions of Japan [39]. This massive earthquake and subsequent <
tsunami caused severe damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, leading to meltdowns, —
hydrogen—air explosions and the release of significant radiation leaks. Hundreds of thousands of
people were evacuated due to the nuclear threat. It was the most severe nuclear disaster since the : 35
Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which challenged the nuclear communities across the world to reassess : 2
nuclear power safety measures [40]. Figure 4a shows the computed initial deformation for the 2011
Japan earthquake. The focal fault parameters used for generating this initial deformation are taken
from [36] and are shown in table 3. The maximum simulated tsunami wave height distribution over
the entire simulation is displayed in figure 4b. Travel time contours of tsunami waves at every 1 h
interval are shown in figure 4c. Figure 5 compares observations and model-simulated water levels at
different locations over the globe. All these observations are taken from the IOC sea level website and
are plotted in alphabetic order based on the station ID. The observations are averaged to five min
from one min and displayed in figure 5. The tide gauge ID, country and location name are given
as titles on each subplot, which can be accessed from table 1 for further information. From figure 5,
the blue curves representing the ADCIRC simulations generally track the red curves representing the
observations fairly close. This suggests that the model is doing a good job of capturing the timing
and general shape of the tsunami waves for most of the stations. It can be observed from figure 5
that at most of the stations, the peak tsunami wave is slightly overestimated, and the wave arrival
is a few minutes (about 10 min) earlier. One can compromise with this kind of model behaviour
from an operational perspective as this leads to early evacuation measures, and timings can be taken
sooner. There are some exceptions where the blue curves diverge from the red curves. For example,
at the core, dutc, cebu, lomb, sand, etc. stations, the model predicts a larger wave than the observed
one. This suggests that the model may not be predicting the exact observed wave height, but it is
still doing a good job of approximating reality in most cases. A possible reason for the mismatch
could be because of the uncertainties involved in the generation mechanism of initial deformation [41].
Discrepancies in bathymetry [42,43] and/or the bottom friction used at the location can also result in
these mismatches, as the accuracy of the wave computations largely depends on the accuracy of these
parameters. Similarly, the underestimation after the initial peaks can be noticed in some instances.
A possible reason for this might be that the simulations do not include aftershocks from the actual
earthquake. Japan experienced over 1000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over
magnitude 6.0 Mw and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 Mw. A magnitude 7.4 Mw at
15:08 (JST), 7.9 Mw at 15:15 and a 7.7 Mw quake at 15:26 all occurred on 11 March. While modelling
tsunamis, incorporating these aftershocks can lead to an accurate estimation of wave heights over the
entire simulation period. As aforementioned, discrepancies in the bathymetry data may also contribute
to the mismatch in these instances, too.
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has issued the most severe tsunami warning, rating it as a
major tsunami. A tsunami hit Japan's coast within an hour (figure 4c) of the earthquake. From figure
4b, it can be seen that the northeastern part of Japan's coast (refer figure 5 at hana, omae locations)
faced tsunami wave heights greater than 2 m, and southeastern part (refer figure 5, tosa location) had
tsunami wave heights greater than 1 m. Figure 4b depicts that the tsunami wave heights on the west
