The major steps involved in the numerical simulation of the tsunami are generation and propagation. =
Generation includes generating initial disturbance of sea level due to underwater earthquakes using | 5
the deformation model once the seismic fault parameters such as earthquake location (longitude, |
latitude, depth), magnitude, fault geometry (strike, dip, rake, length and width) and slip, are obtained. | &
The Okada deformation model [21] is used in the current study. Propagation is the flow of this —-
displaced volume of sea surface water under gravity towards the coast. An SWE solver simulates |
propagation [27] and demonstrates the ADCIRCv55 capability for global simulation of storm tides for =
two intense storms, Hurricane Katrina and Super Typhoon Haiyan. This article compared ADCIRCv55 IS
simulations with real-world data for astronomical and storm tides induced by hurricanes; the results : &
demonstrated good agreement, validating the model's accuracy and reliability. Both tsunami and ~
storm surges are shallow-water gravity waves, although their generation and forcing conditions yg
differ [24]. The current article makes use of ADCIRCv55 to simulate the propagation of tsunamis. : &
This current version of ADCIRC can be downloaded from https://github.com/adcirc. ADCIRC solves i
the SWEs numerically by discretizing the continuous equations on an unstructured mesh with the
Finite E method [25]. ADCIRCV55 is the apt choice for the current work compared to its previous
versions. V55 utilizes an accurate modified form of the SWE in spherical coordinates, capturing the
essential tide and wave dynamics in deep and shallow waters with varying scales in larger domains
like the entire globe [27]. To accurately compute the governing equations on the entire globe, the
model formulation and the code were enhanced [27]. This improvement includes rotating the Earth
to eliminate pole singularities. V55 introduces new numerical techniques that remove gravity wave-
based (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) stability constraints, which allows for larger computational time
steps, significantly boosting simulation speed without compromising accuracy. The newly introduced
semi-implicit time integration scheme is computationally effective and is 1-2 times faster than the
previous versions of ADCIRC.

The quality and design of the unstructured mesh play a crucial role in successfully solving the
SWEs with ADCIRC. The global unstructured mesh in the current study is generated using an
open-source toolbox OceanMesh2D 3.0.0 (Robert et al., 2019). OceanMesh2D is a specialized software
based on MATLAB that generates ocean meshes compatible with various ocean models, including
ADCIRC. The software has a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation with a
script-driven automatic mesh generation approach. This automated approach ensures consistency and
efficiency without manual editing, saving time and reducing potential errors while creating complex
meshes. It integrates with various data sources, importing bathymetry and coastline information to
guide the mesh generation process. It also accurately captures complex coastlines and bathymetry,
leading to more realistic wave propagation and inundation simulations. OceanMesh2D supports
adaptive mesh resolution by meshing with smaller triangles (fine resolution) in the coastal waters
and employing larger triangles (coarse resolution) in deeper waters; this adaptive resolution optimizes
computational resources, leading to faster simulations. The global mesh for global tsunami simulations
in the current article is built in a stereographic projection centred at the North Pole. This projection
preserves angles on the sphere, making it well-suited for accurately representing a realistic global
ocean. The mesh seamlessly wraps around the entire Earth, including an element placed over the
North Pole. This avoids artificial discontinuities at the poles, which can cause simulation issues. The
unstructured triangular mesh on the spherical earth accurately conforms to the coastline and covers
a spatial resolution range of 2-20 km. The OceanMesh2D inbuilt full-resolution Global Self-consistent
Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines (GSHHS) dataset [28] is used to define the shoreline boundary
while generating the mesh. This toolbox can be downloaded from https://github.com/CHLNDDEV/
OceanMesh2D.

The accuracy and quality of bathymetric data are critical for generating unstructured meshes
using OCEANMESH2D for ADCIRC simulations. The present study’s bathymetric data is sourced
from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) [29] dataset. The GEBCO comprises
