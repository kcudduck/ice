Figure 13. Comparison of observed and simulated first peak values for travel time and amplitude for the Indian Ocean tsunami event
of 26 December 2004. The location of each station is indicated in figure 3, and the details are shown in table 1.
completely depend on the initial deformation, bathymetry and the physical parameters used for the
modelling. From figure 15, the highest recorded first peak arrival heights were observed at Yakutat,
Alaska (figure 15; yaku), with a height of 1.3 m, followed closely by Sitka, Alaska (figure 15; sitk) at 1
m. These observations indicate the tsunami’s impact on coastal areas closer to the epicentre. Moving
away from Alaska, the tsunami waves travelled southwestward, affecting coastal regions along the
Pacific Ocean. As the waves propagated across the Pacific Ocean, their heights gradually reduced at
locations farther from the earthquake’s epicentre. For instance, coastal locations in Washington state
and California, such as Neah Bay (figure 15; neah), San Francisco and Los Angeles, recorded lower first
peak arrival heights ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 m. Ensenada, Mexico (figure 15; ense), experienced a high
first peak arrival height of 0.9 m, indicating the continued propagation of the tsunami across the Pacific
Ocean. The tsunami reached Peru and Chile with varying arrival heights, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 m at
locations such as Talara (figure 15; tala), La Punta (figure 15; call), Arica (figure 15; aric) and Talca-
huano (figure 15; talc). The tsunami waves travelled further across the Pacific Ocean, reaching the
Hawaiian Islands. Honolulu (figure 15; hono), Kahului (figure 15; kahu) and other Hawaiian locations
(figure 15; moku, midx) recorded arrival heights ranging from 0.2 to 1 m, indicating the impact of the
tsunami on these distant islands.
Figure 16 shows the observed and simulated values for the first peak arrival time and amplitude at
various stations during the Alaska 1964 tsunami event. The stations are arranged in ascending order
of distance from the epicentre (top to bottom). The majority of stations have perfect matches to small
differences in arrival times and amplitudes. Stations like 'yaku' and ‘alam’ exhibit differences in both
arrival times and amplitudes, highlighting the areas needing improvement. From figure 16 and looking
at the statistical performance metrics displayed, overall, the model performed well but requires further
refinement for consistent accuracy across all the stations. The electronic supplementary material, table
S56, presents various statistical metrics to evaluate the performance of ADCIRC-modelled tsunami wave
height across different stations, as shown in figure 15. Regression analysis shows high significance
percentages at many stations, suggesting a strong statistical reliability in the results. The NRMSD
