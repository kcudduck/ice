performance in predicting tsunami wave heights at various stations in the order shown in figure
11. Higher significance percentages across most of the stations indicate robust statistical reliability.
Notably, most of the stations demonstrate excellent model performance with low error metrics and
high efficiency. The stations jack, zanz show very poor regression but better NNSE, indicating the
model can be improved at these stations. While the model performs well in many regions, certain
stations with lower efficiency and higher deviation metrics highlight areas for further refinement and
improvement.
5.4. Alaska tsunami event 28 March 1964
The 1964 Alaskan earthquake, also known as the Great Alaskan earthquake, Prince William Sound and
Good Friday earthquake, occurred on 28 March 1960 at 03:36:00 UTC (Local time 27 [46] at 17:36:16).
This massive earthquake is the most powerful earthquake recorded in North American history and
the second-largest earthquake ever recorded globally. The earthquake was 9.2 Mw, and its epicentre
was north of Alaska’s Prince William Sound region. The earthquake ruptured a large area beneath
the continental margin of Alaska from Prince William Sound to Kodiak Island, triggering a tsunami.
The tsunami devastated Alaska, and the earthquake also generated multiple local tsunamis due to
submarine and subaerial landslides in coastal Alaska [47]. Figure 14a shows the initial deformation
generated due to the 1964 Alaska earthquake. This deformation is obtained using a finite fault solution
from [48]. A finite fault solution is a multi-fault representation of the rupture with variable local slip,
rake angle, depth, rise time and rupture velocity. Figure 14b,c display the distribution of peak tsunami
wave height simulated and travel time contours of tsunami waves at every 1 h interval for the current
tsunami. Figure 14b,c is on Robinson's projection. The deformation pattern shown in figure 14a, with
subsidence of 10 m and uplift of 5 m, is a typical megathrust earthquake in a subduction zone. Figure
