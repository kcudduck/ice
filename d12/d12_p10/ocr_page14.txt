5.2. Chile tsunami event 27 February 2010 ZS
On 27 February 2010, at 06:34:23 UTC (local time 03:34:23am), an earthquake of magnitude 8.9 Mw =
occurred approximately 325 km southwest of the Chilean capital of Santiago, off the coast of Chile's |
Maule region [37]. The earthquake occurred under 37 km depth and was characterized by a thrust —
forcing mechanism caused by the Nazca Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. This force | «
displaced large volumes of seawater above and triggered a tsunami. A tsunami warning was issued =
first for Chile and Peru; Chile was significantly affected by a tsunami, with over 500 deaths, leaving : IS
1000 s homeless and causing damage to properties and the economy [45]. The tsunami affected Chile's : &
coastline and generated warnings and evacuations across the Pacific Ocean, including as far away as ~
Japan, New Zealand and the west coast of the United States. Figure 7a shows the initial deformation yg
generated due to Chile's 2010 earthquake. The focal fault parameters to generate initial deformation : &
are shown in table 3. The distribution of peak tsunami wave height simulated using ADCIRC is shown .
in figure 7b. Travel time contours of tsunami waves at every 1 h interval are displayed in figure 7c.
The ADCIRC-simulated water levels at different global locations are compared against the IOC sea
level observations in figure 8. All these observations are taken from the IOC sea level website and are
plotted in alphabetic order based on the station ID. The observations are averaged to five min from
one min and displayed in figure 8. The tide gauge ID, country and location name are given as titles
on each subplot, which can be accessed from table 1 for further information. From figure 8, the blue
curves representing the ADCIRC simulations match the red curves representing the observations. The
model did a good job of capturing the timing and first-wave amplitude of the tsunami waves. It can be
observed from figure 8 that at most of the stations, the first peak tsunami height is slightly overestima-
ted, and the wave arrival is a few minutes earlier. Although the first wave arrived and was captured
at some locations, acap, anto, aric, manz, etc., the model underestimated the secondary tsunami wave
heights. This is because, after the earthquake, there were multiple aftershocks as mentioned in the
previous case, which would lead to tsunami waves, and these shocks are not considered in the current
simulations. The model results can be further improved by employing exact bathymetry information
and bottom friction information at the locations.

Figure 8 shows the widespread propagation of the 2010 Chile tsunami based on the different
tsunami wave heights at different coastal countries in the Pacific Ocean. Chile faced the devastating
blow, with waves greater than a metre high crashing into a few areas. Chile had waves ranging from
0.4 to 1.3 m in different cities like Ancud (figure 8; ancu), Coquimbo (figure 8; coqu) and Valparaiso
(figure 8; valp). Other countries closer to Chile, like Peru and Ecuador, faced waves less than a metre,
with Callao (figure 7; call), Peru, at 0.5 m and San Telmo (figure 8; sant), Ecuador, at 0.78 m. In North
America, places like Costa Rica, Mexico and the USA had smaller waves, ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 m.
While waves were generally smaller, San Diego (figure 8; sanb, sand) felt the highest peak at 0.6 m.
Costa Rica’s Quepos (figure 8; quepo) recorded a 0.4 m peak, while Mexican waves ranged from 0.3
m in Acapulco (figure 8; acap) to 0.5 m in Manzanillo (figure 8; manz). The wave’s energy weakened
but remained detectable further across the Pacific Ocean, away from North and South American
continents and to other continents. In Oceania, Samoa and New Zealand experienced tsunami with
waves between 0.2 and 0.5 m. Both Pago (figure 8; pago) and Upolu (figure 8; upol) in Samoa recorded
peaks of 0.5 and 0.2 m, respectively. New Zealand's Waitomo (figure 8; wait) saw a 0.5 m peak. In Asia,
Japan's coast saw a wave peak ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 m, with Hanasaki (figure 8; hana) experiencing
the highest. Even far away in Europe, an island saw a wave of 0.6 m (figure 8; hiva).

Figure 9 compares observed and simulated values for travel time and amplitude of the first
tsunami peak at various stations (sorted by distance from the epicentre, with the closest station at
the bottom) for the Chile tsunami event. Arrival times and amplitudes at multiple stations exhibit
minimal differences between observed and simulated values with very good performance metrics. For
most stations, the simulated tsunami wave arrived a few minutes earlier than observed (except for
