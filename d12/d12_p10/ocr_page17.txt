Figure 8. Comparison of the computed tsunami wave heights against the tide gauge observations at various global locations for the
Chile 2010 event. The red colour corresponds to tide gauge observations, and the blue colour represents a numerical simulation. The
locations of the tide gauge stations shown as titles on each subplot are marked in figure 3 and shown in table 1. The x-axis represents
the time stamp, and the y-axis represents the wave height amplitude in metres. The starting time in the abscissa in each subplot is
27-Feb—2010 06:34:23 UTC. (See electronic supplementary material, table 54, for statistical performance metrics.)
of the tsunami waves well, which is evident from stations like Mauritius (blueb), Sri Lanka (colo)
and the Maldives (ganm, male). There are some discrepancies between the model and observations at
some locations; the model underestimates the wave height at Chennai, India (chenn) and overestimates
at Lamu, Kenya (lamu). The model does not capture the smaller waves that arrived after the main
tsunami at some locations (figure 11; blueb, chenn, tuti), whereas the same are visible at stations like
Richards Bay, South Africa (rich) and Salalah, Oman (sala). The tsunami also reached Antarctica (figure
11; syow), which is captured in the current model and matches the observation well. Overall, the model
provides a good representation of the 2004 tsunami. However, the results can be further improved by
using the exact bathymetry and bottom friction coefficient. Figure 12 compares the ADCIRC computed
wave heights against the satellite altimeters measured heights at different time stamps. The satellite
altimetry data is downloaded from the link https://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/indo_1204.html. The top plots
in figure 12a—d illustrate the simulated propagation of the tsunami waves at 2.00 a.m., 2.05 a.m., 3.15
a.m. and 7.10 a.m. post the earthquake. These plots also show the satellite-traced path as a black line.
The bottom plots show the comparison of wave heights along the path against the satellite altimetry
measurement. It can be seen from the plots that ADCIRC is able to simulate the heights of the tsunami
waves accurately and is a good match with the satellite observations.
Figure 13 provides information on the first peak arrival time and amplitude between observed
and simulated values for the 26 December 2004 tsunami event across various stations. The stations
are sorted in ascending order (bottom to top) by distance from the epicentre. For the station ‘blueb’,
the first peak amplitude is missing from the observations, and it is not shown in figure 13. For all
the stations, the arrival times match well with the observations, showing good statistical performance
metrics. For stations 'chenn' and 'vish' the amplitudes are overestimated by a large value. A close
alignment between observations and simulations is indicated by smaller differences in both amplitude
and arrival time, which is also evident by the statistical performance metrics displayed in figure 13.
The electronic supplementary material, table S5, provides a comprehensive analysis of the models
