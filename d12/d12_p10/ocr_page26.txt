Figure 18. Comparison of the computed tsunami wave heights against the tide gauge observations at various global locations for the
Valdivia 1960 event. The red colour corresponds to tide gauge observations, and the blue colour represents a numerical simulation. The
locations of the tide gauge stations shown as titles on each subplot are marked in figure 3 and shown in table 1. The x-axis represents
the time stamp, and the y-axis represents the wave height amplitude in meters. The starting time in the abscissa in each subplot is 22
May 1960 19:11:20 UTC. (See electronic supplementary material, table S7, for statistical performance metrics.)
high-resolution bathymetry and accurate seismic fault parameters can significantly improve model
accuracy.

The current study demonstrates the successful application of the FE-based ADCIRC model for
global tsunami simulations, mainly focusing on distant tsunamis and assessing their threat to Indian
coasts. Through simulations of major historical tsunamis, such as the 2011 Japan, 2010 Chile, 2004
Indian Ocean, 1964 Alaska and 1960 Valdivia events, the research establishes ADCIRC’s reliability in
predicting tsunami wave heights and arrival times. Comparisons with tide gauge observations from
various global locations show a close alignment between model predictions and observed data, with
favourable statistical performance metrics confirming the model's accuracy. While slight overestima-
tions of peak wave heights and early arrival times were observed, this can be advantageous for
operational purposes, as it allows for earlier evacuations. The global unstructured mesh, with spatial
resolutions ranging from 2 km in shallow waters to 20 km in deeper regions, effectively balances
computational efficiency and simulation accuracy. The real-time simulation capabilities of ADCIRC
open avenues for enhanced global tsunami hazard modelling and risk mapping, offering critical
insights for TWC in identifying coastal hot spots and issuing timely warnings to mitigate potential
damages and save lives.

However, based on the findings in the study and the observed discrepancies between the model
and tide gauge data, there is scope for further improvement, which will be addressed in future work.

One area of focus will be the inclusion of astronomical tides in the computations, as local tides can
significantly influence tsunami wave behaviour. Additionally, aftershocks will be incorporated into the
model, enhancing its ability to account for secondary seismic events. Another important aspect is the
inclusion of local wind waves, particularly for regions like the Indian coasts, where high waves during
monsoons may contribute to the amplification of tsunami waves. Furthermore, the use of spatially
