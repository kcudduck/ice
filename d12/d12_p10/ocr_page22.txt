and NMAD values are relatively low, implying a decent match between observed and simulated
wave heights. The NNSE values are mostly above 0.3 (except at stations call, mata), with several
stations exceeding 0.4, reflecting good predictive accuracy and model performance. Overall, the model
demonstrates competent performance in predicting tsunami wave heights but shows variability in
accuracy across different stations.
5.5. Valdivia tsunami event 22 May 1960
The 1960 Valdivia earthquake, also known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, occurred on 22 May 2006
at 19:11:20 UTC (local time 22 May 1960 15:11:14) near Valdivia in Southern Chile. The earthquake
had a magnitude of 9.5, making it the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. This megathrust
earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that affected the coastal countries across the Pacific Ocean.
