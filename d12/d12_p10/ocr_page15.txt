station fpnt). Additionally, the simulated amplitudes are consistently closer to or match the observa-
tions. Furthermore, statistical parameters displayed in figure 9 support the model's reliability for both
arrival times and amplitudes. These parameters demonstrate a good agreement between modelled and
observed values (electronic supplementary material, table S54), providing a more detailed evaluation of
the model's performance at various stations (shown in figure 8) using statistical metrics for tsunami
wave heights. Many stations show strong correlations and high significance levels. Additionally, high
NNSE values with lower NRMSD and NMAD indicate accurate simulations. Overall, the model
effectively captured the tsunami behaviour at all stations, demonstrating good performance across
the domain with high significance and acceptable error metrics.
5.3. Indian ocean event 26 December 2004
The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, or the Boxing Day tsunami, is one of the deadliest natural disasters
in recorded history. The tsunami was triggered by a massive undersea megathrust earthquake of
9.1-9.3 magnitude struck off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia and generated widespread
destruction across countries bordering the Indian Ocean. Around 230000 people died, thousands
of people went missing, and millions of people were displaced from the coast [24]. In addition to
human casualties, the impact was also felt in terms of economic losses and damage to infrastructure.
Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and the Maldives were the most severely affected nations. The
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness and international
cooperation, leading to the development of new tsunami warning centres and enhanced tsunami early
detection systems in the region, emphasizing the need for improved global collaboration to mitigate
the impact of future catastrophic events [4]. Figure 10a shows the initial deformation generated due
to the 26 December 2004 earthquake. The focal fault parameters are taken from Grilli ef al. and are
