Figure 10. (a) Initial deformation of sea level. (b) Simulated maximum wave amplitude distribution. (c) Travel time contours of
tsunami wave due to Indian Ocean tsunami event 26 December 2004. (The figure is on Robinson projection.)
14b shows that the coastal locations of the Alaska region have experienced wave heights greater than 2
m.
Figure 15 shows the time series of ADCIRC simulated water levels at different locations against the
observations. The red and blue lines represent the observations and model simulations, respectively.
The x-axis displays the time in hours after the earthquake’s origin time, and the y-axis shows the water
level in metres relative to sea level. The titles on each subplot show the station code and location as per
the IOC sea level website. The observations are taken at various tide stations along Alaska’s coastlines
and other locations extending to South America and the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. The observations
used for the current tsunami are taken from [46]. Figure 15 shows that the model could capture the
aspects of the tsunami, but there are slight discrepancies with the observations at a few locations.
The model matches the arrival time of the first wave peak at most locations very well, but at a few
locations, it slightly underestimates the water level. The model appears to capture the wave behav-
iour and overall trend against observation. Furthermore, the discrepancies in the model predictions
