Figure 19. Comparison of observed and simulated first peak values for travel time and amplitude for the Valdivia tsunami event on 22
May 1960. The location of each station is indicated in figure 3, and the details are shown in table 1.
varying Manning coefficients and bottom friction data across the domain will improve model accuracy
in simulating coastal impacts. These advancements will contribute to more precise and operationally
efficient tsunami predictions.
