valuable and helped scientists understand plate tectonics, prompting advancements in seismological
research and monitoring. Figure 174 shows the initial deformation generated due to the 1960 Valdivia
earthquake. This deformation is obtained by employing a finite fault solution. The finite fault solution : ZS
used to generate the initial deformation is taken from [38]. A finite fault solution is a multi-fault Z
representation of the rupture with variable local slip, rake angle, depth, rise time and rupture velocity. : =

slip distribution can be avoided by using finite fault solution. Furthermore, tsunami waves arrived at a i
few locations after the first peak (figure 18; acap, cald, cres, sanm, etc.), but the model underestimated
this. This could be due to aftershocks not being considered in the current simulations. Also, this might
be due to the time dependencies in dynamic rupture along the fault, which is not considered in the
current simulations. The tsunami travelled great distances across the Pacific Ocean and affected several
countries. The earthquake’s epicentre was off the coast of Chile, and the country experienced devastat-
ing effects along the coastal regions (figure 18; talc, valp, coqu, anto, cald, aric). The tsunami had an
impact in Peru (figure 18; mata, call, chimb, tala), USA (figure 18; cres, hono, john, losa, neah,sanm,
sand, fpnt, sitk, dutc) and Mexico (figure 14; acap, ense, lpaz2, maza, sali). The tsunami reached far
Japan (figure 18; Monbetsu, Urakawa, hako, Tsuziki, Maizuru, Moji, Sasebo), Taiwan (figure 18; thua)
and the Philippines (figure 18; Hondagua, ega) causing destruction and few casualties.
Figure 19 shows observed and simulated values of the first peak arrival time and the first peak
amplitude along with statistical performance metrics across various stations for the Valdivia tsunami.
The stations are arranged from bottom to top in ascending order w.r.t. distance from the epicentre.
From figure 19, it can be conveyed that the model shows good performance at most of the stations,
with arrival times close to the observations with minimal amplitude differences. For a few stations,
VALPARAISO, UNALASKA and SASEBO, the amplitudes are close to the observations, but arrival
time is delayed compared to the observations, indicating the model needs some refinement at these
locations towards the arrival times. The electronic supplementary material, table S7, presents statistical
metrics assessing the performance of a tsunami model at various stations, as shown in figure 18. The R
and SS5% the model's reliability, with many stations achieving 100%, highlighting statistical significance
between observed and modelled wave heights. From electronic supplementary material, table S7, the
NRMSD and NMAD values show that the average discrepancies between observed and simulated
values are lower, denoting better simulations. For many stations, the higher NNSE values indicate
a better predictive performance of the model. Overall, the model demonstrates good performance at
several stations, highlighting the model’s capability to capture tsunamis.
6. Conclusion
ADCIRC’s ability to solve SWE efficiently stems from its message passing interface-based parallel
processing capabilities and its FE approach. This enables swift simulations, critical for operational
tsunami warning centres (TWC) to quickly disseminate vital information to emergency responders,
authorities and the public, facilitating timely evacuations and reducing potential casualties. ADCIRC’s
real-time tsunami simulation capability, simulating tsunami propagation across global or regional
scales within minutes, is invaluable for providing timely forecasts of coastal impacts.
