and water compressibility can slightly delay wave propagation, explaining why arrival times are
sometimes predicted earlier than observed.

(4) Exclusion of aftershocks and secondary waves: The current set-up does not incorporate aftershocks,
which can generate additional waves following the main event. In several historical tsunamis,
aftershocks contributed significantly to secondary wave heights, particularly in the near-field
region. This omission could explain some underestimations of wave heights in certain locations,
particularly after the initial wave.

(5) Local coastal morphological features: Coastal morphology, such as the presence of bays, inlets and
steep topography, can significantly influence wave amplification. While ADCIRC’s mesh resolves
coastal features, there may still be some unresolved finer-scale morphological effects due to
mesh resolution constraints that lead to discrepancies between predicted and observed wave
heights. In regions with complex coastal geometries, these effects could cause the model to either
overestimate or underestimate wave heights depending on local amplification factors.

The observed discrepancies are likely due to a combination of uncertainties in seismic source data,
limitations of the bathymetric resolution, simplifications in the SWE and the exclusion of aftershocks
and certain local morphological effects.
