Regarding computational requirements, ADCIRC benefits greatly from HPC environments, where
real-time applications typically use several hundred to a few thousand processing cores, depending
on the scale and resolution needed. However, dependency on HPC infrastructure can pose challenges,
especially for TWC in resource-limited regions. While ADCIRC excels in simulating deep water wave
propagation, its computational demands increase in nearshore areas where higher resolution is needed
to capture finer coastal details. Mesh refinement, essential for accurately modelling coastal impacts,
can significantly increase computational time, particularly when very high resolution is required. To
mitigate this, operational centres can apply finer mesh resolution only in critical coastal areas or
regions of interest while maintaining coarser resolution in deeper waters. Additionally, pre-running
scenarios for frequently occurring seismic sources can reduce real-time computational demands by
allowing simulations to start from pre-calculated initial conditions, further enhancing operational
efficiency. The accuracy of wave heights and arrival times largely depends on bathymetry and
real-time estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude, geographic extent and the slip on the fault. Using
