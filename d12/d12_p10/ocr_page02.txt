Accurately predicting the arrival time of tsunamis and wave height at coastlines and inunda- : &
ted areas is critical for effective evacuation and mitigation efforts. Various advanced mathematical ~
models are used to model and predict tsunami wave dynamics. The shallow water equations (SWE) yg
obtained by integrating Navier-Stokes equations along the depth, assuming vertical acceleration is : &
small compared to horizontal acceleration, capture the tsunami behaviour [5]. Depending on the .
availability of high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, various numerical methods are applied to
solve these SWEs and simulate tsunamis. Numerical methods like finite difference (FD) [6-10], finite
volume (FV) [11-14] and finite element (FE)( [15,16] and smoothed particle hydrodynamics [17-20])
are employed for simulating tsunamis. These numerical models need the initial sea level disturbance
due to seabed displacement caused by the earthquake thrust. The fault parameters needed to calculate
initial displacement are longitude, latitude, depth of the earthquake, length, width, strike angle, dip
angle, rake angle and fault slip. Once these parameters are known, the Okada solution [21] can
calculate the initial displacement or deformation. Tsunamis in real time are also forecasted based on
the pre-computed scenario database. A pre-run scenario database results from numerous tsunami
simulations for various potential earthquake scenarios or a model simulation result calculated with
the initial seismic deformation condition against the pre-defined input fault geometry [22,23] across
a specific region. These simulations pre-calculate and save tsunami wave travel times and run up for
different earthquake magnitudes, locations and fault mechanisms. In real time, when a tsunamigenic
earthquake occurs, the closest focal combination is picked and scaled to match the actual scale.
2. The objective of the study
ITEWS issues warnings based on pre-run database scenarios [3,4]. As a redundant option, ITEWS
explored running a numerical model in real-time [24] based on the available HPC facilities once
fault parameters are estimated. ITEWS INCOIS has demonstrated the capabilities of the ADvanced
CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model, an SWE solver to compute tsunami wave heights, wave arrival times
and inland inundation once the seismic fault parameters are known by launching the model in
real-time [24]. ADCIRC is a fully parallel continuous Galerkin Finite Element based shallow water
model that computes the water level and currents at different scales on an unstructured grid [25]. The
model was set up for the Indian Ocean, which covers the potential tsunami threat from the Sumatra
and Makran subduction zones. The current work aims to extend the ADCIRC model to set up for
the distant global tsunamis. Distant tsunamis, also called teletsunamis, are a series of giant waves
generated by large-magnitude earthquakes that travel thousands of kilometres and reach the global
coasts, creating significant damage [26]. Teletsunamis can travel across different ocean basins for hours
before their arrival, and local factors like coastal geography and underwater features can amplify the
tsunami waves in specific areas, increasing their destructive power. Because of their long-distance
travel, these global tsunamis give sufficient time for issuing warnings and evacuations. In our present
study, we have utilized ADCIRC to simulate distant global tsunami propagation and its characteristics
at various coastal regions over the globe. We have simulated a few significant historic global tsunamis
and exhaustively compared the results with many observations to validate the current set-up. This
