FIG. 5. (a)-(b) Maximum wave amplitude A, given by Eq. (5), as a function of the water depth hg, for (a) different initial
height Hp with the same aspect ratio a = 3, and (b) different a with Hyp = 40 cm. (c¢)-(d) Amn /ho as a function of (c¢) Fro as

sublinear shape. Note that the influence of the aspect ratio on the relative wave amplitude is almost imperceptible
when varying the rescaled volume of the immersed deposit in figure[5{d), but is non-negligible when the global Froude
number is varied, as in figure [5[c).
Comparison with the experiments. In figure[6[a), the prediction of the wave amplitude A,, using Eq. is
compared to the experiments from figure[2] The numerical prefactors found by the best fit for each initial geometry
are in the range [0.42-0.49], i.e., very close to the value 0.45 of Eq. (5). A good agreement is observed in shallow water
conditions, as the bell-shaped curves are correctly reproduced. As expected, the present model fails in predicting the
plateau values observed for deep water waves (A,, < 0.45 hg) since the model is not valid under these conditions. The
relative wave amplitude A,, /hg is also reported as a function of Frq in figure[6]b), alongside the model curves obtained
for identical initial granular columns. All experimental data are within the collection of model curves from Eq. (6),
with a sublinear increase of A,,/hg with Fry for a given a. The influence of the aspect ratio is also well captured in
the investigated range, as shown by the experiments (¥) with the most slender initial columns, that are significantly
below the other data (corresponding to lower values of a). Therefore, at first order, the global Froude number Fr
governs the relative wave amplitude, but with a noticeable effect of the initial aspect ratio. It is also interesting to
consider the correlation between the relative wave amplitude and the relative volume of immersed deposit. To do
so, we first compare the model prediction for the volume of the immersed deposit AV ¢1, with the experimental
measurements of AV... Figure [6[c) shows that there is a good correlation between them. A linear trend of slope
0.65 fits well the data, showing that the predicted volume overestimates the measurements in a systematic way, here
again because the final immersed deposit is not perfectly trapezoidal. Using this result, it is possible to compare
Ap /ho to AV. / (Who?) for all experiments and to draw the corresponding model curves, as shown in figure [6[(d).
The agreement between the experiments and the predictions allows one to explain the strong link existing between
AV, /(Who?) and the generated wave, which was previously reported 43]. This correlation is a striking result, that
may appear surprising, but one needs to keep in mind that the final deposit is the result of the gravity-driven collapse
and is thus reminiscent of its dynamics. The empirical equation for the wave amplitude given in 43] is also reported
