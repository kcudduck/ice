from 43]. The colored solid lines in (a), (b), and (d) correspond to the model predictions for the same initial granular columns
as in the experiments, and the shaded areas are the same as in figure[2]
in figure[6ld), to highlight that the present model better captures the experimental data in the whole range of shallow
water conditions.
Conclusion. The amplitude A,,, of the impulse wave generated by the collapse of a granular column in a shallow water
of depth hg can be predicted by combining the spreading dynamics of the grains 36], relating the initial parameters
of the column to the local Froude number Fr¢ based on the advancing granular front at the water surface, and the
wave hydrodynamics linking Fry to A,, 44]. In this situation, the spreading motion of the grains indeed behaves as
a peculiar piston, whose velocity is coupled with its stroke. The present model explicits the evolution of A4,, as a
function of the initial parameters Hy, Lg, and hg. In addition, it highlights the important role played by the global
Froude number Fro = +/Hy/hg and the relative volume AV, /(W hg?) of the immersed deposit. It explains why these
different dimensionless numbers have been observed to play a key role in previous studies 40, 42, 43, 45].

It is worth noting that the numerical prefactors obtained in the model slightly depend on the considered granular
matter. Therefore, one would need to adjust their values to apply the present model to other materials. Within these
minor adjustments, this predictive model should work in similar configurations, for instance for the ones explored
experimentally 40, 41] or numerically 45] in previous studies, provided that the shallow water condition is fulfilled.
For deep water conditions, a predictive model remains to be developed. The present model should be adapted
accordingly for the topographies and bathymetries that are specific in the field, by expressing the maximum velocity
of the granular front in the impact region, to derive the relevant Froude number in that case. For post-mortem
analysis in the field based on the measurements of the final immersed deposits, the present model could be used
without significant adjustments. Indeed, there is a trace of the gravity-driven dynamics in the final deposit, as shown
by the good correlation of Eq. (7) with all the data for very different columns with a large range of investigated
aspect ratios. In order to investigate 3D effects that may be important in real cases, in particular in the collapse
of volcanic islands such as the 2018 Krakatau event 7|, the study of waves generated by the collapse of cylindrical
columns instead of rectangular ones would be of great interest. Indeed, the scaling laws for the final deposit are known
