Experimental setup. The two-dimensional experimental setup, sketched in figure[1[a), consists in a 2 m x 0.30 m x
0.15 m reservoir, filled up to a height hy with water 42, 44|. A rectangular dry granular column of initial height
H, and width Lg rests on a solid step of height hg, and is retained by a sliding gate. The following ranges of initial
parameters were investigated: 9 cm < H, < 50 cm, 2.5 cm < Lo < 20 cm, and 2 cm < hg < 25 cm. The total height
Hy = H, + ho from the bottom plane and the aspect ratio a = Hy/Lg of the initial column were thus varied in the
ranges 11 cm < Hy < 59 cm and 1 < a < 21, respectively. This allowed to explore a larger range of initial parameters,
especially for the aspect ratio, than in previous studies 41, 42, 44]. The grains are monodisperse glass beads of mean
diameter d = 5 mm, density p = 2.5 g.cm™° with a dense packing fraction ¢ ~ 0.64. Using the same grains for all
experiments is motivated by a previous study 42], which showed that the maximum amplitude of the generated wave
does not significantly depend on the grains’ size and density, at least for millimeter-scale grains denser than water.
At the beginning of the experiment, the gate is quickly lifted at V = 1 m.s™! to ensure no significant influence of the
release process on the collapse dynamics 36|. The solid step restricts fluid perturbations induced by the withdrawal
of the gate 41|. The grains fall under the effect of gravity into water, leading to the formation of an impulse wave, as
illustrated in figures[I[c)-(d). The video recordings are then processed to extract the maximum amplitude A,, reached
by the wave, and the maximum horizontal velocity v,, = d¢/dt of the advancing granular front at the water surface
z = hg 44]. In addition, the final morphology of the deposit is characterized by measuring the final runout distance
Lo, height H,, volume AV, of immersed grains, and position /,, of the granular front at z = hg, as illustrated in
figure [1{b).
Influence of the initial parameters on the generated wave and final deposit. The evolution of the maximum
wave amplitude A,, with the water depth hg is presented in figure [2] for three initial geometries of the column. For a
given column geometry, A,, first increases with hg at the shallowest depths, then decreases for intermediate depths,
before saturating at a constant asymptotic value. When the initial fluid depth hg is small compared to the column
height H,, the collective motion of the spreading grains is mainly horizontal, and the advancing front is similar to a
piston pushing the water, as illustrated in figures[I[c)-(d) (see also Supplemental Material 48]). This situation leads
to the formation of either transient bore (A,, = 0.96 hg) or solitary (0.45 hg S A, S 0.96 hg) waves 44]. In that
case, the generation mechanism, i.e., the advancing granular front pushing water like a moving piston, is in agreement
