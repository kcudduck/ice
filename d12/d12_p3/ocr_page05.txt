and therefore A,,/hg is also expected to scale as \/Al./hg, due to the aforementioned approximate linear relation
between A,,/ho and Fry. Figure[4{a) presents the rescaled wave amplitude A,,/ho as a function of Al, /hg for (>)
bore and ([ 1) solitary waves. All experimental data corresponding to shallow water waves collapse onto a master curve
of equation A,,/ho ~ 0.54/Al~ /hg. Therefore, in this case the moving granular front acts like a piston pushing the

water, whose velocity would be coupled to its stroke [as highlighted by Eq. (2)].

An estimate of the typical horizontal extension Af ¢n can be obtained by assuming a triangular shape for the final
deposit: Aly th = AL — hoLoo/ Hs. Using Egs. the final runout distance at z = hg is thus expected to be
given by the relation

In figure [4(b), the measured front position Al. of the final deposit is compared with the prediction of Eq. (3). The
relation Al, = 0.82 Al tn captures all the experiments, with a prefactor revealing a systematic overestimate of
Als, by the model, as the final deposit is not perfectly triangular, but presents some curvature instead 26, 27, 30, 36].
From the two fits of figures|4[a) and [4]b), the wave amplitude should be given by
Ap = 0.45/ Al tn ho. (4)
The prediction given by Eq. fits well the data, as presented in figure [4[c), which reveals that the model captures
the physics behind the wave generation in shallow water. By inserting Eq. in Eq. (4), the wave amplitude can be
expressed as a function of the initial parameters Hy, Lg, and hg to obtain

where the coefficients a, 8, n and m are given in Eqs. (1).

To highlight the influence of the initial parameters on the wave amplitude, figures [5[a)-(b) report the prediction
of A,, given by Eq. (5) as a function of hg for a = 3 and different values of Hy from 20 to 60 cm [figure [5(a)], and
for Hy = 40 cm and different values of a from 1 to 10 [figure [5[b)]. In all cases, we observe that A,, ~ ho'/? for the
shallowest depths, then reaches a maximum value before decreasing. Note that this maximum, as well as the critical
depth at which it occurs, both increase linearly with Hy when a is constant [see Appendix for more details]. The
present model reproduces thus well the bell-shaped part of the curves obtained in figure [2] which were also observed
in previous experimental studies 16, 42].

Let us now explore the prediction of the model for the wave generation as a function of two dimensionless numbers,
reflecting either the initial state or the final deposit of the collapse: the global Froude number Fro = /Hy/hg 40-
42, 45] and the relative volume AV, /(Who?) of the immersed deposit 43]. Using Eq. straightforwardly leads

In addition, within the present model the final immersed deposit would have a trapezoidal shape, of volume AV 11, =

The relative wave amplitude predicted by Eqs. (6) and is presented in figures [5[c) and [5[d), respectively, for
different initial aspect ratios from 1 to 10 and Hy = 40 cm. In both cases, A,,/hg increases monotonically with a
