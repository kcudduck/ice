FIG. 2. Evolution of the maximum wave amplitude A,, with the fluid depth hg, for three different initial granular columns of
same width Lo but different height H,. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the saturation of A,, at large ho. Full symbols
refer to shallow water waves, while empty symbols correspond to deep water waves. The shaded area corresponds to deep water
waves, where A,, < 0.45 ho, and the black dashed line (--) represents the observed limit between bore and solitary waves

with recent numerical simulations which reproduced finely a specific geophysical case with a complex topography 9],
although the initial conditions are quite different than from our model laboratory configuration. On the contrary,
when hg 1s of the order or greater than H,, the grains have essentially a vertical motion, closer to a “granular spillway”
situation, in which a finite volume of grains discharges into deep water (see Supplemental Material 48|). This regime
departs from shallow water conditions and leads to the formation of the so-called nonlinear transition waves for
which A,, < 0.45 hg 44]. Increasing the initial height H, of the column, while keeping the other initial parameters
constant, systematically leads to higher values for the wave amplitude. In the following, the study focuses on shallow
water waves (A,, = 0.45 hg), whose understanding is of significant importance for risk assessments as bore waves are
potentially very destructive in enclosed fjords scenarios 8], while at the same time solitary waves can propagate and
distribute part of the collapse energy far from the source.
In the present configuration, the generated wave is a direct consequence of the granular collapse. Therefore, it is
