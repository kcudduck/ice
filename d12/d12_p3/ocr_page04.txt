interesting to focus also on the main features of the final granular deposit, characterized by its final height H., and
runout distance AL. = Lo, — Lg. In the dry case, these two final parameters, rescaled by the initial width of the
column, H.,/Ly and ALy/Lg, are known to be governed mainly by the initial aspect ratio a of the column, and
slightly influenced by the material and frictional properties of the grains and the substrate 26, 27, 29, 31]. Figures
3[a) and [3[b) show the evolution of H.,/Lo and AL, /Lg, respectively, as a function of a. In the present experiments,
the initial granular column stands on a solid step of height hy, and one may expect that the final deposit may be
different from the one that would occur without a solid step. The initial dataset is thus subdivided into two parts:
(0) the experiments for which the solid step has no significant influence on the final deposit, i.e., where Hy/hg > 4
and hg < Lg according to 49], and (x) those impacted by the presence of the step. For the first set (0), the relative
final height H../Lg [figure[3[a)], and runout distance AL. /Lq [figure [3[b)] are then fitted by piecewise power laws
of the initial aspect ratio, following Lajeunesse et al. (2005) 26]:
H. i a for a < 0.93,
— =a" =
Lo 0.95 a'/3 for a > 0.93,

AL... 1.65 a for a S 3,
— = — Ba™ =
Ly 2.38 a?/3 for a > 3,
where the prefactors a and 3 are slightly dependent on the material and frictional properties (except the trivial value
a = 1 for low enough aspect ratios) 28, 31, 35|, and would also be impacted by the presence of cohesion 14, 50].
Therefore, using different grain or substrate properties would require one to adjust these coeflicients accordingly. The
exponents of Eqs. differ from 2D to 3D configurations 26, 27], and are a signature of the gravity-driven dynamics
of the collapse 30]. It should be mentioned that although no experimental data are available here at low aspect
ratio (a < 0.93), the scaling Ho, /Ly = a is represented, as this case corresponds to the trapezoidal final shape of the
deposit already described by previous work 26, 27, 30, 34, 36|, where only a fraction of the initial granular column
collapses, so that H,, = Hp. The second set (x) of experiments deviates significantly from the scalings of Eqs.
for the final height as well as for the run-out distance. These data are either impacted by the presence of the solid
step or depart from shallow water conditions (deep water waves), and are therefore not considered in the following.
A predictive model for the wave amplitude. To understand the bell-shaped curves for A,, (hg) in shallow water,
as illustrated in figure [2] the local Froude number Fry = v,,/+/ghg needs to be related to the initial parameters of
the granular column as it is known that, at first order, A,,/ho ~ 1.2 Fry 42, 46]. The granular front velocity v,,
is expected to scale as Aly, /7;, where Al, = fo — Lg is the front position of the final deposit and 7, the typical
spreading time of the granular mass, both taken at z = hg. In a recent study, 7, was shown to be proportional to
Vv Als /g 36]. Using this result, Fry may be estimated as
