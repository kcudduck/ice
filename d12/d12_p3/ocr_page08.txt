APPENDIX : CRITICAL DEPTH FOR A MAXIMUM WAVE AMPLITUDE
It 1s interesting here to provide a discussion on the critical water depth at which the maximum wave amplitude is
reached, for the collapse of a granular column of a given aspect ratio, as observed in the bell-shaped curves of Figs.
5(a)-(b). From Eqs (3)-(4), one can obtain that the critical depth is given by hf = AL Hs /(2L), which leads to
the corresponding amplitude A¢ ~ 0.45y/ALo®Ho/(4L+). For a column with a given aspect ratio a, leading to a
given deposit, we can infer from these expressions that both Af and AS increase linearly with the initial height Hj
of the column, as can be observed in Fig. 5(a). To illustrate this point, fom Eqs. we can write hi /Hy in terms of
the initial aspect ratio a of the granular column in the following manner:
0.83a
— for a < 0.93,
1+ 1.65a ~
hg 0.78a'/2
— My — for 0.93 < a < 3, (8)
Hy 1 + 1.65a ~o
1.13
——— for a 2 3.
1 + 2.38a2/3 ~
These expressions thus show that hg is proportional to Hy when the aspect ratio of the column is kept constant.
The associated critical Froude number Fr; = /Hg/h§ is presented in figure [7] as a function of the aspect ratio of
the column. It shows a nontrivial evolution with a, with a sharp decrease for low aspect ratio (a < 0.93), and an
increasing region for higher values of a. It means that, for aspect ratios below 0.93, the maximum value for the
amplitude of the wave is reached for Af small when compared to the initial column height Hy. Around a ~ 0.93, the
curve reaches a global minimum where Fry; ~ 1.8, so that hi ~ Hy/3.24: It is the highest possible value of hf when
varying the initial aspect ratio of the column. Then, increasing a beyond this point again implies that the critical
wave amplitude occurs with hg increasingly small when compared to Hy.
