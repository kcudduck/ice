Loading machine. The basic loading device for all tests was a screw-driven Instron universal
testing machine. model TT-BNM-L. with a capacity of 500 kgl (x5 000 N and head speeds
from 5 10 5 to 5.0 em min. The loading unit was housed in a cold room. with the control
unit and read-out system outside the cold room. Communication between operators inside
and ouside the cold room was by telephone, and there was a frost-free window in the cold-
room wall
For tests at speeds higher than 5 cmomin a special variable-rate loading deviee was built.
I'his was a dashpot-controlled actuator operated by compressed air introduced through a
solenoid valve. Calibration tests gave actuator speed as a function of input pressure and
dashpot setting. The variable rate loading device was bolted to the Instron testing machine
<o that the pulling system and load cells used for low speed work could still be used.
