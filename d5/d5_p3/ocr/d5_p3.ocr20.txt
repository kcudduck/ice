Failure stramn. Failure strain is shown as a function of average strain-rate in Fig. 21, The
<train (o failure decreases with inereasing strain-rate for both tension and compression. but the
yates of change differ for tension and compression. The failure strain in compression is
roughly an order of magnitude greater than the failure strain in tension.

Testing technigue. The technique used for uniaxial tensile testing is believed to be basically
<atisfactory for tests in the elastic brittle realm of hehaviour. where precise methods and fine
tolerances are essential. For tests on anisotropic ice it would, of course, be necessary to modify
the specimen-molding technique. and for work on coarse-grained ice much larger specimens
would he required. A “stiffer”™ loading system might be desirable. and it would certainly be
desivable 1o impose better temperature control by having the test specimen inside a small
chamber

Most of the uniaxial test methods deseribed in the ice literature seem 1o be deficient in
some respeet. The direct butt=joint used by Jellinek (Fig. 22a) is. in principle. the hestarrange-
ment but it is difficult to ensure that a simple ice-metal bond will not break before the body
of the specimen does when temperatures are above about 1o (. The alternative of hbonding
a simple evlinder into a cup or collar (Fig. 22¢) is unsatisfactory for tests to failure. as stress
concentrations are introduced at the junction of specimen and collar, and the specimen tends
10 break at the collar. Specimens which have enlarged end sections and short-radius fillets

Fig. 22b. d. ¢ have significant stress concentrations near the fillet, and if they are prepared
and pulled with precision (mo bending stresses ) they will usually break at the fillet.

The difficulty of making direct uniaxial tensile tests on ice is evidenced by the popularity
of indirect tests, chiefly diametral compression and beam bending tests. However. these
indirect tests are no substitute for the uniaxial test for the following reasons:

a Ttis usually necessary to compute the peak stresses that are assumed to cause failure
from linear clastic theory. with equal moduli for tension and compression.

b It is usually necessary o assume that failure is determined by the greatest principal
stress. and is unaflected by the values of the other two principal stresses.

¢ The pereentage volume of the total specimen which is subjected to the peak tensile
stresses is often very small, and in many cases is only of the order of the grain or flaw
size

dThere are often steep stress gradients in the failure zone.

Of the indirect tensile tests in present use. the beam bending test is perhaps the one most
widely used. However, it has been recognized for many vears that the heam bending test
does not measure uniaxial tensile strength: the value caleulated as the stress in the Tower
fibres of the beam is termed the “modulus of rupture”™. which for most materials substantially
exceeds the uniaxial tensile strength. A\ detailed study of diametral compression testing  Nellor
and Hawkes. 197 1) hasshown that. provided certain experimental conditions are met. the Brazil
test diametral compression of a solid disc ) gives an acceptable measure of the uniaxial tensile
strength for typical rocks. For ice. however, it gives a strength value far lower than the
uniaxial tensile strength. The reasons for this anomaly are not yet clear. although the Tow
ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength for ice may well be involved. The same
diametral compression study brought out serious deficiencies in the ving tensile test. and led o
a conclusion that any correspondence between ring tensile strength and uniaxial tensile
<rength is largely coincidental. However, the ring test may give an approximation to the
modulus of rupture when the ratio of internal to external diameter for the specimen is sufli-
ciently large.
