Avercge Strain—Rate , 57!
Fie. 18, Miitial tangent modulus as a_function of average strain-rate.

In Figure 1g the results for simple eylinders are omitted. as it is believed that they ar
invalid. In spite of the precautions taken, simple eylinders failed by axial cleavage ratha
than by complete cataclasis.

Compressive strength is given as a function of time o failure in Fig. 20, which brings
out the high sensitivity of measured strength to loading rate for test durations less than
approximately too s at 7 C. It also shows that measured strength s relatively insensitive
to changes in loading rate for test durations exceeding about 1o min. Apparent strength for
tests lasting half-an-hour or so is only about 359, of the apparent strength for vapid tests that
take only a few scconds.

In tests where strain-rate was increased by a factor of 1o after “failure™. a new peak stress
higher than that reached in yielding at the inital strain-rate was avained (Fig. 110 The peak
stress for a “failed™ specimen was 80 10 g0 ol the peak stress for an intact specimen tested
at the same strain-rate.
