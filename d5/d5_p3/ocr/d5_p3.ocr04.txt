that there are no significant stress concentrations, .. there is a gradual change of stress in the
transition from the central neck o the flared end sections. with no stress discontinuity.

Dimensions of the dumbbell specimen relative o the grain size of the material are such
that surface effects are minimized and volume effects are slight. The number of grains in the
necked test section is of order 5 - 104, and the minimum lincar dimension of the specimen
the diameter) is about 36 times the grain size of theice. The relevant theoretical considerations

NMolded dumbbell specimens were trimmed 1o Tength on a band saw, using a special
holder to ensure that length was uniform and ends were square. They were then tacked 1o
aluminum end cups by freezing a few drops of water between the specimen end and the base
of the cup. using a special assembly jig (1ig. ) to ensure that the axes of specimen and cups
were coincident. After tacking. alignment was checked by spinning cach specimen in a

The acceptable specimens were finally bonded firmly 1o their cups by freezing water in the
amnmular space between cup wall and specimen. This annular space was kept as narrow as
possible 10 avoid problems from freezing strains. Prior to assembly. the cups were treated
with a mixture of chromic and sulphuric acids to remove all races of grease and to form an
oxidized skin to which the ice would bond. Without this treatment there was a possibility of
bond release and cup slip during the course of a test.

ends were faced-oft in a lathe, and they were frozen onto aluminum end caps. using a tubula
specimen holder to ensure that ends remained square. .\ narrow s fillec of iee was
formed around the contact between specimen and end cap by applying water with a hypo-
dermic syringe.

* Eccentricity is one-half of the maximum dial gage variation on the comparator.
