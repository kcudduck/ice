DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF 1CI g

Values of inital tangent modulus given by compressive tests on simple cvlinders were
significantly lower than those given by tests on dumbbell specimens. and they were rejected
in the belief that errors had been caused by imperfections in the platen contact ice fillets
were observed to crack). Values obtained in compression for the dumbbell specimens showed
appreciable scatters and there was no significant corvelation with strain-rate Figo 18 0 T

U niaxial compressive strength. Uniaxial compressive strength showed strong dependence on
loading rate, increasing by almost a factor of 5 as axial strain-rate increased from 1o 5 1o 1o -
