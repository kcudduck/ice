DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF ICI 12
I'he uniaxial compressive tests suggest that, for ice valid tests on simple evlindrical
specimens are very difficult to achieve. Tn the present work considerable care was exercised
i specimen preparation and testing, but axial cleavage occurred and measured swength was
lower than the strength measured on dumbbell specimens. In previous work, and in work
done by others. axial cleavage has been a common mode of failure. and reported values foy
