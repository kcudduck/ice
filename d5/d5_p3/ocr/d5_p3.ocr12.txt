Deformation and fracture. 'T'he dumbbell specimens tested in tension gave no visible evidence
of internal cracking prior to final fracture and separation. However, it should be noted that
the pulling system was relatively “soft™. so that there may have been significant displacement
resulting from release of elastic strain energy as the specimen failed. Almost all of the speci-
mens failed in the necked gage length, usually near the mid-section. Results from the few
specimens that broke near the end caps were rejected. During pilot tests there were occasional
instances of “cup=slip™ caused by partial release of the hond between ice and end cup. but this
problem was solved by introduction of the acid treatment deseribed previously.
