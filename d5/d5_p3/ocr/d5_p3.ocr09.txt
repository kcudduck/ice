DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF ICE 1

Since axial deformation was measured over the entire length of a dumbbell specimen. it
was necessary to determine an effective gage length in order 1o obtain strains from displace-
ments. Making certain simplifying assumptions. and representing the dumbbell shape by a
simple geometry, elastic calenlations gave the axial strain in the neck of the specimen as
0.3 AL owhere AL s the axial deformation measured between the end caps, ice. the caleulated
cffective gage length for the specimen shown in Fig. 2 was 8.0 mm 3,33 inch). To check
this siniple caleulation experimentally. tests were made on two specimens of” cpoxy resin.
one of them a simple right circular evlinder and the other a model of the ice dumbbell speci-
men. Results of these tests gave axial strain in the neck of the dumbbell specimen as 0.2 1A/
I'he caleulated value 0.3 AL was accepted for reduction of test data for ice

Nominal machine speed does not give a reliable indication of strain-rate in the specimen,
since specimen connectors are clastic and machine speed tends to vary somewhat under load.
I'he V1 =plotter provided time marks on load-deformation curves. and “time-to-failure™ was
measured by a stop watch. The strain-rates tabulated for presentation of results were the
average strain-rates {rom zero stress to peak stress failure strain divided by time o failure
and the strain-rate at peak stress (usually equal to machine speed divided by gage length .
I'he average stress rate (peak stress divided by time o failure ) was also tabulated.

Load was measured by two independent systems. The clectrical vesistance strain-gage
load cell of the basic testing machine was used, and a separate load cell was fitted o the
machine for use in conjunction with the LVID'T strain gages, so as 1o obtain a continuous plot
of load against displacement on the X1 plotter  Fig. 8 . The swip chart recorder of the
Instron testing machine was used throughout to keep a back-up record of load as a function
of cross-head displacement.

For high speed tests the output from the independent load cell was fed to an oscilloscope.
and load time curves were recorded from the oscilloscope sereen by a Polaroid camera
I'he oscilloscope gave stress rate and time 1o failure, but strain-rates had o be estimated
indirectly. Strain-rate at peak stress was taken as actuator speed divided by gage Tength.
and average strain-rate was estimated from a graphical correlation of average strain-rate with
average stress rate, using data from all tests.
