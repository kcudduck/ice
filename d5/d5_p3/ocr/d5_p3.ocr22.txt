Butkovich (1954 . cannot be recommended.

Dumbbell specimens apparently overcome the end effect problems that can so casily
vitiate compression tests. but they are more diflicult 1o prepare than eylinders

Since uniaxial compressive strength is a strong function of strain-rate for the range repre-
sented by typical speeds ol commercial testing machines, at least at high temperatures,
selection of suitable strain-rates or loading rates can be a problem. In engineering studies the
test loading rate may be decided by the nature of the practical problem involved. but i mon
general studies it is not casy to decide upon any single strain-rate. since there i inter-relation-
ship between the effects of strain-rate and temperature which might confuse results The
present limited data suggest that uniaxial compression tests intended 1o induce clastic strain
and brittle fracture ought to be run at strain-rates no less than 1o 2 s at peak stresscor o880
average rate, when temperatures approach the melting point. Interms of stress rate, this is
equivalent 1o about 30 to 50 bar/s. which is a great deal higher than the minimum rate of
0.5 bar s recommended by Butkovich (1958 and followed by others. and the minimum rate
of 1o bar s suggested by Gold (1968 Ihe present resulis CFable T Figs. oo show that at

7 C there is inclastic straining and ductile failure at stress rates of order 1 bar s, and
measured compressive strength is strongly sensitive to loading rate.

Initial tangent modulus. The mean value of initial tangent modulus measured in compression
was 8,76 - 104 bar, which is similar to values obtained by dynamic methods using flexural
vibration or elastic wave propagation at sonic frequencies. For bubbly ice at temperatures
between 5 and 10 (. dynamic methods give values of Young's modulus from about
8 10t 10 g 1ot bar (Nakava. 1959: Bentley and others. 1g57: Crary and others. 1g62:
Robin. 1958: Gold. 1958: Gold, 1968 . Most reported values for “static” Young's modulus
in compression are lower than the dynamic modulus. particularly those resulting from: carly
work. when creep effects were not fully appreciated (see. for example. Mantiso rg51. How-
cver, it has been found that the static modulus becomes approximately equal to the dynaimic
modulus ‘and 1o the modulus for a single crystal ) if temperature is low enough or strain-rate
high enough (Gold. 1958, 1968 .

Initial tangent modulus measured in tension inereased with inercasing strain-rate. but all
values were close 10 6 10! bar. These values are similar to some of the more acceptable
reported values for compression (e.g. Gold. 1958 and flexural tension (Yakunin. 1968 . but
well helow the dynamic modulus. presumably because strain-rates were not sufliciently high

Many of the low values of static moduli reported in the literatre (= 104 har undoubtedly
represent secant moduli for slow tests, ies average slopes for non-lincar stress strain curves
Data from the present tests give abundant evidence ol decrease of secant modulus with
decreasing strain-rate or inercasing test duration (see ratio of peak stress o failure swain.

Compressive strength. Over the range of strain-rates comimonly cmployed i uniaxial testing
compressive strength is strongly dependent on strain-rate and temperature, so that there is no
unique value for strength. Neither is there a unique ratio of compressive strength to tensile
strength, since tensile strength is relatively insensitive to changes of strain-rate and temperature

At the highest strain-rates used in these tests (1025 1 compressive strength appeared
10 be tending 1o a limiting value of approximately 85 to go barat 7 €. It has been sug-
gested, from sketehy experimental evidence - Khomichevskaya. 1g4o: Butkovich. 1954, 1958:

that strength actually decreases hefore settling 1o a steady value when aeritical strain-rate is
exceeded. and in the carly stages of this work the preliminary results appeared to support this
contention. However. it was later found that the apparent drop in compressive strength at
high loading rate was actually a consequence of imperfect testing technique the apparent
drop i strength disappeared when specimens were prepared and tested with greater care
