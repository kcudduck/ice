Transition from ductile yvield to brittle fracture. Since there are practical lower limits of strain-
rate for constant rate tests. it would be helpful il creep tests could be interpreted so as to give
“srength™ data for the ductile regime. There appears to be at least implicit recognition of a
relation between the results of constant stress creep tests and constant strain-rate strength
tests for ductile materials, with the relaxation of stress after vielding in a constant strain-rate
test being identified with tertiary creep in the classical creep test (e.g. Higashic 19672 Dillon
and Andersland. 1967, Halbrook (reported by Gold. 1968, observed that the yield stram
in constant strain-rate tests on ice was approximately the same as the strain for onset of tertiary
creep inconstant stress tests. Forcomplete consistency. however, it might be better o
associate the peak yield stress of the constant rate test with the mid-point of secondary creep in
the constant stress test, regarding the latter as a point of inflection.

In view of the probable relationship between the two tests. it seems legitimate 1o use data
from both types of test to examine the limiting stress strain-rate relationship for a wide range
of strain-rates, and to provide some information on the ductile brittle transition. In Fig. 19
and 23 tensile and compressive strengths from the present tests have been plotted as functions
of strain-rate. and the plot has heen extended to lower ranges of strain-rate by plotting stress
against minimum (sccondary creep ) strain-rate for previous creep tests onice of the same type
Thus the graphs show the maximum value of the stress strain-rate ratio for cach type of test.
Itis assumed that the compressive ereep data represent both compressive and tensile behaviour:
Steinemann (1958 found no significant difference between creep rates in compression and
tension. and there is no theoretical expectation of a significant difference il straining is con-
trolled by the octahedral shear stress. ™ Data points for compressive creep were taken from
Mellor and Smith (1967 and Mellor and Testa (1g6gfal. [b] . making small temperature
adjustments where necessary

From the log log plot of Fig. 25 itis seen that there is a smooth transition from the creep
data 1o the strength data, which tends to support the case for the proposed relationship
hetween constant stress and constant rate tests. The combined compression data define a
