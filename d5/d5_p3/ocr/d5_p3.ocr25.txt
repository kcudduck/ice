smooth curve over more than g orders of magnitude: there are no distinet linear sections and
abrupt transitions. such as are sometimes scen in discussion of “power-law™ creep. nor s there
much indication of a drop in strength attributable to onset of brittle fracture. In tension, an
upper limit of stress was reached at a strain-rate of order 1o+ s ' although the stress strain
diagrams continued 1o show noticeable curvature up to about 10 5 1. In compression. it
appears that an upper it of stress is being reached at a strain-rate of 1o 2« and at this
strain-rate the stress strain diagrams cease (o show noticeable curvature, The curves for
tension and compression bilurcate at 1o 05 1
