DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF ICE 100

Tensile pulling system.Tensile specimens were attached to the testing machine by two
lengths of 159 mm diameter standed sceel cables which were fitted with suitable connectors

Fig. 6 . Originally. cach cable was approximately 75 mm long. but since this gave a very
“soft”™ loading system. shorter cables, approximately 25 mm long. were fitted for the Tatter
stages of the work.

I'he connector cables were made up from .59 mm L inch s diameter. 7-wire, 7-strand.

of the wires in the strands is opposite o the Tay of the strands in-the cable so as 1o minimiz
nwisting under load. T'o determine the effect of cable twist, weights were hung on a connecto
cable and the torque needed to prevent rotation was measured as 0.7 Ibfinch 0071 N'm
for a load of 200 Ibf (890 N . This permits an estimate of the tensile stress o induced in the

where 7 is the applied torque and D is specimen diameter. Thus the tensile stress induced
by cable twist is only about 19, of the axial tensile stress, and for present purposes it can be
ignored.

When flexible cables are used to pull the specimen, the only bending stresses are those
induced by eccentric loading.  General analysis of this problem is complicated. but the
magnitude of the effect can be estimated by assuming that the line of action of the load is
parallel to the specimen axis but offset by a distance Ao With this assumption the distribution
of axial stress in the bending plane is:

o PR g A R
where o is the axial stress, 22 is applied load. 7 is distance from the neatral axis. R is specimen
radius, and A is eccentricity. Maximum tensile stress at the outer radius. R. thus exceeds
the mean tensile stress by 42N =R+ ). so that the maximum ervor introduced by eccentric
loading is (800N D0 With maximum allowable cecentricity of 0.1 mm for a specimen
25,4 mm in diameter, this amounts 1o a maximum potential crror of 30

I'o check the uniformity of stress in test specimens, tests were made on a model dumbbell
specimen made from epoxy resin. The epoxy specimen was bonded into a pair of end cups
with cold-setting cpoxy cement. and was found to have an cecentricity of o.oor inch to.oz5mm
alter asserbly. Three electrical resistance strain gages were bonded o the center section of
the specimen so as (o give axial strain at three points of the perimeter spaced 120 apart
Ihey were coupled separately to the X-input of an X1 plotter, with an axial load cell coupled
1o the T-input. The outputs of all three strain gages were identical. they were linear with
load. and there was no hysterisis between loading and unloading. This indicated that the
loading system gave reasonably uniform distribution of axial stress inthe specimen with an
alignment wlerance of o025 mm.

During initial evaluation of the systeni tests were made on specimens which had a range
of cecentricities. Figure 7 shows a correlation between cecentricity and measured tensile
sorength. with the cutof finally chosen as the tolerance for cecentricity.

Compressive loading system. Vor loading dumbbell specimens in compresion. a thick
aluminum cap with a central hole was ficted over cach of the aluminum cups of the specimen.
producing flat surfaces 1o which load could be applicd from the platens of the testing machine
The specimen thus capped was centered on the Tower platen of the testing machine. and load
was applicd from the upper platen through a steel ball. While this system was expedient it is
less than ideal: a suitably designed independent spherical scat would have been preferable
