Cniaxial tensile strength. Uniaxial tensile strength showed remarkably licde dependence
on loading rate g, 1g). The variation in strength was only about 257 as strain-rate varied
through more than 5 orders of magnitude. For the range of strain-rates from 10 410 10 25 1
tensile strength at 7 Coremained approximately constant at a mean value of 214 har
sro Ibfineh? . There was a slow decrcase in strength as strain-rate increased or decreased
from this range.
