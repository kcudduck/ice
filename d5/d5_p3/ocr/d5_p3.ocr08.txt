Simiple cylindrical specimens were loaded through a steel ball in a similar manner and
the same criticism applies.

Strain and load measurements. "T'he basic testing machine was cquipped to record cross-head
displacement automatically, but in general cross-head displacement exceeds displacement in
the test specimen, especially when thin cables are used for tensile tests.

Ideally. strain gages should be attached directly to the test specimen so as to measure strain
in the mid-section and thus avoid confusing “end-cflects™. However, this proved diflicult

Axial deformation was measured by a matched pair of lincar variable differential transforme
transducers (LVDT's . which were supported by frames clamped to the specimen end caps

transformers and the core rods. so that there is no restraint and no damage when the specimen

The LVIYT's were calibrated by attaching them o a eylindrical aluminum specimen of
known modulus and applying load through a calibrated load cell. The aluminum test
eylinder was also fitted with clectrical resistance foil strain gages 1o provide a check on the
book value of Young’s modulus.  An independent calibration was made by linking the
LVDTs in parallel with a proving ring and dial gage and loading the system through an
clectrical strain-gage load cell. These calibration tests showed that the gage outputs were
linear with displacement and free from hysteresis effects. The output was independent of
longitudinal or lateral positioning of the core rod in the transformer. The gage sensitivity
which actually can be altered by adjustment of the carrier amplifier) was 1.47 inch mV’

37.35 mm mV . Output from the LVDT'S was recorded continuously on an '} plotter
