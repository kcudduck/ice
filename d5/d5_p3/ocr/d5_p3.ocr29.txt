APPENDIN
Frreer or HIE DOPING ON TENSILE STRENGTH OF POLYCRYSTALLINE 1CL

\ few tests were made onice doped with hyvdrogen fluoride. Standard dumbbell specimens were treated with
dilute hydrofluoric acid immediately after molding, and the hvdrogen fluoride was allowed o diffuse through the
ice for about 3 months before testing. Estimated average concentration of HE i the e was 10 popamn. Tensile
tests were made in the usual way, but sinee the LN strain gage system was not available for these tests the
output of the external load cell was recorded as o function of time onan oscilloscope. Both the oscilloscope record
and the Tnstron chart record gave stress as o function of cross-head displacement, but strains calculated from
cross-head displacement for control specimens proved 1o be greatly in excess of the strains measured by the LADT
astenn. Phus no reliable stress strain curves were obtained.

Phe tests were madeat 7 G Coowith aomachine speed of 0.5 conmin (8.33 10 2 mm's). For ordinary
e specimens this machine speed gave an average steain-vate of 2,28 = 10 55 £ but for T specimens the average
crainerate would be lower than this. The results of four good tests on doped specimens gave tensile strength
vanging (rom .10 1o g.g3 bar, with a mean value of g.62 bar. The tensile sirength of a control samiple of untreated
ice tested at the same time was 22,4 bar, and the mean tensile strength ol ordinary ice tested carlier under the
same conditions was 20.6 har.

Tt has previously been shown ¢ Jones, 19671 Jones and Glen, 1960 that small aimounts of HIT in single crystals
ofice at 70 Cand 20 C produce a diamatic lowering of deformation resistance and vield strength. The
softening effect of HE apparently becomes less pronounced as temperature inereases. An’ explanation of the
effect has been given by Glen (1968
