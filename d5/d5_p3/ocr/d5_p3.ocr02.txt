2. The ice should he homogencous and sotropic. This implies that the constituent crystals

must have random orientation.

;. The grain size should be small enough to permit determination of bulk properties from

small test specimens, In praciice, this means a grain size not exceeding about 1 mm

I'he present studies evolved from carlier work on polar glacier ice. and so the type of ice
used was similar o that formed by sintering and visco-plastic compaction of snow grains
under dry” sub-freezing ) conditions, e it is porous, or “hubbly”lices A few specimens
were doped with hydrogen fluovide to test the effect of that impurity.

The general procedure for preparing isotropic polyerystalline ice was o pack cquant ice
grains into molds. saturate the vesulting compact with water, and freeze. The ice grains of the
initial compact provided randomly oricnted freezing nuclei and Timited the amounnt of water
which had 1o be frozen in the mold thus reducing the problem of freezing strains

lee grains for the compact were produced from clean snow. Snow was removed from
storage at 35 Chin the form of hard sintered blocks, and these were disaggregated by rubbing
snow on snow. Disaggregated snow was allowed to fall into a nest of vibrating sieves, and
after 5 min of vibration the fraction passing a number 20 sieve but retained on a number 4o
sieve was collected for ice-making purposes. Disaggregation and sieving was carried out at an
ambient temperature not exceeding 20 Cso as to avoid adhesion or sintering of the grains.

Cylindrical specimens were made in “Lucite™ Cpolymethyl-methacrylate) mold blocks,
which were split along the center-line o allow casy removal of finished specimens. “Dumb-
bell™ specimens were made by fitting special = Lucite” inserts into the eylindrical molds. The
mold block was prepared by greasing the main joints and gaskets with = Vaseline™ (petwoleunm
jelly . and lightly smearing the mold surfaces with silicone grease. A\ special aluminum jig
was used to position the dumbbell inserts during assembly of the mold block.

The molding operation began with formation of the ice-grain compact. Freshly sieved
grains were slowly added to vibrated molds, and vibration continued until there was no further
settlement of the compact. This took place ata temperature not exceeding 20 € but when
packing was complete the mold block was transferved o a room where temperature was only
a few degrees below the melting point. After adjustment to the higher temperatre, distilled
degassed water® at o Cowas run into the compacts from a water passage in the base ol the
mold block: a vacant mold in the block was used to maintain the necessary head of water.
\s water rose through the compact it displaced most of the air. but enough was left o form
bubbles. Saturated compacts were then left to freeze inan ambient temperature a few degrees
below o C:owith air circulating beneath the mold block and an insulating cover on top of it
freezing progressed along the length of the specimens and freezing strains were minimized.
Specimens were removed by disassembling the mold block. They were packed in polyethylenc
hags for storage. and copious quantities of loose snow were added o the bags (o minimize
cvaporation.

Completely clear ice could not be made by this method, but it is believed that clear ice
might possibly he made by saturating under vacuum at a temperature fractionally below
o (L

The ice used in this study had a bulk density of 0.89g -+ 0.002 Mg me: the average grain
size was approximately 0.7 mm and the average bubble size was approximately o.2 mm (Fig

Test specimens. "The conventional test specimen for uniaxial tests on ice is a simple right
cireular eylinder. In compression testing it is usually pressed between flat platens, and in
tension testing it is [rozen to end caps which can be attached 1o a pulling system. For tests 1o
