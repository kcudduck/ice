Average Strain-Rate , s
Fie. 25. Direct elastic strain as a_function of average stran-rate.
Prukhin 19667 have attempted o explain this behavior by analysis of rheological models.
In the present work, the apparent strength drop for high strain-rates disappeared when the
testing technicue was improved, and the writers are therefore dubious about the reality of this
effect. Similar questions might be raised about some of the effects attributed to ductile brittle
fransition in other branches of materials testing.
