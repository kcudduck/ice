I'he dumbbell specimens tested in compression at low loading rates experienced internal
cracking at stresses well helow the peak stress (Figss g0 110 The first cracks were seen at
strains from 1 - 10 o 0 1o owith no obvious dependence on strain-rate. The cracks wer
planar. with diameter approximately equal 1o the grain diameter of the ice. "They were
oriented with their planes approximately parallel to the loading direction. Each individual
crack lormed abruptly. and showed no tendeney to propagate once it was formed. The fre-
quency of crack formation inercased as the stess inercased. and final structural failure of the
specimen oceurred when crack density in certain zones became suflicient o allow effective
coalescence of the cracks. There were definite preferred zones for internal cracking Fig. 1300
and the final effect was 1o cause disintegration and bursting of the mid-section while relatively
intact conical picces were left at the specimen ends  Figs. 1 and 15 0 This type of failure.

Fig. rg. Dumbbell specimens after failure in compression
termed cataclasis, is typical for granular rocks. and the characteristic conical ends are pro-
duced by radial vestraint at the loading platens. In Fig. 16 the sequence of internal cracking
and final collapse for a compression specimen with laterally vestrained ends s illustrated by
means of a slab model made from coarse-grained “commercial™ ice.
From Figs. . 1o, 11 it appears that the characteristic “knee™ of compressive stress strain
curves may be associated with the onset of internal cracking
Like the dumbbell specimens, eylindrical specimens suffered internal cracking prior 1o
final failure when they were loaded at low rates: first cracks again were seen at strains from
i <10 ¢ to 310 50 However, there was a striking difference in the final mode ol failure
whereas the dumbbell specimens failed by cataclasis and “coning™. the eyvlindrical specimens
failed by axial cleavage Fig. 170 Since relatively large cracks were observed o form at the
platen contacts. there can be livde doubt that these cleavage failures resulted from imper-
fections at the platen contact. For a given strain-rate. ceylindrical specimens failed at lower
stresses than dumbbell specimens "Table |
