DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF 1CE 125

I'he highest observed value for the vatio of compressive strength 1o tensile strength was
approximately porat 1o s Cand 7 G This is smaller than the value of 8 predicted by
simiple Grithich theory for fracture of brittle materials, and considerably smaller than values
found for typical rocks (810 20 . Lavrov (1965 gave a compression tension ratio for colummnan
ice of g but the strength values which give the ratio are not too convineing. A\ low compres-
sion tension ratio for ice has significant bearing on problems involving failure eriteria.

Taking into account the fact that bubbly ice tends 1o be weaker than clearer types of pure
ice. most reported values (NMantis. 1957, Butkovich, 19540 1955, 19500 Kaplar, 1954,
Vovikovskive 1960 Lavrove 1g65: NMellor and Smith, 1966 Peschanskive 19670 Savles and
Epanchin, unpublished  seeni low in comparison with the results obtained here from dumbbell
specimens. Some of these reported low values te.g. Mellor and Smith. 1966 are undoubtedly
crroncous vesults produced by poor testing technique.

Tensile strength. X significant vesult of the tensile tests is the demonstrated insensitivity o
strain-rate over more than 5 orders ofmagnitude. This suggests that tensile strength might also
be msensitive 1o temperature, as indeed it appears 1o be from the limited available data

lished records of tests onvice by L. Hanson of U.S. AL CLRURVELL

Very few direct measurements of uniaxial tensile strength have heen made for ice. and
what values are available seem Tow in comparison with the present resulis. Butkovich 1G5
obtained a strength of about 1 bar for clear® ice at 5 o 10 C.ousing the method illus-
trated in Figs 2voes Kaplar's (19500 resulis. obtained by the method illustrated in Fig. 22
give acan value ol about 13 bar for clearice at 6.5 Cafter rejection of data for specimens
that broke in the end cups. A value of 2,75 bar for cohnnnar ice at some unspecified tempera-
ture was obtained by Lavrov (1965 - who pulled prismatic specimens

Because direct uniaxial tensile tests are diflicult to make, most of the tensile strength data
for ice have been obtained from indircet tests. and as already stated. these can be misleading
Following a detailed study of diametral compression testing. the writers used the Brazil test 1o
measure tensile strength indirectly at 7 CoNlellor and Hawkes. 1971 . obtaining mean

it seems certain that the Brazil testo when applied and interpreted in the accepted manner,
gives strength values foriee that are far lower than the uniaxial tensile strength.

The writers also made ring tests on bubbly ice at 7 C.ovarying the vatio of internal 1o
external diameter from o o 0.25 and varving machine speed from 8.55 10+ 10 8,55 10

both diameter ratio and machine speed. and mean values ranged from 11 10 g4 bar. From
these results. and from a detailed theoretical and experimental study of the ring test for rocks in
general it was concluded that the ring test does not give a valid measure of the tensile strength
ol ice Furthermore. it is doubtful whether it even gives a self-consistent index of tensile
strength. Some reported mean values of ring-tensile strength for ice are: 21 1o 36 bar clear
