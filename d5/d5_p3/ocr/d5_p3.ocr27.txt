DEFORMATION AND FRACGTURE OF [CE 120
Fatlure stramn. "The increase in failure strain with decreasing strain-rate can probably be
attributed to creep effects. In Fig. 25 the pure clastic strain to failure, obtained by dividing
the peak stress by the initial tangent modulus. is plotted against average strain-rate. For
tension the clastic strain to failure shows little variation with strain-rate. For compression,
clastic strain to failure increases with increasing strain-rate. roughly in proportion to the
increase in peak stress with strain-rate.
