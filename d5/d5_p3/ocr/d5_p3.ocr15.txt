DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF 1CH 17
Initial tangent modulus. \When a uniaxial test vields a non-lincar stress strain characteristic,
the slope of the curve at the origin is termed the “inital tangent modulus™ T terms of the
Burgers rheologic model (series combination of Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models 1o could
he regarded as the modulus of the Maxwell spring.
