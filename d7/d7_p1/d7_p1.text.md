    Fig. 3 represents laboratory-based electrical conductivity as a func­
tion of temperature for all mineral phases of the Earth’s mantle: olivine,
orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, garnet, wadsleyite, ringwoodite, for a
pressure of 10 GPa and bridgmanite, ferropericlase and akimotoite, for a
pressure of 30 GPa. Solid lines correspond to samples with 100 ppm
water content whereas lines with symbols represent samples with 500
ppm water content. Note that this modelling goes well beyond the sta­
bility field of each mineral phase. Bridgmanite, ferropericlase and aki­
motoite present larger conductivity than upper mantle minerals in the
whole temperature range. At lower mantle conditions, bridgmanite is
the most conductive mineral phase, reaching a conductivity of about 10
S/m at 2500 K. Variability among the conductivity of the upper mantle
phases decreases with temperature, with two orders of magnitude
around 800 K and less than one order at 2000 K. At temperature lower
than 1000 K, orthopyroxene is the most conductive mineral whereas
garnet displays the lowest conductivity. Among all mineral phases
whose electrical conductivity involves proton conduction, ringwoodite
is the less sensitive to water content. For all minerals, the water content
dependance decreases with temperature, in relation to the decrease of
proton conduction mechanism compared to ionic and small polaron
conductions (see e.g. Yoshino (2010)). Note that the conductivity of
upper mantle phases, i.e. olivine, pyroxenes, garnet, wadsleyite and
ringwoodite depends more largely on temperature than those of lower
mantle phases, i.e. bridgmanite, ferropericlase and akimotoite. For a
given composition, electrical conductivity can therefore be considered
as a more reliable proxy for temperature in the upper mantle than in the
lower mantle.
