        Reports on the sky being brightly illuminated before, during, or after large earthquakes have existed for many
     centuries. Physical processes behind this phenomena, however, has not been fully explained despite large public
     interest in this phenomena. In this report, we present photographic evidence that visible light is emitted from
     faults. We observe luminescence that occurs simultaneously with the brittle faulting, and spatial distribution of
     the luminescence coincides the faulting pattern. This luminescence consists of several colors and is recordable
     with commercial digital cameras. In our experimental setting, it was observed only during fracture of granite,
     and we postulate that piezoelectricity of quartz in granite plays a major role in its occurrence.
     Key words: Earthquake light, rock fracture, faulting.

and blue-violet is usually identified with a brighter lumines-
cence. Brightness of the luminescence is apparently con-
trolled by the texture of the rock specimen. We repeatedly
observe that coarse-grained granites produce brighter lumi-
nescence than fine-grained granites (Fig. 2). For coarse-
grained specimens, we are able to compare texture of the
specimen and the spatial distribution of luminescence. Lo-
cation of bright blue-violet spots are spatially correlated
with quartz grains; they are located adjacent to quartz grains
but not on quartz themselves. Both the occurrence and col-
ors of the luminescence are reproducible with the same type
of rock specimen.
   We postulate that bright illuminated spots are likely nitro-
gen molecules excited by an electric discharge or spark at
faulting. Before the faulting, piezoelectric quartz minerals
in the specimen under stress produces a piezoelectric field,
which is neutralized by associated bound charges (Yoshida
et al., 1997). At the faulting, the direct piezoelectric field
disappears immediately, but bound charges would be slow
to dissolve, which causes an electrostatic discharge, such as               Fig. 4. CIE xy chromaticity diagram showing sRGB color space and
