ern hemisphere shows an extreme value at 8.89 kHz. The three-component perturbations
in the HF band remain below 0.2.
3.7. Analysis of Variation Growth Rate

The analysis of D values in Sections 3.2-3.5 only reflects the absolute changes in
disturbances. To verify conclusions such as the ULF band being the most affected by
magnetic storms, this section will calculate the growth rate of perturbations, or the relative
change, across different frequency bands.

Figure 10 illustrates the perturbation growth rates across the four frequency bands for
the period of magnetic storms in November 2021. In the ULF band, the most significant
relative changes occur at frequencies below 5 Hz, with notable relative changes also
observed around 8 Hz and 13 Hz. The relative changes in the ELF and VLF bands are
considerably weaker compared to those in the ULF band. The high-frequency band exhibits
the smallest relative change, which is not discernible as a color difference in the figure.
Therefore, magnetic storms have the most significant effect on the ULF band and a negligible
impact on the HF band.

Figure 10. (a) Dst, (b) SML, growth rate of ULF D value: (c) ULF, (d) ELF, (e) VLF, (f) HE

In order to quantitatively analyze the disturbance growth rate in the four frequency
bands, we draw the curve of the maximum orbit of the disturbance growth rate (Figure 11).
The figure shows that the disturbance growth rate in the ULF band tends to decrease. It
decays sharply at 0-5 Hz and gradually stabilizes after 5 Hz. In the 0-5 Hz band, the
disturbance growth rate is greater than 20%. Above 5 Hz, the disturbance growth rate
remains around 20% and gradually decreases. Around 8 Hz and 13 Hz, there is a slight
increase in the perturbation growth rate. The disturbance growth rate in the ELF band
remains around 8%. The disturbance growth rate in the VLF band reaches an extreme value
(greater than 10%) near 5 KHz, and then gradually decreases, basically not exceeding 10%.
The disturbance growth rate in the HF band is in the neighborhood of 2%.
