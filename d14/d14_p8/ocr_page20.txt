VLF bands by more than 10%. Within the ULF band, the 0-5 Hz range is particularly
sensitive, featuring an extreme value frequency point at 3.9 &= 1.0 Hz. In contrast, the
HF band (above 18 kHz) remains unaffected by magnetic storms and can be primarily
utilized in the design of future spacecraft and communication equipment.

(2) The effects of magnetic storms exhibit hemispheric asymmetry. The timing and inten-
sity of maximum disturbances differ between the hemispheres. In the ULF/ELF/VLF
band, strong disturbances in the ULF band were observed earlier and with greater
intensity in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere. In addi-
tion, in the ELF and VLF bands, constant perturbations below 6 kHz were present in
the southern hemisphere, but not in the northern hemisphere. Consequently, in both
bands, the strength of the electric field perturbation in the northern hemisphere was
more indicative of the overall magnitude of magnetic storms.

(3) Schumann waves exhibit hemispheric asymmetry. In the southern hemisphere,
8 Hz Schumann waves dominate, while in the northern hemisphere, 13 Hz Schu-
mann waves are more prevalent. Schumann waves are also enhanced during mag-
netic storms.

(4) The frequency band of the equatorial ionospheric electric field anomaly during this
magnetic storm was concentrated in the 0-100 Hz range, while frequencies above
100 Hz were less affected by the high-latitude penetrating electric field.
