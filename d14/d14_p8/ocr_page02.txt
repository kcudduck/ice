The primary data used to study magnetic storms include interplanetary magnetic field
and solar wind data, ionospheric and magnetospheric data, and geomagnetic disturbance
indices. However, interplanetary signature data or geomagnetic disturbance indices do
not identity specific frequencies and bands affected by magnetic storms. It is the use of
electric and magnetic field data that allows for in-depth study of this topic. With advances
in space technology, mankind began to utilize satellites and other space probes to observe
solar activity and magnetic storms. Observation of the Earth's magnetic field from space
began more than 60 years ago. However, continuous monitoring of the geomagnetic field
using low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites did not begin until 1999 [10]. Since the launch of
DEMETER in 2004, the satellite has provided technical support for direct observation of the
ionospheric electric field [11]. In 2018, the CSES-1 satellite was launched and became the
second LEO satellite capable of directly observing changes in the electric field in space in
the F-region of the ionosphere [12].

The use of satellite electric and magnetic field data to study frequencies with significant
perturbations caused by anomalous space phenomena has been partially investigated by
previous researchers. In 2002, Trautner [13] analyzed electric field data in the frequency
range of 10 Hz to 300 Hz during magnetic storms, including the Schumann resonance
frequency, and concluded that the peaks of the perturbation signals were concentrated in
the range of 10 to 200 Hz. Parkhomov [14] observed short bursts of geomagnetic pulsations
in the frequency range of 0.2 to 5 Hz during magnetic storms, with a global maximum at
a frequency of 2.78 Â£ 0.38 Hz. Although a preliminary range of anomalous frequencies
has been identified in the ULF band, the most significant specific frequencies affected by
magnetic storms have not yet been determined.

In the ULF band, the study of Pc waves constitutes a significant aspect of ULF wave
research. As early as 1993, Fraser-Smith [15] conducted electromagnetic monitoring of ULF
waves and found that ELF/VLF waves are much less affected than ULF waves when a
magnetic storm is approaching. It has been demonstrated that the response of ULF waves
during magnetic storms is closely related to geomagnetic activity and solar parameters [16].
ULF wave power is linearly correlated with the absolute value of the SYM-H index during
the main phase of the storm and exponentially correlated with the absolute value of the
SYM-H index during the recovery phase [17]. The intensity of geomagnetic pulsations with
a frequency of 27 mHz during the initial phase of the magnetic storm reaches a maximum
in the morning and night segments at polar and auroral latitudes, respectively. Daytime
Pc wave pulsations are strongest during the main phase of the magnetic storm, not during
the recovery phase as previously thought [18,19]. Different interplanetary sources cause
varying pulsation strengths. The higher latitude position of the Pcb pulsation intensity
maximum in CIR storms suggests larger dimensions of the daytime magnetosphere during
CIR storms compared to CME storms [20].

In the ELF and VLF bands, Tatsuta [21] analyzed two years of nightly data from the
VLF/LF observation network in Japan and found that high latitudes are more affected by
geomagnetic activity compared to mid-latitude and low-mid-latitude paths. During the
strong magnetic storm from 8 to 10 November 2004, intense electromagnetic harmonic
emissions between 500 and 2000 Hz were detected at mid-latitudes. Similar emissions were
also observed on 21-22 January 2005 and on 15 May 2005 during two magnetic storms of
lower intensity [22]. Pinto and Gonzalez [23] suggest that the enhancement of these waves
during geomagnetic storms and substorms is characterized by a peak at 550 Hz and that
their intensity is highly dependent on magnetic activity. Zhima [24,25] found that very
low-frequency waves below 3 kHz were significantly enhanced throughout the magnetic
storm, whereas high-frequency waves above 3 kHz were significantly enhanced in the later
part of the main phase and the earlier part of the recovery phase.

In the study of the HF band, Blagoveshchenskii [26] analyzed the manifestation of the
so-called main ionospheric effect on the propagation properties of ten-meter waves during
geomagnetic storms. Specifically, these parameters increase before the active phase of the
disturbance, decrease during the active phase, and increase again after this phase. Since the
