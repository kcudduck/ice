2.2. Wavelet Coherence (WTC) Analysis

This work uses wavelet coherence (WTC) to analyze the correlation between electric
field power sequences and Dst values at different frequencies. Continuous Wavelet Trans-
form (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are the two types of WT. Because of its
appropriate time and frequency localization, the Morlet wavelet (dimensionless frequency,
wo = 6) is an ideal option for extracting features [28]. The WTC spectrum quantifies the
degree to which two-time series co-vary as functions of time and frequency. The XWT
spectrum exposes large shared power areas and relative phases between two-time series in
time frequency space [29,30]. The XWT of two-time series X(t) and Y(t) is defined as

Wi (5) = Wi (s) Wy" (5) (4)

The CWT coefficients of sequences X(t) and Y(t) at frequency scale s are denoted by
WZ (s), and Wy *(s), respectively, and * denotes the complex conjugate.

The square of the wavelet coherence factor is defined as

S[s—IWXY (s)]|?
R? (s) = Bl C/O) | (5)
S[sTIWE (s)] [sT1W (s)]

S is the smoothing operator and s is the scale. WTC values around 1 indicate a
higher degree of resemblance across time series, whilst coherence values near 0 indicate
no correlation.

This paper focuses on the analysis of the 4 January 2021 magnetic storm by examining
data from two days before and two days after the storm, covering the initial, main, and
recovery phases. After removing background noise through satellite data processing, we
conducted a quantitative analysis of the magnetic storm’s impact on different hemispheres
and frequency bands using D value analysis, variation growth rate analysis, and WTC
analysis. This analysis identified the strong disturbance frequencies and frequency bands
of the magnetic storm, as well as its spatial and temporal characteristics. The technical
route of this paper is shown in Figure 1.
