in the range of 22°S to 65°S (d) is 1.81, corresponding to a frequency point of 4.4 Hz. The
maximum D value in the range of 22°N to 65°N (f) is 2.30, corresponding to a frequency
point of 2.9 Hz. In the different regions, the orbits with large disturbances are generally
two orbits (each with an observation time of about 0.5 h), indicating that the time from
strong disturbance to recovery is about 1 h.

3.3. ELF Band" D Value Analysis

In the ELF band, disturbance is intensified by a change in the full-band D value from
0-1 to 1-2 at the second Dst minimum across the range of 65°S to 65°N. As analyzed in
Section 3.1, there is a constant electric field perturbation in the ELF band in the southern
hemisphere, making it impossible to directly observe the electric field perturbation induced
by magnetic storms in this region. According to Figure 5, there is a disturbance correspond-
ing to the second minimum value of Dst in the range of 65°S to 65°N (c), with a disturbance
strength of approximately 1. However, the D values in the ranges of 22°N to 22°S (e) and
22°N to 65°N (f) are generally less than 1. Therefore, the disturbance of D values in the
range of 65°S to 65°N (c) originates from the range of 22°S to 65°S (d). There is a perturbed
response to magnetic storms in the range of 22°S to 65°S (d) with a perturbation intensity
greater than 1. The maximum D value in the range of 22°5 to 65°S (d) is 3.25 (Table 1), cor-
responding to a frequency point of 2441 Hz. Due to the presence of a constant perturbation,
the value of 3.25 cannot be considered as the magnitude of the perturbation caused by the
magnetic storm. Besides the frequency 2500 Hz, there is also a strong disturbance band
between 300 Hz and 900 Hz. Zhang et al. (2022) used satellite electric field data at 225,
725, 1125, 5000, 7500, and 13,500 Hz in their study of electric field disturbances induced by
magnetic storms. Their results show that the electric field anomalies are most pronounced
at 725 Hz, which agrees with the conclusions of our analysis.

The maximum D value in the range of 22°N to 65°N (f) does not exceed 2, and no
distinct strong perturbation frequency point or band is observed. In the range of 22°S to
22°N (e), there is a strong perturbation band below 300 Hz. Due to the broad range of
the ELF band, specific strong perturbation frequency bands cannot be directly identified.
Consequently, we analyze the frequency range from 0 to 300 Hz by segmenting the ELF
band (Figure 6). It can be observed that electric field disturbances in the range of 22°S to
