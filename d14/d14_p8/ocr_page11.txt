In conclusion, the frequency bands affected by magnetic storms are the ULF, ELF, and
VLF bands. All three bands exhibit more pronounced perturbations at high latitudes, with
only the ULF band showing significant enhancement of electric field perturbations near the
Schumann wave frequency point at middle and low latitudes. Overall, the ULF band shows
a greater response to magnetic storms compared to the ELF and VLF bands. However, the
D value only indicates the absolute increment. To obtain a more accurate assessment, the
growth rate of perturbations across different frequency bands needs to be calculated.

3.6. Comparison of Ex, Ey and Ez

Since the satellite electric field has three components, and the Ex component was
used in the previous study, to ensure the reliability of the conclusions, the trends of all
three components need to be consistent. This section discusses the consistency of the three
components based on the disturbance maximal orbit. Since the electric field components Ex,
Ey, and Ez, after background noise removal, exhibit more outliers, we employ the median
absolute deviation (MAD) method to eliminate these anomaly outliers. Subsequently, the
sliding averages method [31] is applied to smooth the signal, which reduces random noise
while preserving the original trend. Figure 9 illustrates the three-component electric field
plots for the 22°S to 65°S and 22°N to 65°N ranges across the four bands of the perturbed
maximum orbit. The figure shows that the trends of the curves for the different electric
field components Ex, Ey, and Ez are essentially consistent, with only slight variations in the
magnitudes of the energy amplitudes.

In the ULF band, the trend is consistent between the northern and southern hemi-
spheres, characterized by an initial increase followed by a decrease, with an extreme value
observed in the 0-5 Hz range. This value decreases after reaching its peak and subsequently
stabilizes. In contrast, trends in the ELF and VLF bands are not consistent between the
hemispheres. In the ELF band, the southern hemisphere shows a maximum near 2441 Hz,
whereas the northern hemisphere does not exhibit any significant extreme values. In the
VLF band, the southern hemisphere exhibits an extreme value at 5.40 kHz, while the north-
