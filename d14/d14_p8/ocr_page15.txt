4. Discussion
This paper analyzes the response of the ionospheric electric field to the November 4,
2021 magnetic storm using EFD data from the four frequency bands of the CSES-1 satellite
electric field. The analysis is conducted through power spectrogram analysis, D value
analysis, growth rate analysis, and wavelet coherence.
4.1. Comparison of Dayside and Nightside Data
The CSES-1 satellite observation data encompass both dayside and nightside measure-
ments. To compare the differences between dayside and nightside data, the ULF frequency
band was selected for PSD and D value analysis. Figure 15 presents a comparison of the
PSD at a single frequency point between the dayside and nightside. The red anomalies
at 3.9 Hz, 9.3 Hz, and 14.2 Hz are observed to be more widely distributed and denser
on the nightside compared to the dayside. Whether at high latitudes in the northern or
southern hemisphere or at the equator, the distinction between periods of magnetic storms
and periods of calm is not apparent in the dayside data. The nightside data also reveal
red anomalies at the equator and at low and mid latitudes, whereas during calm periods,
no such anomalies are observed on the nightside. At 14.2 Hz, there is still a red anomaly
area difference between the nightside data during the magnetic storm and those during
calm periods, but the PSD of the dayside data during the magnetic storm period is not
significantly different from that of the calm period. It is possible that there are also covered
perturbations in the dayside data, but the size of the perturbations is negligible for the
nightside data.
To quantitatively assess the ability of dayside data to monitor magnetic storms, D value
analysis was conducted on the ULF band data from the dayside. As shown in Figure 16,
during the main phase of the magnetic storm, no significant difference between the D value
during the magnetic storm and that of the quiet period is evident across 65°5-65°N or at
high latitudes in both hemispheres, where the impact of the magnetic storm is typically
strongest. In the D value analysis of the nightside data, the difference between the D value
at the maximum perturbation orbit and that of the quiet period reaches 2. Conversely, in
the D value analysis of the dayside data, the difference between the D value and that of the
