4.4. Hemispheric Asymmetry
There is a clear hemispheric asymmetry observed in this magnetic storm. In this study,

the maximum disturbance in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the first minimum

of Dst, while the maximum disturbance in the southern hemisphere corresponds to the
second minimum of Dst. The response of the high-latitude ionosphere in the northern
hemisphere occurs approximately 4 h earlier than that in the southern hemisphere. Dif-
ferent extreme values of Dst result in varying levels of perturbation due to hemispheric
energy imbalances caused by solar wind energy deposition. De Abreu [36] found, using

TEC data, that during the recovery phase, the mid-latitude region in North America ex-

perienced a strong and persistent negative storm phase, whereas the mid-latitude region

in South America exhibited calm daytime behavior. They proposed that the hemispheric
asymmetric response in the F-region of the ionosphere might reflect different mechanisms
for equatorial spread-F (ESF) generation across latitudinal regions during perturbations.

Terete and Nigussie [37] investigated the drivers of the ionospheric response to the storm of

17-18 March 2015 and found that the response of the high-latitude ionosphere in the

Northern Hemisphere occurred about 12 h earlier than in the Southern Hemisphere. They

suggested that spatial and temporal variations in solar wind energy deposition were re-

sponsible for the hemispheric asymmetry in ionospheric response. In addition, IMF By has
an impact on hemispheric asymmetry. The impacts of the interplanetary magnetic field

(IMF) east-west component (By) on the interhemispheric asymmetry of } O/N2 depletion

was investigated. Comparisons of simulation results with and without real By show that

the dominant positive IMF By results in the Joule heating maximum occurred in the local
afternoon of northern hemisphere and local morning in the southern hemisphere during

the initial phase of the storm, which generated the corresponding } O/N2 changes [38].
Zhima [25] proposed that ELF and VLF waves with frequencies below 6 kHz are

primarily observed during the early main phase and recovery phases of magnetic storms,

while wide-bandwidth waves from fcp to 20 kHz are significantly excited during the
main and early recovery phases. In this paper, analysis shows that waves below 6 kHz
are consistently present in the southern hemisphere, whereas the northern hemisphere
is not affected. During the main phase of magnetic storms, the excited wave frequencies
are predominantly below 18 kHz. Frequencies above 18 kHz, including those in the HF
band, experience minimal interference from magnetic storms. Therefore, the HF band
is particularly suitable for use in the design of future spacecraft and communication

equipment [39].

In summary, for the design of future spacecraft and communication equipment, it
is advisable to prioritize frequency bands above 18 kHz to mitigate interference from
magnetic storms. In the ELF/VLF bands, it is recommended to avoid frequencies below
6 kHz due to persistent interference observed in the southern hemisphere. Although the
ULF band exhibits the strongest response to magnetic storms, certain frequencies within
this band show reduced susceptibility to interference. For instance, the wavelet analysis
presented in Section 3.8 of this paper indicates that the correlation between magnetic storms
and frequencies of 6.8 Hz and 8.8 Hz is weak. Furthermore, relying solely on the minimum
value of Dst to classify magnetic storm intensity may be insufficient due to the effects of
solar wind energy deposition. For example, the Dst curve of this magnetic storm exhibits a
double-peak structure, indicating a greater accumulation of solar wind energy compared to
a storm with a single Dst peak. Thus, the D value index of electric field disturbances may
offer a more accurate classification metric in the future.

5. Conclusions
The analysis of this paper leads us to the following conclusions:

(1) The ULE ELF and VLF bands are more significantly perturbed by magnetic storms,
with the ULF band exhibiting the strongest response. Not only is the absolute incre-
ment in the D value larger in the ULF band compared to the ELF and VLF bands,
but the relative increment is also more pronounced, exceeding that of the ELF and
