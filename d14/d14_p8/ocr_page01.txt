Abstract: This paper investigates the impact characteristics of the 4 November 2021 magnetic storm
across different frequency bands based on the electric field data (EFD) from the China Seismo-
Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES), categorized into four frequency bands: ULF (Ultra-Low-Frequency,
DC to 16 Hz), ELF (Extremely Low-Frequency, 6 Hz to 2.2 kHz), VLF (Very Low-Frequency, 1.8 to
20 kHz), and HF (High-Frequency, 18 kHz to 3.5 MHz). The study reveals that in the ULF band,
magnetic storm-induced electric field disturbances are primarily in the range of 0 to 5 Hz, with a
significant disturbance frequency at 3.9 £ 1.0 Hz. Magnetic storms also enhance Schumann waves
in the ULF band, with 8 Hz Schumann waves dominating in the southern hemisphere and 13 Hz
Schumann waves dominating in the northern hemisphere. In the ELF band, the more pronounced
anomalies occur at 300 Hz-900 Hz and above 1.8 kHz, with the 300 Hz-900 Hz band anomalies
around 780 Hz being the most significant. In the VLF band, the electric field anomalies are mainly
concentrated in the 3-15 kHz range. The ELF and VLF bands exhibit lower absolute and relative
disturbance increments compared to the ULF band, with the relative perturbation growth rate
in the ULF band being approximately 10% higher than in the ELF and VLF bands. Magnetic
eaten storm-induced electric field disturbances predominantly occur in the ULF, ELF, and VLF bands,
