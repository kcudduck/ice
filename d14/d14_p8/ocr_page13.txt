3.8. Wavelet Coherence (WTC) Analysis
From the analysis above, it is clear that the ULF frequency band exhibits the strongest
response to magnetic storms. To determine the correlation between different frequencies
in the ULF band and magnetic storms, wavelet coherence analysis was performed on the
Dst curves and D value curves at various frequencies. We obtained wavelet coherence
spectrograms for the 22°5-65°5, 22°5-22°N, and 22°N-65°N regions. Spectrogram values
approaching 1 indicate high-energy regions (yellow areas), which represent strong correlations.
In the wavelet coherence spectrograms of Dst versus D value curves for the 22°5-65°S
range (Figure 12), there are significantly more high-energy zones at 2.9 Hz, 3.9 Hz, and
4.9 Hz compared to other frequencies. High-energy regions are clearly observed near
periods 4 and 16. Small, high-energy regions are noted at 11.2 Hz and 13.2 Hz (Schumann
wave frequency point) near periods 4 and 16, while 8.8 Hz shows almost no high-energy
regions. The frequencies 2.9 Hz, 3.9 Hz, and 4.9 Hz exhibit the strongest correlations with
magnetic storms and are significantly perturbed by their effects. In contrast, at 8.8 Hz, the
correlation with magnetic storms is very weak, indicating minimal impact from the storms.
In the 22°N-65°N range, high-energy regions remain more prominent at 2.9 Hz, 3.9 Hz,
and 4.9 Hz compared to other frequencies (Figure 13). The periods of these high-energy
regions are approximately 4 and 16. In contrast to 22°5-65°S, 7.8 Hz and 13.2 Hz also
exhibit distinct and prolonged high-energy regions at period 16. Since these two frequencies
correspond to Schumann wave frequencies, Schumann waves are more affected by magnetic
storm perturbations in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere.
In the 22°5-22°N range, no high-energy regions are observed during the main phase
of the magnetic storm, either at the 0-5 Hz frequency range or at the Schumann wave
frequency (Figure 14). The D value curves in this latitude range show a weak correlation
with the Dst curves. The correlation between electric field disturbances and magnetic
storms at mid and low latitudes is not significant, indicating that magnetic storms do
not directly or significantly induce electric field disturbances in the ionosphere at these
latitudes. In contrast, electric field disturbances at high latitudes are strongly correlated
with magnetic storm activity.
