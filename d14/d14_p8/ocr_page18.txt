to 22°N in Sections 3.2-3.4 reveal a significant enhancement of disturbances in the ULF
band, whereas disturbances in the ELF and VLF bands are comparatively weaker. The ELF
and VLF bands experience less pronounced perturbations than the ULF band.

The electric field perturbations observed in the equatorial ionosphere primarily result
from the penetration of electric fields from middle and high latitudes [33,34]. The iono-
sphere at middle and low latitudes largely shields the effects of high-latitude electric fields.
A sudden increase in magnetospheric convection causes the lower and middle latitude
ionosphere to be influenced by the enhanced dusk-to-dawn convective electric field from
the high-latitude ionosphere, until the magnetospheric structure realigns and a new shield-
ing state is established. Conversely, a rapid decrease in magnetospheric convection leads to
a temporary excess of dusk-to-dawn shielding electric fields, which affects lower latitudes
until shielding is re-established. The time scale for this shielding process is typically less
than one hour [35]. In this study, strong perturbation orbits in the 22°S to 22°N region are
typically 1-2 orbits, with each orbit observed for about 0.5 h, and the duration of strong
perturbations is less than 1 h. The D value of the ULF band in this region is generally
greater than 2, while the D values of the ELF and VLF bands do not exceed 2. Analysis in
Section 3.3 shows that the anomalous frequency bands of the equatorial ionospheric electric
field are concentrated in the 0-100 Hz range, with frequency bands above 100 Hz being
less affected by the high-latitude penetrating electric field.

To validate the hypothesis that equatorial ionospheric anomalies primarily occur
below 100 Hz, we plotted D value analyses for latitudes below 22° during the main phases
of five magnetic storms (Table 2) within the 0-300 Hz range (Figure 18). The horizontal
axis represents the time of the orbital observations. The equatorial ionospheric anomaly on
4 November 2021 was observed to be the strongest, with D values in the 0-100 Hz band
reaching nearly 2. The anomaly on 24 April 2023 was slightly weaker than that of 4 November
2021, exhibiting significant perturbations in the 0-50 Hz band. In contrast, the anomalies on
27 February 2023, 5 November 2023, and 11 May 2024 showed prominent perturbations below
50 Hz. Notably, the Dst minimum of the 11 May 2024 magnetic storm reached —409 nT, yet
it caused fewer equatorial ionospheric anomalies compared to the 4 November 2021 storm.
Thus, perturbations in the equatorial ionosphere induced by magnetic storms are not directly
correlated with the magnitude of the storms. Additionally, the frequency band of ionospheric
anomalies in the equatorial region is concentrated below 100 Hz.
