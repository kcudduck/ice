response of magnetic storms in the HF band is not as pronounced as in the ULF/ELF/VLF
bands, fewer studies have been conducted on magnetic storms using the HF band.

Although it is widely accepted that magnetic storms affect different frequencies and
bands differently, detailed conclusions regarding specific frequencies and bands are lack-
ing. In this paper, we utilize EFD spectrum data from CSES-1 to investigate the spectral
characteristics of frequencies and bands exhibiting strong disturbances in different regions
during the magnetic storm activity (Dst < —100 nT) on 4 November 2021. This paper fills
a gap in the study of the frequency and band of strong ionospheric disturbances during
magnetic storms.

2. Materials and Methods

The main scientific objective of the CSES-1 [12] is to monitor ionospheric perturbations
associated with natural hazards in the quest for possible anomaly forecasting. The CSES-1
completes 15.2 orbits around Earth per day, with an orbital period of ~94.6 min and a
five-day recursive period over the same geographic area with the ascending /descending
node local time of 02 a.m./02 p.m., respectively. Orbit altitude is 507 km. Eight payloads
are assembled on CSES-1, that is, a high-precision magnetometer (HPPM), search coil magne-
tometer (SCM), electric field detector (EFD), Langmuir probe (LA), plasma analyzer (PAP),
high-energy particle detector (HEPD), GNSS occultation receiver (GOR), and tri-band
beacon (IBB). The entire satellite is capable of acquiring 17.6 h of scientific exploration data
per day and has the capability of continuous exploration within the latitude of 65° north
and south at all hours of the day [27].

The electric field is detected by an electric field detector (EFD). The EFD is an ad-
vanced detector for space-based measurements of electric fields in a wide frequency band,
specifically conceived for operation in the ionosphere-magnetosphere transition zone. The
instrument, designed to be installed on the 3-axis stabilized CSES-1 satellite, includes:
4 probes exposed to the ionospheric plasma, accommodated on the tips of 4 booms (each
of them four meters long, deployed far from the spacecraft body in order to reduce the
electromagnetic disturbances induced by the satellite equipment) and a data acquisition
unit (for signal conditioning, sampling of input signals and spectral analysis). The electric
field detector (EFD) data of the CSES-1 satellite has waveform data (mV /m) and PSD (Hz)
data. The PSD data are obtained by Fourier transform of the waveform data. EFD retrieves
the electric field components measured between pairs of probes in the following bands:
ULF (Ultra-Low-Frequency, DC to 16 Hz), ELF (Extremely Low-Frequency, from 6 Hz to
2.2 kHz), VLF (Very Low-Frequency, 1.8 to 20 kHz), and HF (High-Frequency, from 18 kHz
to 3.5 MHz), with sampling rates of 128 Hz, 5 kHz, 50 kHz, and 10 MHz, respectively.

In this paper, EFD power spectrum data (PSD) and Dst data are used to study the
spatial and temporal characteristics of different magnetic storms, where the PSD data
of the electric field are from CSES-1 (https://www.leos.ac.cn/), the SML index data are
from the website (https: / /supermag.jhuapl.edu/), and the Dst data are from the website
(https:/ /wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html (accessed on 10 May 2024)).

2.1. Satellite Data Process

We use the average degree of difference between electric field data and the background
field data during magnetic storms, which we call the D value, as a criterion for determining
the magnitude of the effect of magnetic storms. The background field data are set to be a
revisited orbit in a quiet period (with Dst values ranging from —30 to 30 nT) within one
month before the current orbit. Since the revisit period of the CSES-1 satellite is 5 days, a
date with an interval of multiple of 5 can be used as the background field. Because the Dst
values from 28 October 2021 to 1 November 2021 are within the range above, it is a quiet
period. Therefore, the electric field power spectrum data of these 5 days are selected as the
