in the ULF band is larger than that in the ELF and VLF bands. Magnetic storms do not
significantly affect the HF band.

3.2. ULF Band’ D Value Analysis
As discussed above, the responses of magnetic storms observed at different frequen-
cies are different. The prevalent view of the storm—substorm relationship has been that
substorms are the main building blocks of storms [13]. Although this view was questioned,
both magnetic storms and substorms have an effect on the ionosphere [1], and magnetic
storms and substorms generally occur in tandem. A substorm event was also present
during the 4 November 2021 magnetic storm event. The disturbances recorded in the
satellite electric field were the result of a combination of magnetic storms and substorms.
Each frequency band contains many frequencies, and it is insufficient to analyze them
using the PSD plots of a single frequency point. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze all
frequencies collectively to identity the frequencies and bands most disturbed by magnetic
storms. From the above analysis, the disturbance caused by magnetic storms varies across
different regions. Therefore, the world is divided into three regions for analysis: 65°S to
65°N, 22°S to 65°S, 22°S to 22°N, and 22°N to 65°N. Table 1 lists the maximum D values
of the different bands, the corresponding frequencies, and the frequency bands that are
most disturbed.

Figure 4 shows the Dst index (a), SML index (b), and the D values from 1 November
2021 to 7 November 2021. The Dst index represents the intensity of the magnetic storm and
the SML index represents the intensity of the substorm. The Dst index decreases sharply
during magnetic storms, and the D values also show significant changes. The D values
in all four regions increase from approximately 0-1 to about 2 during the quiet period.
Comparing the high and middle-to-low latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres
reveals a clear difference in the anomalous enhancement of the electric field in the ULF
band. In the ranges 65°S to 65°N (c), 22°S to 65°S (d), and 22°S to 22°N (e), the maximum
perturbation orbits correspond to the second Dst minimum. The maximum perturbation
orbits in the range 22°N to 65°N (f) correspond to the first minimum. A clear hemispheric
asymmetry is observed. The maximum D value in the range of 65°S to 65°N (c) occurs
near 13 Hz, and the D value is essentially above 1.8 throughout the band. This is consistent
with the perturbation in the range 22°S to 22°N (e), where the maximum frequency point
of the perturbation is 13.2 Hz, corresponding to a maximum D value of 2.83. In contrast,
the maximum frequency point of the perturbation in the ranges 22°S to 65°S and 22°N to
65°N is not around 13 Hz, but is in the frequency band of 0-5 Hz. The maximum D value
