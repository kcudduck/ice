Figure 3. VLF, HF single-frequency PSD (the red rectangle is the main phase period).

Three frequencies, 3.9 Hz, 9.3 Hz, and 14.2 Hz, were selected for the ULF band. These
three frequencies showed significant disturbance enhancement on 4 November 2021 (blue
indicates quiet, red indicates disturbance). The main disturbance area is above 22°, and
the latitudinal extent of the disturbance varies over time. In the southern hemisphere,
the latitudinal extent of the disturbance gradually widens. In the northern hemisphere,
the latitudinal range of the disturbance first widens and then narrows. An electric field
disturbance with a duration of about 1 h (two orbits have color anomalies and one orbit’s
observation time is 0.5 h) occurs in the middle and low latitudes. The red anomalies at
3.9 Hz and 9.3 Hz are darker than those at 14.2 Hz, indicating that the disturbance strength
at these two frequencies is greater than that at 14.2 Hz.

In the ELF band, significant electric field disturbances were observed in the northern
hemisphere during the main phase of the magnetic storm. The disturbance pattern is similar
to that of the ULF band, with the red anomalous region being smaller in color intensity and
density. This indicates that the disturbance intensity and extent in the ELF band are smaller
than those in the ULF band. In the southern hemisphere, there is a constant electric field
disturbance in the range of 42°N to 65°N. A deepening of the red color during the main
phase indicates a strengthening of the constant electric field perturbation, although the
exact perturbation requires quantitative analysis later. Among the three frequencies in the
ELF band, the electric field perturbation is stronger at 1825 Hz than at 625 Hz and 1225 Hz.

There are significant differences in the perturbations at different frequencies in the VLF
band. The 12 kHz frequency point shows obvious disturbances in the northern hemisphere,
the 18 kHz frequency point shows slightly weaker disturbances, and the 6 kHz frequency
point shows almost no disturbances. In the southern hemisphere, there is a constant
disturbance in the VLF band in the range of 42°N to 65°N, which is weaker than that in
the ELF band. No significant electric field perturbations are observed at any of the three
frequencies in the HF band.

Comparing the four frequency bands, the frequencies in the ULF, ELF, and VLF bands
all show electric field perturbations during magnetic storms, whereas the frequencies in
the HF band show almost no perturbations. From the several frequencies illustrated in
the figure, the ULF band shows obvious electric field disturbances in both the northern
and southern hemispheres, while the ELF and VLF bands show obvious electric field
disturbances only in the northern hemisphere. The range of electric field disturbances
