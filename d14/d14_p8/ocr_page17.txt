magnetic storm reached an extreme value at 4.4 Hz). After reaching the extreme value,
the D values began to fluctuate and then decrease. In the northern hemisphere, the five
magnetic storms generally reached an extreme value around 2.9 Hz (e.g., the 11 May 2024
storm reached 4.8 Hz), after which the D values began to fluctuate and decrease. The
magnetic storms of 27 February 2023 and 6 November 2023 exhibited extreme values at the
Schumann resonance frequency of 13 Hz. Within the 0-5 Hz range, the magnitude of the D
values of the five magnetic storms was generally negatively correlated with the magnitude
of the Dst values, with the exception of the 24 April 2023 storm, which had a relatively small
D value in the northern hemisphere. In the ULF band, the disturbance extreme frequencies
of the magnetic storms were predominantly distributed around 3.9 = 1.0 Hz, with a few
storms showing extremes near the Schumann resonance frequency of 13 Hz.

Figure 17. Frequencies of significant disturbances in multiple magnetic storms.

The ULF band exhibited significant perturbation enhancements near 8 Hz and 13 Hz,
in addition to the strong perturbation observed in the 0-5 Hz range. These perturbations
were also present during quiet periods. According to Sanfui [32], the maximum values of
the Schumann resonance first-, second-, and third-order mode frequencies were 8.51 Hz,
14.71 Hz, and 21.22 Hz, respectively, and constant perturbations from Schumann waves
were clearly observed in this context as well. Therefore, the perturbations near 8 Hz
and 13 Hz identified in the D value analysis of the ULF band were primarily due to
Schumann waves. These Schumann waves were also enhanced by magnetic storms, with
the enhancement at 13 Hz being greater than at 8 Hz. Additionally, there were hemispheric
differences in Schumann waves: 8 Hz predominated from 22°S to 65°S, while 13 Hz
predominated from 22°N to 65°N.

4.3. Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly

Magnetic storms primarily atfect middle and high latitudes, but they also impact
equatorial and low latitudes. In the PSD analysis presented in Section 3.1, the ULF band
exhibits a notable disturbance enhancement at middle and low latitudes, though not as
pronounced as in the ELF and VLF bands. The D value analyses covering the range of 22°S
