Tirunelveli. This figure shows that the ionogram traces were completely absent from 0,640 to 0700 UT and

became very faint from 0,700 to 0720 UT. This indicates that the radiowaves were absorbed by intense ionization — §

in the D- and E-regions, caused by this solar flare, resulting in a radio blackout in the 2-12 MHz frequency band. ~~ &

4. Summary and Conclusions :

A series of Solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) occurred from 8 to 9 May 2024, interacted with one ~~ %

another on their voyage toward Earth, and formed a composite ICME that impacted Earth's magnetosphere around H

1705 UT on tenth May 2024. At least two distinct ICMESs can be identified within this ICME, which reached the  £

L1-point at 1634 UT and 2136 UT. The corresponding shock signatures in ground-based magnetometers were Z

observed at 1705 UT and 2221 UT. The globally averaged surface geomagnetic field (Sym-H index) was S

depressed by 518 nT, making it the most intense geomagnetic storm of the past three decades and the second- Z

largest in the space era (in terms of Sym-H index). The strong SWDP associated with this composite ICME ~~ £

caused Earth's dayside magnetopause to be pushed below the geostationary orbit (6.6 Rg) for continuously ~6 hr. Z

Furthermore, the Earth's magnetospheric bow shock was also found to compress below the geostationary orbit for ~~ 2

about 3 min. The BATSRUS model simulations suggest that the magnetopause location could have been as low as ~~ ©

3.3 Rg during the peak phase of the storm. Our study further reveals that a potent combination of high SWDP 3

E g peak p y p g =

(>15 nPa) with intense eastward IEF, (>2.5 mV/m) that lasted for 409 min is the key factor responsible for the E

development of a strong ring current at much closer to the Earth, making this storm uniquely intense. Severe ©

electrodynamic disturbances caused strong eastward PPEFs, significantly intensified EIA, and large SED d

(>100%) in the dayside ionosphere, which can severely affect the positioning/navigation based on single- g

frequency GPS receivers. The enhanced D- and E-region ionization due to an X3.9 solar flare at ~0654 UT ES

caused the absorption of radio waves in the range 2-12 MHz, resulting in an HF radio blackout over the Indian S

sector. 5
