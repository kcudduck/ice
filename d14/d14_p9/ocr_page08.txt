Figure 6. Comparison of most intense storms with peak negative Sym-H less than —300 nT occurred during solar cycles 23-25 along with the present storm. Shaded S

region indicates the periods with SWDP > 15 nPa simultaneously with IEFY > 2.5 mV/m [refer text and Table-1 for more details]. 5

storm's main phase develops with the arrival of a low-density (low SWDP) magnetic cloud with sustained g

southward Bz (Temmer & Bothmer, 2022; Burlaga et al., 1982; Lepping et al., 1997; Gonzalez & B. Tsur- :

utani, 1987; Gonzalez et al., 2011; Kilpua et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2020). However, in the present storm case, a o

series of CME:s interacted with each other and formed a composite ICME on their journey to Earth. At least two =

distinct ICMEs can be identified around 1634 UT and 2136 UT within this composite ICME from the solar wind =

observations at L1-point. This composite ICME structure consisted of a rare and unique combination of elevated E

SWDP (high-density) and sustained southward IMF Bz for several hours. :

To highlight the uniqueness of this ICME structure and the resultant storm, a comparison of the most intense :

geomagnetic storms with peak negative Sym-H less than —300 nT occurred in the solar cycles 23 and 24 1s made p

in Figure 6. Figures 6a—61 show the variations of SWDP and interplanetary electric field, IEF, (-V x IMF Bz), and =

Sym-H index during 7 April 2000, 31 March 2001, 20 November 2003, 7-8 November 2004, 15 May 2005, and {

10-11 May 2024 (present storm), respectively. The Halloween storms that occurred during 29-31 October 2003 5

and 5 Novovember 2,001 storms could not be examined here due to the unavailability of corresponding solar wind ~~ §

data. Here, the IEFy 1s presented (instead of IMF Bz), which 1s a more commonly used parameter (directly or :

indirectly) to represent the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling efficiency (Akasofu, 1980; Burton et al., 1975;  &

O'Brien & McPherron, 2000; Newell et al., 2007). By examining Figures 6a—6f, one distinct feature that can be 2

observed 1s the high SWDP conditions sustained for long hours (throughout the main phase) during 10-11 May =

2024 compared to other storms. As discussed above, a potent combination of high SWDP and eastward IEFy can =~ 32

cause a strong ring current to flow at much closer distances to the Earth, leading to a large decrease in the 2

geomagnetic field. For example, a combination of SWDP > 15 nPa and IEFy > 2.5 mV/m is considered as a ~~

criterion for comparison among the storms presented in Figures 6a—61f. The shaded region with a light blue color °

represents the periods that satisfy the above criterion. From Figure 6f, one can observe that such a potent 2

combination of SWDP > 15 nPa and IEFy, > 2.5 mV/m lasted for a total of 409 min out of the total main phase of =

539 min during the present storm. On the other hand, such a combination of SWDP > 15 nPa and IEFy, > 2.5 mV/

m occurred for only 54, 132,79, 78, and 68 min during the 6 April 2000, 31 March 2001, 20 November 2003, 7-8 d

November 2004, and 15 May 2005 storms (Figures 6a—6¢), respectively. This difference in the SWDP and IEF, =

conditions makes the present storm distinctly different from the other intense storms that occurred in the past. EB
