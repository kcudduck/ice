period. Similar compressions of magnetopause and bow-shock inside the geostationary orbit were earlier reported
for the 31 March 2001 storm (Ober et al., 2002). L
When the particles in the magnetosphere flow toward the Earth, they encounter an increasingly strong magnetic =
field. The positive gradient of the geomagnetic field 1s further amplified due to the compression of the magne- z
tosphere. Consequently, the particles undergo a rapid transverse motion due to a stronger gradient drift force, and =
the resulting ring current flows at much closer distances to the Earth (Daglis et al., 1999 and references therein]. E
The more the magnetosphere 1s compressed, the more intense the ring current becomes and the closer it flows to d
the Earth. However, the location of the magnetopause 1s influenced by two factors: (a) the geomagnetic pressure E
balance with the SWDP (Holzer & Slavin, 1978) and (b) erosion of the magnetosphere via magnetic reconnection -
with IMF, which maximizes during the intense southward-oriented IMF Bz (Maezawa, 1974). Southward IMF Bz 4
also facilitates enhanced injection of solar wind particles into the magnetosphere, then to the ring current region 8
(Dungey, 1961). A potent combination of strong SWDP and intense southward IMF Bz can push the magne- 4
topause to much lower distances, guiding the intense ring current to flow much closer to the Earth. This was what 3]
occurred during this storm, where the SWDP was maintained above 15 nPa throughout the main phase (except for 5
a few brief intervals), and the IMF Bz turned strongly southward for several sustained intervals. :
The ICME structures that trigger geomagnetic storms typically comprise a forward shock and a high-density d
sheath, followed by a low-density and high-magnetic field cloud region (Burlaga et al., 1998; Gopalsw-  %
amy, 2006). The sheath region exerts strong SWDP on the magnetosphere; however, the highly fluctuating IMF :
(Temmer & Bothmer, 2022) may not facilitate a stable dayside reconnection. The major part of the geomagnetic -
