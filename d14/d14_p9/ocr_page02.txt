largest storm 1n the past three decades and the second largest in the history of the space age (after the 13 March E

1989 storm). :

In this study, we investigate the factors and possible mechanisms that led to this super-intense storm in com- E

parison with other intense storms that occurred in the past, and the key findings are reported here. Additionally, :

we detail the drastic reconfiguration of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system and the resultant effects on the »

geomagnetic field and ionospheric electron content during this storm and a solar flare that occurred prior to this :

storm. 8

2. Data 7

A wide set of space-borne and ground-based measurements alongside magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations :

are employed in this study. The X-ray flux measurements at short (0.5—4.0 A) and long (1.0-8.0 A) wavelengths ]

from Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) on board the Geostationary Operational Envi- S

ronmental Satellites (GOES) (Machol et al., 2020) are examined to detect the solar flare occurrences. The solar =

wind particle and magnetic field measurements from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) near the E

first Lagrange (LL1) point were used to investigate the solar wind conditions that led to this intense storm. The 5

calibrated Level-2 data from Faraday Cup and Magnetometer payloads available at 1-min resolution are :

considered (Loto'aniu et al., 2022) 1n this study. A network of ground-based flux gate magnetometers spread :

across the Indian equatorial and low-latitudes (IIG, 2024) have been used to investigate the geomagnetic field z

disturbances that occurred during this storm. The VLF signal amplitude recorded by an NWC receiver (Lohrey & =

Kaiser, 1979; Xia et al., 2020) and 1onograms from a Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI) (Mac- :

Dougall et al., 1995) are used to examine the disturbances in the ionospheric D- and F-regions during a solar flare :

that occurred prior to this storm. The list of stations hosting the magnetometers, VLF receiver, and Ionosonde over =

the Indian region, along with their locations, are provided in Supporting Information S1. :

Further, the BATSRUS (Block-Adaptive-Tree-Solarwind-Roe-Upwind-Scheme) global magnetospheric MHD :

model (Harel et al., 1981; Powell et al., 1999) coupled with Rice Convection Model (RCM) (Toffoletto :

et al., 2003) and Ridley Ionospheric Model (RIM) (Ridley et al., 2004) 1s used to examine the location of g

magnetopause (L,p) and to investigate the ring current intensity. The BATSRUS had been run under the Space ~~ ¢€

Weather ‘Modeling Framework (SWMF) at the Community Coordinate Modeling Center (CCMC) platform for 3

the given solar wind inputs obtained from DSCOVR. :

3. Results and Discussion ;

3.1. Sources of the Storm :

During 8-10 May 2024, a series of solar flares and CMEs erupted from the sunspot group AR3664°. Figure 1 Zz

shows the X-ray flux at short (0.5—4 A, red curve) and long (1.0-8.0 A, blue curve) wavelengths monitored by the 5

GOES during this period. Several solar flares that occurred during this period are evident as sharp enhancements

in the X-ray flux. Six X-class flares occurred during this period as shown in Figure 1. The peak X-ray flux timings 2

of these flares were 0141, 0509, 2140 UT on 8 May 2024, 0913 UT, 1744 UT on 9 May 2024, and 0654 UT on 10 :
