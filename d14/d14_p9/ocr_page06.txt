Figure 4. UT variations of (a) SWDP (b)—(c) Bz and By from GOES-18 (black) and DSCOVR (red) satellites, 2
(d) Magnetopause location (Lp) from BATSRUS model. The shaded region indicates the intervals when the magnetopause 2
1s pushed below the geostationary orbit (6.6 RE), thereby exposing GOES-18 to shocked solar wind in the magnetosheath. :
The pink box 1n panels (b) and (c¢) indicates the time period expanded and shown in Figure 5, wherein the bow-shock also ES
pushed below the geostationary orbit for about 3 min. <
observations reveal two important facts: (a) the magnetopause was pushed to below 6.6 RE continuously for ~6 hr H
(1705-2252 UT), and (b) the IMF Bz and By were amplified ~4 times due to compression/accumulation of flux in :
the magnetosheath. The decrease of SWDP around 2252 UT caused relaxation of magnetopause to above 6.6 RE, 4
as seen from the clear deviation of Bz and By measured by GOES-18 from the DSCOVR measurements. :
However, variations in the SWDP caused several geostationary orbit crossings (compressions and relaxations) of ~~ £
magnetopause during the next 4 hours. The shaded area in light blue [Figures 4b and 4c] indicates the times when :
the magnetopause was pushed below the GOES-18 orbit. Figure 4d shows the variation of magnetopause location, ~~ Z
Lye (the minimum distance of magnetopause (boundary of closed field lines) from Earth within 30° longitudes Z
(1.e., 1,000 to 1,400 MLT) from the Sun-Earth lineestimated by the BATSRUS MHD model. The model also 2
predicted the magnetopause location below the geostationary orbit during ~1705—~2300 UT. which 1s consistent :
with that inferred from the GOES-18 observations. The model results further indicate that the Lp was pushed to s
as low as 3.31 Rg at 1852 UT and about 3.34 Rp at 2222 UT. Another interesting observation of severe  &
compression of Earth's magnetosphere and magnetosheath is presented in Figure 5. The panels from top to bottom ~~ £
display the variations of Bx, By and Bz components (black curves) measured by GOES-18 at 6.6 RE, respectively.  %
The red curves represent the IMF Bx, By and Bz from the DSCOVR at L1-point. The GOES-18 observations of >
Bx, By, and Bz exhibit rapid fluctuations, indicating turbulence in the shocked IMF in the magnetosheath region. J
Interestingly, one can observe that the turbulence was absent for a brief period of ~3 min during ~2030-2033 UT.  ¢
During this period, the magnetic field components measured by GOES-18 were nearly identical to those from :
DSCOVR. This suggests that the GOES-18 was indeed going out of the bow-shock region and measuring the 5
unshocked IMF. In other words, the strong compression conditions led even the bow-shock to be pushed below g
the geostationary orbit (6.6 RE) during this brief period. Therefore, the results from Figures 4 and 5 indicate the 5
strongly compressive conditions of the Earth's magnetosphere and the bow-shock prevailed during this storm 0
