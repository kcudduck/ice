also Sym-H) exhibited a sharp increase (recovery) due to the northward (eastward) turning of IMF Bz (By) 1
(Figure 3a) and partly due to enhanced magnetopause currents. Both the Sym-H and BATSRUS Dst decreased c
again with the southward turning of IMF Bz, and the main phase of the storm continued. However, the BATSRUS :
Dst is remained significantly higher than the Sym-H throughout the rest of the storm. While the peak negative  &
®,

Sym-H of —518 nT occurred at ~0214 UT, the peak negative in BATSRUS Dst (—342 nT) occurred around 0745 =
UT on 11 May 2024. In brief, the BATSRUS significantly underestimated the storm intensity after the arrival of =
the second ICME. The observed deviations in the BATSRUS Dst with respect to Sym-H could be due to the E
method of deriving the Dst in the model. In the BATSRUS model under SWMF, the Dst index is calculated by — £
computing the ground perturbations, through Biot-Savart law integrals, caused by the magnetospheric currents, >
field-aligned currents (FAC), and the ionospheric Pedersen and Hall currents (Yu et al, 2010; Leihmohn ©
et al., 2018). Although the detailed investigation of contributions from different current systems is beyond the ;
scope of this paper, we speculate that the insufficient representation of magnetospheric currents (mainly the ring :
current) could be one of the important sources for the observed deviation in the BATSRUS Dst. The contributions :
from the FAC and ionospheric Pedersen and Hall currents are generally expected to be very small at low latitudes, E
and to the Dst (Yu et al., 2010). d
Figure 3c shows the latitudinal distribution of disturbance in the H-component observed from a chain of low- :
latitude magnetometers from the Indian sector. The latitudes of magnetometer stations are shown as black  §
