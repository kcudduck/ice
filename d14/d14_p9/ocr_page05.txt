Figure 3. (a—b) UT variations of vertical and dawn-dusk components of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF B, and By, top panel), and Sym-H (bottom panel). =

(¢) Latitudinal distribution of isturbance in geomagnetic H-component field observed from the Indian network of magnetometers. The latitudes of magnetometer 2

stations are indicated as black dots in Figure 3c. 3

stations and their geographic locations are shown (Figure S1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). The =

disturbance in the horizontal (H-) component at different stations is computed by subtracting the H-component ~~ =

variation of a previously quiet day (9 May 2024) from the variations of storm days (10 and 11 May 2024) for =

the respective stations. It can be noticed that the peak disturbance-H was nearly —600 nT at latitudes close to the

geomagnetic equator and exhibits slightly lower values away from the equator. A sharp positive disturbance in H ]

due to the onset of solar flare around ~0650 UT can also be seen in Figure 3c. This enhancement in H due to the 2

solar flare 1s more prominent (~105 nT) close to the equator, while the amplitudes were reduced sharply at =

latitudes northward of the equator. This equatorial enhancement in H during the solar flare is mainly due to the 2

enhanced E-region conductivity by X-ray photoionization, which will be further amplified at the equator by the S

Cowling effect (Rastogi et al., 1999, 2017; Sripathi et al., 2013). It may also be noted that the magnetometer  £

stations are spread over 70.74°E-92.76°E longitudes (see Figure S1 and Table S1 in Supporting Information S1), :

which may introduce minor local time-dependent variations in E-region conductivities. However, it would not p

much effect the results presented in Figure 3c, as it shows the disturbance H (residual) after the removal of diurnal =

variation, as mentioned above. Hence, the minor differences in the local times, and the resultant differences in E- {

region conductivities (if any) due to longitudinal separation are ignored here.3.2 Key Factors and Possible 5

Mechanisms. :

The factors responsible for this super-intense storm are investigated in Figure 4. The top panel shows the UT =

variation of solar wind dynamic pressure (SWDP), which exhibits several oscillations but has remained at high E

levels (>15 nPa) for several hours since the arrival of the first ICME shock. Here, SWDP = m,N V? where N and d

V are the solar wind density and velocity, respectively, and m,, 1s the proton mass. Figures 4b and 4c show the Bz E]

and By components (black curves) measured from the GOES-18 (137°W longitude, 6.6 RE altitude). Before the -

arrival of ICME, the GOES-18 was well within the Earth's magnetosphere, measuring Bz and By to be around 100 ¢

and 30 nT, respectively. Sudden changes in the Bz and By can be observed with the arrival of ICME at 1705 UT, 8

and within a few minutes, the Bz measured by GOES-18 turned southward. Bz and By measured by GOES-18 4

exhibit rapid fluctuations (due to turbulence) in the magnetic field. The southward turning of Bz and the tur- 3

bulence in Bz and By indicate that GOES-18 was indeed measuring the shocked IMF outside the magnetopause 5

(in the magnetosheath region). The strong SWDP exerted by ICME pushed the magnetopause below the geo- :

stationary orbit (6.6 Rg), exposing the GOES-18 to shocked and turbulent IMF in the magnetosheath region. Zz

The red curves in Figures 4b and 4c are the IMF Bz and By measured by DSCOVR satellite at L1. Here, the Bz ~~ §

and By from DSCOVR are multiplied by 4 for a better comparison with GOES-18 observations. It is interesting to 2

see that the Bz and By from GOES-18 at 6.6 Rg followed similar variations to those from DSCOVR at L1. These = =
