X -10 YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY

of solar wind plasma and IMF parameters including Bz and Ey. We found a consistency
between time evolution of cause (Bz and Ey) and time evolution of effect (Dst, Dst*
(pressure corrected Dst), Kp and AF indices) for the time interval of 70”—"6" as depen-
dence of indices on integral value of sources, for example, Dsti.vs. Ey(Y)! = [& Ey(r)dr =
StEYF i=0,..,6;k=0,..,1.

Dependencies of Dst (or Dst*) on the integral of Bz (or Ey) over time are almost linear
and parallel for different types of drivers. This fact can be considered as an indication
that time evolution of main phase of storms depends not only on current values of Bz
and Ey, but also on their prehistory. The differences between these lines are relatively
small (| ADst |< 20 nT). Nevertheless we can make following comparisons. For various
drivers we approximated data near central parts dependencies by linear functions and
calculated values of Dst (or Dst*) at fixed values of integral of Bz and integral of Fy
(fy Bz(t)dr = —30 h*nT and [; Ey(7r)dr = 12 h*mV/m) (see Table 3). It should be
noted that used value of integral of Fy is located near threshold of generation of magnetic
storms with Dst < —50 nT (i.e. used interval of integral of Fy contains data for almost all
magnetic storms) | Nikolaeva et al., 2012]. Taking into account that difference in "efficiency
coefficients” for various drivers are mathematically significant when they differ more than
10% (i.e. 0.25 nT/(h*nT) for Bz and 0.5 nT/(h*mV /m) for Ey), it is possible to note
that: (1) Dependencies of Dst (or Dst*) on the integral of Bz (or Ey) are higher in CIR,
Sheath and Ejecta, than in MC, (i.e., efficiency of MC for process of magnetic storm
generation is the lowest one); (2) Efficiency of CIR, Sheath and Ejecta are closed to each
other. Dependencies of Kp (and AE) on integral of Bz (and Ey) are nonlinear (there
is the saturation effect for AE index) and nonparallel. Nevertheless we made the same
