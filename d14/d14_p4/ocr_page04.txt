indicates that it is necessary to take into account the influence of other (in addition to IMF
Bz and electric field Fy) parameters of the solar wind, dynamics of parameter variation,
and different mechanisms of generating the magnetospheric disturbances at different types
of solar wind streams. Several recent papers analyzed separately CIR, Sheath and body
of ICME and compared them with each other |Huttunen and Koskinen, 2004; Yermolaev

Papers mentioned above are devoted studying of response of magnetosphere to inter-
planetary drives and use word geoeffectiveness for a designation of this link. It should
be noted that there is a double meaning of the term geoeffectiveness. In one case, geoef-
fectiveness implies a probability with which selected phenomenon can cause a magnetic
storm, i.e., the ratio between the number of events of a chosen type resulting in a magnetic
storm and the total number of these events. In the other case, geoeffectiveness implies the
efficiency of storm generation by unambiguously interrelated phenomena, i.e., the ratio
between the output” and “input” of a physical process, for example, between the values
of the Dst index and the southward IMF Bz component. Below we will use the term
geoeffectiveness for a designation of probability of relation between the phenomena and
the term efficiency for a designation of efficiency of process relating phenomena.

A considerable quantity of papers is devoted investigations of geoeffectiveness in gen-
eration of magnetic storm. The great bulk of works studies geoeftectiveness of magnetic
