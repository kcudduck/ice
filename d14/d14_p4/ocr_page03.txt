YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY X-3
1. Introduction
One of key issues of the solar-terrestrial physics is investigation of mechanisms of energy
transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere and of excitation of magnetospheric
disturbances. As has been discovered by direct space experiments in the beginning of
1970s, the basic parameter leading to magnetospheric disturbances is negative (southward)
Bz component of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) (or electric field Fy = Va x Bz)
Dungey, 1961; Fairfield and Cahill, 1966; Rostoker and Falthammar, 1967; Russell et al.,
1974; Burton et al., 1975; Akasofu, 1981]. Numerous investigations demonstrated that
IMF in the undisturbed solar wind lies in the ecliptic plane (i.e., Bz is close to zero)
and only disturbed types of the solar wind streams can have a considerable value of IMF
Bz. The interplanetary CME (ICME) with a compression region Sheath before it and
the compression region between slow and fast solar wind streams (Corotating Interaction
Region, CIR) belong to such types of solar wind streams (see reviews and recent papers,
for instance, by Tsurutani et al. [1988]; Tsurutani and Gonzalez [1997|; Gonzalez et al.
11999]; Yermolaev and Yermolaev [2002]; Huttunen and Koskinen [2004]; Echer and Gon-

Experimental results showed that the magnetospheric activity induced by different types
of interplanetary streams is different |Borovsky and Denton, 2006; Denton et al., 2006;
