X - 2 YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY
Abstract.

We investigate relative role of various types of solar wind streams in gen-
eration of magnetic storms. On the basis of the OMNI data of interplane-
tary measurements for the period of 1976-2000 we analyze 798 geomagnetic
storms with Dst < â€”-50 nT" and their interplanetary sources: corotating in-
teraction regions (CIR), interplanetary CME (ICME) including magnetic clouds
(MC) and Ejecta and compression regions Sheath before both types of ICME.
For various types of solar wind we study following relative characteristics:
occurrence rate; mass, momentum, energy and magnetic fluxes; probability
of generation of magnetic storm (geoeffectiveness) and efficiency of process
of this generation. Obtained results show that despite magnetic clouds have
lower occurrence rate and lower efficiency than CIR and Sheath they play
an essential role in generation of magnetic storms due to higher geoeffective-
ness of storm generation (i.e higher probability to contain large and long-
term southward IMF Bz component).
