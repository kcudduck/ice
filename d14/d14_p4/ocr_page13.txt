YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY X-13
generation process by Sheath than MC are discussed in several papers |Huttunen and
Koskinen, 2004; Huttunen et al., 2006; Yermolaev et al., 2007a, b, c, 2010c; Pulkkinen et
al., 2007a; Turner et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2011]. Our results confirm this conclusion.

Thus obtained results show that despite low occurrence rate and low efficiency of mag-
netic clouds they play an essential role in generation of magnetic storms due to high
geoeffectiveness of storm generation (i.e high probability to contain large and long-term
southward IMF Bz component). Geoeffectivenesses of CIR and Sheath are lower but they
are compensated by higher occurrence rate and efficiency.
