YERMOLAEV ET AL... GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY X-9
clouds, and geoeffectiveness of other phenomena is studied rather poorly (see, for exam-
ple, one of recent reviews by Yermolaev and Yermolaev [2006, 2010]; Alves et al. [2011].
S50, one of the main aims of current paper is investigation of geoeffectiveness of various
interplanetary drivers and comparison of them to each other.

Efficiencies of various interplanetary drivers vary with the type of solar wind streams
and may be estimated as the ratio of measured energy output to estimated energy input
(see, for example, paper by Turner et al. [2009]; Yermolaev et al. [2010c| and references
therein). In our investigations, we use Bz (Ey) and magnetospheric indices Dst, Dst*
(pressure corrected Dst), Kp and AE as ”input” and “output” of the storm generation
processes for the estimation of efficiency of interplanetary drivers.

2. Methods

When the types of solar wind streams were classified, we used OMNI database (see
http: //omniweb.gsfc. nasa.gov | King and Papitashvili, 2004]) for interval 1976-2000 and
available world experience in identification of solar wind streams and the standard cri-
teria for following parameters: velocity V, density NN, proton temperature 7', ratio of
thermal to magnetic pressure (S-parameter), ratio of measured temperature to tempera-
ture calculated on basis of average ”velocity-temperature” relation T/T exp | Lopez, 1987],
thermal pressure and magnetic field. This method allows us to identify reliably 3 types of
quasi-stationary streams of the solar wind (heliospheric current sheet (HCS), fast streams
from the coronal holes, and slow streams from the coronal streamers), and 5 disturbed
types (compression regions before fast streams (CIR), and interplanetary manifestations
of coronal mass ejections (ICME) that can include magnetic clouds (MC) and Ejecta
with the compression region Sheath preceding them). In contract with Ejecta, MCs have
