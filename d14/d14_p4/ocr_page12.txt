X -12 YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY
tistical characteristics and distributions of the solar wind and IMF parameters in various
types of the streams well agree with previously obtained results

During the full time from 1976 to 2000 the different types of the solar wind were ob-
served: HCS for 6 + 4%, MC for 2 + 1%, Ejecta for 20 & 6%, Sheath before Ejecta for
8 + 4%, Sheath before MC for 0.8 + 0.7%, and CIR for 10 Â£ 3% of the total observation
time. About 53% of the entire observation time fell on fast and slow solar wind (21.5%
and 31.5% of time, respectively) (see Figure 1 and Table 1). Large values of mass, mo-
mentum and energy are transported from the Sun to the Earth by CIR and Sheath, and
of magnetic field by MC (see Figure 2).

Probabilities that conditions in the interplanetary space allow to input solar wind energy
to magnetosphere and generate magnetic storm with Dst < -50 nT are about 55% for MC
(63% for MC with Sheath), about 20% for CIR, about 8% for Ejecta (21% for Ejecta with
Sheath) and 15% for Sheath (see Table 2). Because of different occurrence rates of different
solar wind streams it was found that 35% storms were generated by Ejecta with/without
Sheath, 31% by CIR and 24% by MC with/without Sheath (about 20% by Sheath before
MC and Ejecta). Taking into account dependence of numerical estimation on used method
of data analysis , values of geoeffectiveness obtained by us for MC and Ejecta (both with
Sheath and without Sheath) are in a good agreement with previous result (see review by
Yermolaev and Yermolaev [2010]). Our estimation of CIR geoeffectiveness (about 20%)
is lower than one obtained early by Alves et al. [2006].

Our estimations show that efficiency of MC for process of magnetic storm generation
(for Dst and Dst* indices) is the lowest one and efficiency for Kp and AF indices is
higher for CIR and Sheath than for MC and Ejecta. Higher efficiency of magnetic storms
