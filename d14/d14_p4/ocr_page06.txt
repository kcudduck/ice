X-6 YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY

lower temperature, lower ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure (S-parameter) and higher,
smooth and rotating magnetic field |Burlaga, 1991]. In addition, we have included into
our catalog such events (rare enough) as direct and reverse shocks, and the rarefaction
region (region with low density) Rare but these types of events are not analyzed in this
paper.

In order to calculate yearly averaged values, we have taken into consideration that the
OMNI database contains gaps of the data from 0 to 50% time of year. This procedure
has been made in the assumption that occurrence rate of given type of solar wind streams
is similar both in intervals of data presence and in intervals of data gap. If during chosen
year the number of events of selected solar wind type Ne has been registered in interval of
data presence t; the normalized number of the given solar wind type Ne* in this year was
defined by multiplication of occurrence rate of the given solar wind type Ne/t; to total
duration of year t,, i.e. Ne* = (Ne/t;) *t,. Normalized number of solar wind events is
used only for studying the time variations in occurrence rate of various types of streams
and measured number of events is used to calculate geoeffectiveness of types of events.
When we analyzed durations of different types of solar wind streams, we selected intervals
of types of streams which have not data gaps at both edges of the intervals.

Definite types of the solar wind streams were put in correspondence to all magnetic
storms for which measurements of the parameters of plasma and magnetic field in the
interplanetary medium were available. This was done using the following algorithm. If
the moment of minimum in the Dst index from the list of magnetic storms falls within
the time interval of a solar wind event or is apart from it by no more than 2 h interval,
the corresponding solar wind type is ascribed to this storm. It should be noted that,
