X - 8 YERMOLAEV ET AL.: GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY
3.1. Occurrence rate of different types of solar wind streams

In order to estimate geoeflectiveness of different types of solar wind streams it is nec-
essary to have a total list of these types of streams during sufficiently large time interval
and with sufficiently large statistics. Measured and normalized numbers per year, average
durations, temporal parts in total times of observations as well as average values and their
standard deviations of several plasma and magnetic field parameters for various solar wind
types have been presented in our publication | Yermolaev et al., 2009, 2010a, b, cÂ¢, d, 2011].
It should be noted that both types of compressed regions (CIR and Sheath) have very
close values of parameters while the parameters for 2 types of ICME (Ejecta and MC) are
different. In figure 1 we present yearly average values of sunspots (top panel) and yearly
average distributions of times of observations for different types of solar wind streams
(bottom panel). Data for different types of streams are showed by various color columns
(see designation on the right of the figure) with height proportional to percent of obser-
vation time. On the average the quasi-steady types of solar wind streams (Fast, Slow
and HCS) contain about 60% of all solar wind observations near the Earth but time of
disturbed types of streams decreases down to 25% during solar minimum and increases
up to 50% during solar maximum.

Various types of solar wind streams transport different values of mass, momentum,
energy and magnetic field from the Sun to the Earth. Figure 2 shows average distributions
(percentage) of values (red columns) and total Suns losses (parameters integrated over
time, blue columns) mass, momentum, energy and magnetic fluxes for different types of
solar wind streams. High average values for mass, momentum, and energy fluxes are
observed in compressed regions CIR and Sheath and magnetic flux in MC, but their total
