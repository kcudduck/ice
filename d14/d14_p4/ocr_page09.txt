losses are higher in steady types of streams (Fast and Slow) than in disturbed types of
streams. In following sections of the paper we will analyze how occurrence rate of different
types of streams and mass, momentum, energy and magnetic field transferred by these
streams influence generation of magnetic storms.

3.2. Geoeflectiveness of interplanetary drivers

For the entire period of time 1976-2000, 798 moderate and strong magnetic storms with
the intensity Dst < â€”50 nT were observed on the Earth (see figure 3). But only for 464
magnetic storms (i.e., for 58% of all magnetic storms) corresponding various events were
found in the solar wind. The sources of other 334 magnetic storms (i.e., of 42% of 798
storms, grey columns in figure 3) are undeterminate, and this fact is mainly connected
with the lack of data on plasma and interplanetary magnetic field which makes impossible
to identify the solar wind type for magnetic storm intervals. Figure 4 presents distribution
of storms when we excluded IND storms from analyses.

Analyses of data in Figures 1 and 4 allows us to compare number of each type of solar
wind streams and number of magnetic storms induced by these types of streams and to
calculate probability (geoeffectiveness) of generation of magnetic storms by each types
of these interplanetary drivers (see Table 2). Though the statistics of annual numbers
of solar wind streams is small, the available data speak in favour of suggestion that
geoeffectiveness does not change essentially during solar cycle.

3.3. Efficiency of interplanetary drivers

One of important problems of connection between interplanetary conditions and mag-
netospheric processes is the dependence of magnetospheric activity on temporal evolution
