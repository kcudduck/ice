YERMOLAEV ET AL... GEOEFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY X-7
according to the results of analysis of 64 intense (Dst < —85 nT) magnetic storms in
the period 1997-2002, the average time delay between Dst peak and southward IME Bz
component is equal to ~ 2 h [Gonzalez and Echer, 2005|. Similar results were obtained
in papers by Yermolaev et al. |2007a, c|. Thus, two hours correspond to the average time
delay between the Dst peak of an intense magnetic storm and the associated peak in the
southward IMF Bz component.

In order to investigate the dynamic relation between development of parameters in
interplanetary sources and in the magnetospheric indices we apply the method of double
superposed epoch analysis (DSEA) | Yermolaev et al., 2010c, d|. Two reference times are
used in this method: we put together the time of storm onset (time ”0”) and time of
Dst index minimum (time 76”), the data between them we compress or expand in such
a way that durations of the main phases of all magnetic storms is equal to each other.
This DSEA method allows us to simultaneously study interplanetary conditions resulting
in the beginning and end of magnetic storms as well as dynamics (temporal variations) of
parameters during main phase for storms with different durations.

3. Results

Obtained results are presented in 3 subsections devoted to ( 1) observational statistics
of various types of solar wind streams, (2) probability of magnetic storm generation by
these interplanetary drivers, and (3) efficiency of magnetic storm generation by various
drivers.
