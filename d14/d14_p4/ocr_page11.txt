for different drivers. Efficiency for Kp and AF indices is higher for CIR and Sheath than
for MC and Ejecta.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The quantity of Sun's energy flowing in a magnetosphere and causing magnetospheric
disturbances, is defined by following processes and relations:

1. relative occurrence rate of disturbed types of solar wind streams (interplanetary
drivers of magnetic storms),

2. typical values of plasma and field parameters in these types of streams,

3. probability in magnetic storm generation (geoeffectiveness) for these drivers (i.e.
probability of occurrence of southward IMF Bz component in these drivers), and

4. efficiency of physical process of magnetic storm generation for various drives.

On the basis of OMNI data during 1976-2000 we estimated and compared these pro-
cesses and relations.

The results of our identification of solar wind streams were partially compared with
tabulated data of various events presented on the websites http://star.mpae.gwdg.de/,
http: //lempfi.gsfc.nasa.gov/, and with the ISTP Solar Wind Catalog on the website
http: //www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/scripts/sw-cat /Catalog- events.html. and presented in pa-
pers by Cane and Richardson [2003]; Alves et al. [2006]; Koskinen and Huttunen [2006];
Echer et al. [2006]; Zhang et al. [2007]. This comparison showed a good agreement in more
than 90% of events. It is important to note that, unlike numerous papers where solar wind
identifications were made for selection of only one or two stream types we realized this
approach with a single set of criteria to eight large-scale stream types. The obtained sta-
