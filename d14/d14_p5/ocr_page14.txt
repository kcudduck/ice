changes, variations, and growth in both E and GIC values. Moreover, the consistency in time of these changes

was very high, the extreme values of modelled E for various locations, and GIC appeared at practically the same

time, unlike Event I.

In summary, it seems that GICs associated with different processes (expansion of electrojets or intense
magnetic pulsations) are also associated with a different picture of the temporal-spatial change of the E-field.

Moreover, the performed analysis underlines the important role of both the magnitude and direction
of the E-field in understanding of the appearance of significant GICs, suggested in various studies'**’. The
overestimation of modeled GICs, besides the potential reasons mentioned above, could be the effect of changes in
geoelectric field directions with respect to the Mantsala pipeline or/and the existence of preferential orientations
relative to the pipeline that subsequently drove large GICs™.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the scientific community has recently observed an increase in intense
space weather incidents of a strength exceeding the analyzed strong geomagnetic storm of April 23-24, 2023.
Therefore, our current and future work will focus on modeling the E-field during these new events, particularly
the geomagnetic storm that occurred in May 2024. A comparative analysis of the results of this article with the
spatial-temporal distribution of the geoelectric field during other events can shed light on understanding GICs
and their relationship to physical processes.
