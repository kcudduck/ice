Figure 7. (top) GICs at Mantsala (black, legend on the left) and the SML index (red, legend on the right)
around Event I. Three intervals/times are denoted by red circles, marked as (a-c). (middle) E magnitude
maps corresponding to (a-c). (bottom) E direction maps corresponding to (a—c). Color bars at the right
show E magnitudes (mV km!) in log scale. Black dots on maps indicate geographic location of the IMAGE
magnetometer stations (see Table 1) used for this analysis. For comparison, the Mantsala station location has
also been denoted and highlighted by a red dot.
the maximum value of 991.4 mV km exactly at the same time. The animation S1 displays that after 19:30 UT, E
around MEK is directed towards East. Moreover, Fig. 3 and animation S1 reveal an interesting temporal feature
of the April 23-24 storm as follows. The more south the magnetometer is located (e.g., NUR and TAR, both
operated by Finnish Meteorological Institute), the associated E-field values were stronger during Event I in
comparison to Event 11.

Event | was chosen deliberately, as an example where the power of changes in the values of the geomagnetic
indices and GIC is weaker compared to Event II (Figs. 7 and 8, middle and lower panels). This is the moment
when during the substorm phase the local maximum of the SML-index value appeared. These lower values
indicate that it is expected that the changes in the E-field maps will be more subtle — and this is exactly what
they are.

Event Il at 03:54:20 UT on April 24

The second animation of maps included in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Video S2) presents

the temporal and spatial variations of computed E-field around Event II, from 03:52 to 04:02 UT on April 24.
