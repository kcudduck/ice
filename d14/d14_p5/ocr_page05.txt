Figure 2. Solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) during the intense storm of April, 2023.
From top to bottom, the panels show: (a) solar wind proton speed V/,, (b) Alfvén Mach number Mj, the
horizontal dashed line indicating M4 = 1, (c) proton density NV, (black, legend on the left) and ram pressure
Py (red, legend on the right), (d) proton temperature 7, (black, legend on the left) and plasma-5 (red, legend
on the right), (e) IMF magnitude By, By, By and B, components, (f) the geomagnetic SYM-H index
(black, legend on the left) and the auroral SML index (red, legend on the right), (g) geomagnetically induced
current (GIC) at the Mantsila during April 23-25. The black vertical dashed line shows a fast-forward (FF)
interplanetary shock. The red vertical dotted lines indicate selected GIC events. The red bar at the top indicates
an interplanetary sheath. The green bar at the top and the vertical gray shading both indicate a magnetic cloud
(MC). The light-cyan shading inside the MC shows a sub-Alfvénic solar wind interval with M, < 1. This
figure is adapted from Hajra et al.>>.

Inside the MC, low NN, lead to low Alfvén Mach number Mj of ~ 0.5 at ~12:48 UT on April 24 (Fig. 2b).
The ~ 2.1-h long (from ~12:25 UT to ~14:33 UT on April 24, marked by a light-cyan shading) sub-Alfvénic
(My < 1) solar wind corresponds to the recovery phase of the magnetic storm, and did not cause any
significant geomagnetic storm ring current enhancement. However, the sub-Alfvénic interval is associated with
disappearance of auroral substorms (Fig. 2f).

The near-Earth solar wind data (Fig. 2a-e) described above represent the interplanetary counterpart of a
coronal mass ejection (CME) or an interplanetary-CME (ICME). The fast CME ejected with a linear speed of
~ 1284 km s~! from the Sun (source location: 22° S latitude, 11° W longitude) at ~18:12 UT on April 21. It was
associated with an M1.7 X-ray flare erupted (at ~17:44 UT) from the solar active region AR3282.

Figure 2g presents the GIC measurements at a gas pipeline near Mantsild, Finland (60.6° N geographic
latitude, 25.2° E geographic longitude). It shows several strong GICs. In particular, there are several intervals on
April 23, where the GIC peaks (|GIC|) were > 20 A, e.g., from 19:03:40 to 19:04:00 UT (27.32 A), from 19:04:40
to 19:04:50 UT (25.75 A), from 19:31:40 to 19:32:40 UT (27.17 A), from 19:38:20 to 19:38:40 UT (22.72 A), from
19:39:40 to 19:40:00 UT (22.25 A), from 19:45:20 to 19:45:50 UT (21.73 A), and at 20:04:20 UT (20.65 A). The
maximum value of GIC on April 23 (27.32 A) was registered at 19:03:50 UT. On April 24, GIC peaks > 20 A were
observed from 03:52:50 to 03:53:40 UT (20.82 A), from 03:56:00 to 03:57:00 UT (35.22 A), and from 03:57:30 to
04:00:00 UT (34.18 A), with the strongest values (~ —35 A) at 03:56:40 and 03:58:40 UT. From these multiple
GIC activities, we have selected two events for further systematic studies: GIC peak = 13.97 A at 19:44:00 UT
on April 23 (Event I), and GIC peak = 18.25 A at 03:54:20 UT on April 24 (Event II). These are marked by red
vertical dotted lines in Fig. 2. They correspond to an intense substorm (with the SML peak of —1570 nT at ~
19:45 UT on April 23), and the SSS (with the SML peak of —2760 nT at ~03:54 UT on April 24), respectively.
According to Despirak et al.%, Event I is a part of local nighttime GICs consistent with a poleward expansion
of the substorm-related westward electrojet currents, while Event 2 occurring during local morning sector was
suggested to be led by Ps6 magnetic pulsations caused by a high-density solar wind. Thus the events are suitable
selections to understand the E-field dynamics dependence on varying local times and interplanetary conditions.
Temporal and spatial variability of geoelectric field
Figure 3 shows the magnitudes of the computed E-fields F' = \/E% + E% between 12:00 UT on April 23 and
12:00 UT on April 24 for five selected stations: SOL, DOB, UPS, NUR, and TAR. These stations are located at
