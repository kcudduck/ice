Figure 9. GICs measured (red) and modeled based on the E-field (black) along the Finnish natural gas
pipeline at the Méntséla station. Event I and Event II are marked by red vertical dashed lines.

Thus, Event II was related to the local substorm-like intensification with intense magnetic pulsations in the
IMAGE magnetometers as well as at magnetometers located in the Siberia, the Urals and in the Karelia regions**.
Despirak at al.** suggested that “such local substorm-like intensifications may be caused by solar wind pressure
pulses such as interplanetary shocks>” and plasma parcels®*”.

GIC estimation

Estimating the E-field induced at the Earth's surface is essential for the analysis of GICs. There are various
approaches to the GIC modeling, taking into account the non-uniform lateral conductivity distribution”. To
properly estimate GICs, many factors must be taken into account, such as the strength of the geomagnetic
field disturbance, surface impedance, and network topology'*. In this work, based on the determined E values
over MAN, the GIC modeling with a 10-second resolution was performed using a simple formula for laterally
uniform conductivity distribution: GIC = a - Ex + b - Ey, where Fx, and Ey are the local E-field components.
Values of a and b are conditioned by the power grid parameters: the resistances or the network topology*". For
Mintsild, we used a = —70.0 Akm Vand b = 88.0 A km V~'2°, The same values of of a and b were recently
