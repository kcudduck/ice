In the present work, we will use a large number of high time resolution magnetometer data from the
International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE; http://space.fmi.fi/image/) network to compute
E-field maps for northern Europe to study the stormtime dynamics. The prepared maps will allow systematic
studies of the spatio-temporal evolution of E-fields (their magnitudes and directions) and their relationships to
the interplanetary conditions. The deduced E-fields will then be used for the reconstruction of GICs at Mantsala
(Geomagnetic latitude: 57.29° N, longitude: 102.05° E; Geographic latitude: 60.6° N, longitude: 25.2° E*>~%7),
situated in the sub-auroral region. Constructions of the E-field maps in northern Europe could support the
determination of GICs in selected locations not covered by magnetometers and provide a basis for comparison
with similar events®. This study will be helpful to understand the GIC variability during the superstorms and to
assess the impacts of the superstorms.

Data and methods

Estimation of geoelectric fields

The E-fields are computed from the geomagnetic fields B measured by 29 magnetometers distributed over
northern Europe (from 47.14° to 66.64° geomagnetic latitudes; from 51.45° to 69.76° geographic latitudes), which
are parts of the IMAGE network. We considered data from the stations with suitable conductivity/resistivity
models and data resolution of 10 seconds. Table 1 lists details of the stations, their geographic latitudes and
longitudes, their Corrected Geomagnetic Coordinates (CGM), and the conductivity/resistivity model numbers.
The method is briefly described below.

The perturbed B-field is assumed to be a vertically incident plane wave at the Earth's surface (plane wave
method) and simplified models are applied for the Earths resistivity/conductivity *®*°. While the Earth's
conductivity o varies in all directions, the most-significant variation is assumed to be with the depth’.

The Earth is represented by a 1D layered model*””’, in the frame of which N layers are specified, each defined
by its own conductivity o,, and thickness [,, (n = 1, ..., IV). Then, layered case of the transfer function K (in the
frequency domain f) is expressed by the following recursive formula”:
