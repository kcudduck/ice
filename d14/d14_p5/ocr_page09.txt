Figure 6. Geomagnetic field components Bx (a) and By (b) measured during the April 23, 2023 storm event
(from 16:00 to 23:00 UT) at selected stations: MAS, IVA, SOD, RAN, OU]J, MEK and HAN. The dashed vertical
black line is the shock arrival time (~ 17:35 UT), the Event I is represented by a red dashed line.
Event | at 19:44:00 UT on April 23
Figure 7 shows the computed E magnitude and direction maps at three time intervals during Event I. The
measured GICs at Méntsdla and SML index are shown at the top for context. The three intervals of maps are
shown, marked by red circles in the top panel.

At 19:38:40 UT, the E-field structures are found to move roughly from West-North to South (Fig 7a, middle
and lower panels). In the most parts of the map, the direction of the field is from West to East. Changes occur
mostly at the edges of the map. Some of these changes may not necessarily be a physical effect, but a numerical
one.

At 19:44:00 UT, the moment with extreme SML value, the highest values of E-field were observed near the
Arctic Circle, as well as around the Norwegian magnetometer in Dombés (Fig. 7b, middle and lower panels).
One can also observe, that moving structures were inhomogeneous during that time, e.g., E around Polish
station in Suwatki was stronger than in much more northern locations.

At 19:45:30 UT, i.e., after the time when SML index reached its local minimum, the image of the electric
field in the northern end of the analyzed area began to become significantly distorted (Fig. 7c, middle and lower
panels).

As reported by Despirak et al.**, GIC increases occurred during a substorm, with a poleward development of
the westward electrojet. At that time the GIC measured at Mantsala was 13.97 A, although the local maximum
was at 19:03:50 UT, with the value of 27.32 A. It can be noted that it perfectly matches the time of the largest
increase that can be observed in the changes of the computed E-field, for Nurmijarvi (Fig. 3d). The estimated
value of E is 793.7 mV km’. One may also observe, that the peak value of the E field in the vicinity of Event I
occurred at different times at different stations. This is in contrast to Event II, whose peak occurred at the same
time at all observatories (Fig. 3).

Other, continuously available measurements of GICs are more east comparing to Méntséla. Around Event I,
measurements at Vykhodnoy station (VKH, 68.83°N, 33.08°E), showed that at approximately 17:30 UT (around
the time of the first substorm onset, compare with Fig. 2 in Despirak et al.**) there was the first strong oscillation
in the GIC values, between ~ +20 and —30 A. Another peak was observed just after 20:00 UT with a value
exceeding 25 A. It can be noted that the E-field computed for the magnetometer located at similar geographic
latitude in Masi (MAS, Table 1, Fig. 4a), reached the maximum value of 915.7 mV km! at the same time, i.e.
around the second substorm onset (see Fig. 2 in Despirak et al.?*). Our animation included in the Supplementary
Information (Supplementary Video S1) shows that before 20:00 UT, the direction of the computed E for MAS
changes its direction from South-West to North. The highest values on April 23 were recorded after 20:00 UT.
GIC ranged between almost 40 A and —40 A. Looking more South, GIC data from Kondopoga (KND, 62.22°
N, 34.36°E, Polar Geophysical Institute) show less rapid changes on April 23, with the highest value of ~ 15 A,
around 19:30 UT. Figure 4f shows that E at a similar geographic latitude, Mekrijarvi (MEK, see Table 1) reached
