In this work, to perform analysis of data from 29 stations located at different latitudes and longitudes, we applied
various 1D Earth resistivity models (EURHOM 1D) dedicated to the European region, as listed in Table 1 and
described in details in Addm et al.*>. These models vary in the number of layers, values of thicknesses (I), and
resistivities (1/0), and correspond to local conditions around the observatory stations.

The Earth's internal structure can exhibit a complex 3D distribution of electrical resistivity. Various studies’
have shown, however, that a 1D model remains a valuable first-order approximation for modeling the general
resistivity structure and its impact on surface electric fields. Additionally, the 1D model is both fast and accurate
at a specific location®, which is relevant for this study.

The choice and application of a given Earth resistivity model influences the transfer function K between the
B- and E-fields. In the primary step of the E-field estimation, the geomagnetic field { Bx, By} is decomposed into
its frequency components { Bx(f), By(f)}. Then, they are multiplied by the corresponding transfer function
values, that is

Ex(f) = K(f)By(f) ”
Ey(f) = —K(f)Bx(f),
where Fx(f) and Ey(f) stand for the E-field frequency components. In the final step, the inverse Fourier
transform is applied to determine the E-field values in the time domain [E(f)] for the northward [Ex] and
eastward [Ey| components”.
GeoElectric Dynamic Mapping

GeoElectric Dynamic Mapping (GEDMap)® provides a robust construction of spatial maps of E-fields and
allows determination of very rapid and strong variability of E-fields, and thus the extremely localized peak
enhancements. More precisely, (i) the GEDMap procedure keeps the time resolution of input E-field time series;
(ii) it applies 1D layered conductivity Earth models and determines E-fields at the positions of the magnetometers;
(iii) it allows to select one of the four mathematical methods of 2D interpolation (the nearest neighbor, the linear
interpolation, the cubic spline interpolation®® and the natural neighbor interpolation”); (iv) it constructs E
maps with a grid of 0.05° (latitude) x0.2° (longitude) spatial scale resolution. The final output of the GEDMap
procedure state maps, which presents the magnitude of the modeled E-field E = \/FE% + EZ or both local
direction and the magnitude of E-field®. It should be noted that the selection of interpolation methods in the
preparation of E-field maps is an important step, and should be validated each time when a new space weather
