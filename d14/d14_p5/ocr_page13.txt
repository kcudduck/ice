used in the GIC computations®'>* showing that the modelled values of the largest GICs amplitudes, as well as
their timing match well with the GICs measured in Méntsala.

Figure 9 shows the measured (red) and reproduced (black) GIC values in Méntsala. The correlation coefficient
between these two quantities, determined for period from 16:00 UT to 23:00 UT on April 23 (Fig. 9a) is ~ 0.73
. As can be seen from Fig. 9a, the modeled GIC values present two strong peaks before Event I (marked by
a vertical red dashed line). More precisely, the first peak reflects the intensification in the E-field, right after
19:03 UT, as seen in Figs. 3 and 4 and discussed above. However, the value of modeled GIC is much higher
(~ 50 A) than the measured GIC (~ 27 A). In the light of the discussion by Oliveira et al.””, it worth underlying
that the moment of appearance of this GIC > 20 A is ~ 1.5 h after the interplanetary shock (Fig. 2, dashed
vertical line). The second peak observed in the modeled GIC (~ —30 A) around 19:32 UT, is not consistent with
the measured value.

For time interval from 00:00 UT to 08:00 UT on April 24 (Fig. 9b), which contains strong Event II, the
correlation between the measured and reproduced GICs is ~ 0.76, and in general presents better agreement than
for Event I. Moreover, beside a strong change before 4:00 UT, GIC values are variable but without significant
separate peaks presented in Fig. 9a. This observation seems to be in the agreement with the E analysis performed
in previous sections.

Figure 9c, which is an enlarged part of Fig. 9b, shows, however, that the modeled GIC values (with a
maximum value of ~ 60 A) are significantly higher than the measured GICs just before Event II between ~
3:50 and ~3:54 UT on April 24. For comparison, Despirack et al.** reported very strong GICs at VKH (~ 45 A)
at ~3:30-3:50 UT. Cordell et al."* showed even higher GICs between ~2:00 and ~3:00 UT on April 24, ~ 118
A at Ellerslie substation (53.43° N, —113.46° W) and 63.0 A at Keephills (53.45° N, —114.45° W), located in
Canada. A systematic analysis of subsequent moments of the GIC time series in Fig. 9b does not indicate similar
discrepancies.

It is worth noting that by applying the same GEDMap procedure, we reproduced the GICs in Méntsala during
the geomagnetic storm of September 7-8, 2017, with a much better accuracy®. This raises a question about the
reasons for the observed discrepancy for the present storm. Strong and rapid variations in the direction of the
E-fields, as well as the influence of network parameters a and b on the level of the GICs, could lead to potential
GIC overestimation. Additionally, the slow degradation of the measurement system in Mantsala, as recently
suggested by Kruglyakov et al.”®, could be another explanation. Finally, various studies have confirmed the
usefulness of the 1-D conductivity model in GICs modeling from geomagnetic data*”®". In particular, Dimmock
et al.”’ showed the lack of significant lateral ground conductivity gradients at Mantsila, thus justifying the use
of 1-D models at that location. Moreover, Dimmock et al.*’ carried out 3-D geoelctric field and GIC modeling
in the Fennoscandian region for the September 7-8, 2017 geomagnetic storm. The authors, based on the E-field
values simulated in the SMAP and by using the network parameters a and b taken from Pulkkinen et al.*°
and considered in this work, performed GIC modeling at Mantséla. Their results showed that the modeled
GIC values needed be scaled by a factor of 4 to correspond to the GIC measured at Miéntsala (see Fig. 12c¢
in Dimmock et al.*). Marshalko et al.®! performed 3-D ground E-field modeling in Fennoscandia for three
days of the Halloween geomagnetic storm (October 29-31, 2003) using a 3-D conductivity model of the region
and three three different approaches to source approximation. Their calculations of GIC, based on the E-field
simulated at Mantsila, overestimated the measured values by a factor of 4-6 for all modeling techniques and
finally the scaling procedure of modeled GICs by a factor of 4.51 has been applied (see Fig. 10a—c in Marshalko
et al.°"). One can speculate that the application of a similar 3-D conductivity model for the April 23-24 storm
may lead to comparable overestimation effects in E-field modeling. However, a comprehensive and independent
analysis is needed. On the other hand, applying an appropriate scaling factor or using other rapidly developing
approaches in 3-D geoelectric field modeling seems to be a promising way to address the discrepancies observed
between measured and modeled GIC during the April 23-24 storm?

Summary and discussion

In the present study, we focused on the analysis of the geoelectric field E over the European region during the
severe geomagnetic storm on April 23-24, 2023. By applying various 1-D Earth resistivity models (EURHOM
1D) and using geomagnetic data from 29 stations located across a wide range of latitudes and longitudes, we
calculated the E-field, which is crucial for analyzing GICs. The E-field mapping was prepared using GEDMap
procedure/code. Two separate events (Event I at 19:44:00 UT on April 23 and Event II at 03:54:20 UT on April
24) were examined. Our results showed that:

o The very high modeled values of E-field for the European region were identified on April 24, at stations SOL,

DOB with the E peaks of ~ 1800 mV km! (at SOL) and ~ 3000 mV km (at DOB).

The E-field exhibited strong longitudinal and magnetic latitudinal variability during the geomagnetic storm.

« The model results indicate that significant E-field disturbances may also occur at lower magnetic latitudes,
well below the auroral zone (e.g. the computed |E| for Oulujirvi was 1425.14 mV km" at 19:30 UT, while for
the more northern magnetometer in Masi it was much lower value, namely 915.7 mV km").

« The E-field direction changed from east to westward in Event II. At the same time the GIC values at Mantsala
also reversed, with the positive values before the Event II and negative at the recovery phase.

« Event II was associated with the local substorm-like intensification with intense magnetic pulsations in the

IMAGE magnetometers as well as at magnetometers located in Siberia, the Urals and in the Karelia region“.
Moreover, in the light of the thorough analysis of specific events (Event I and Event II), a few noteworthy
additional observations can be made. During the Event I the highest values of E-field were observed near the
Arctic Circle at the moment when the extreme value of SML index was reached. Event II showed more significant
