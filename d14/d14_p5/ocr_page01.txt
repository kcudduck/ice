We present a study on the dynamical variations of geoelectric fields E during the intense geomagnetic
storm of April 23-24, 2023. The storm is caused by the interplanetary counterpart of a coronal mass
ejection erupted from the Sun in association with an M1.7 X-ray flare. The GeoElectric Dynamic
Mapping (GEDMap) code is applied to develop spatial E maps using magnetometer data from 29
observatories distributed across northern Europe. The code has been applied during local nighttime
and morningtime intense substorms which occurred during the storm main phase. The maps show
intensifications and strong variability of the E-fields during the substorm events. In particular, the
morningtime event is associated with a significant variability in the E-field direction. Using the
computed E-fields, we determined geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) at the sub-auroral
station Mantsala. The modeled GIC values exhibit significant correlation (correlation coefficients
r = 0.73 — 0.76) with the observed values. The performed E-field mapping provides a basis for the
further determination of GICs in selected locations not covered by magnetometers and can be useful in
understanding the GIC variability during magnetic storms and substorms.

The purpose of this work is to develop maps of the geoelectric field E of the north European region during the
intense geomagnetic storm of April 23-24, 2023. Intense geomagnetic storms are caused by solar transients
characterized by high-speed plasma and southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) component B,.
Magnetic reconnection’ between B, and northward magnetopause geomagnetic fields leads to injection of solar
wind kinetic energy into the magnetosphere. This in turn causes global-scale disturbances of the geomagnetic
fields, known as geomagnetic storms™°. In particular, rapid changes in the geomagnetic fields induce local small-
scale geoelectric fields. Close to the auroral zone (~ 65° to 70° magnetic latitude), E-fields have been shown
to be related to the auroral electrojet movements/intensification, Pi5 pulsations and field-aligned precipitation
events’~'", In some locations, E-fields can be dependent on the Earth's conductivity and its variations''~'*. One
of the most important consequences of exceptional high levels of E-fields is the occurrences of geomagnetically
induced currents (GICs)'>~'%, GICs are particularly dangerous for ground-based electrical infrastructures and
the possibility of grid failures'”~*!.

The April 23-24, 2023 storm with a peak SYM-H of —233 nT is the second strongest storm of the current
solar cycle (starting during December 2019) prior to the more recent May 10-11, 2024 superstorm (SYM-H peak
= —518 nT)?“ It is also comparable in strength with the strongest storm of previous solar cycle 24 (with SYM-H
= —234 nT on March 17-18, 2015). Hajra et al.>’ presented a detailed study on the solar and interplanetary
causes of the April 23-24, 2023 storm. A recent study by Despirak et al.** reported strong GICs in north-west
Russian and south Finnish regions during both local morning and nighttime sectors during the storm. During
the peak phase of this storm, GIC monitoring equipment installed at five transformer substations in Canada
indicated GICs up to 117 A, as reported by Cordell et al.'*. They proposed the first DC-equivalent network
model for the Alberta province electric system with modeled GIC values. The largest computed values of E-field,
for that region, appeared between 02:30 UT and 07:20 UT of April, 24, being at the level of 300 mV km "4,
