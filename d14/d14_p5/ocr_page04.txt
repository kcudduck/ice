event with a varying number of high time resolution magnetic field data is considered®. Therefore, during the
analysis of real data recorded by a station at a specific location, the data were compared with an interpolated
value calculated for the same location, but excluding that station from the set of known data points during the
interpolation. Figure 1 shows the correlation values between E measured at 19 of the 29 stations listed in Table
1 (indicated on the x-axis) and those interpolated using nearest neighbor (green line), linear (blue line), cubic
spline (black line), and natural neighbor interpolation (red line). The correlation was calculated using 10-second
resolution data from 12:00 UT on April 23 to 12:00 UT on April 24, 2023. Moreover, 19 stations considered as
verification points and indicated on x-axis have been ordered with decreasing geographic latitudes (Table 1).

Figure 1 reveals the varying levels of effectiveness among the interpolation methods, which directly depend
on the specific stations considered. Verification of interpolation quality has been performed by regression
analysis between the time series measured in a given station and the time series interpolated for the same
location. In this procedure, interpolation was performed with excluding the subject station from the data set. The
lowest correlation coeflicient between the measured and interpolated E values occurs when the nearest neighbor
interpolation method is used (green line) with the mean correlation coefficient of 0.79. For the other three
methods, the mean correlation is above 0.80 (linear: 0.87, cubic spline: 0.86, and natural neighbor: 0.89), and in
general is close to 0.90 for first 10 stations located at higher geographic latitudes, from 69.46° (MAS) to 64.94°
(RVK) (from 66.18° to 62.23° magnetic latitude). When latitudes decrease, the correlations decrease (sparsely
distributed magnetometers), while the lowest correlations are observed for the UPS station. It is noteworthy that
the distance to the nearest station for UPS is the greatest, around 440 km.

As suggested by Fig. 1, the natural neighbor interpolation method (red line) appears to be the most effective,
showing the highest correlation between the measured and interpolated E values for most of the considered
stations. It worth adding that the same interpolation method has been applied by Wawrzaszek et al.® to study the
September 7-8, 2017 geomagnetic storm”®*’*!. Moreover, the natural neighbor interpolation does not require
any statistical assumptions and parameters, it produces a continuous surface without discontinuities, and is
suitable for small datasets®. Therefore, the natural neighbor method has been applied in this present work.

High-resolution (1-min) near-Earth solar-wind plasma and IMF data analyzed in this work are taken from
NASAs OMNIWeb (https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Substorm activity is studied using the Super MAG SML
index (https://supermag.jhuapl.edu/)*>**, GICs at Mantséld are collected from the Finnish Meteorological
Institute (https://space.fmi.fi/gic/).

Results

Solar and geomagnetic conditions

The near-Earth solar wind, interplanetary and geomagnetic conditions during April 23-25, 2023 are shown
in Fig. 2. A gradual decrease in the geomagnetic SYM-H index from a value of ~ 0 nT at 09:00 UT on April
23 marks the geomagnetic storm main phase onset (Fig. 2f). It is preceded by a southward turning of IMF
B, component at ~07:54 UT (Fig. 2e). This is followed by an almost steady southward IMF component B; of
~ 11 nT.

Bg further intensifiesto ~ 25nT at ~19:13 UT on April 23 during an interplanetary sheath (compressed plasma
and IMFs*>*%; marked by a red horizontal bar at the top) by impingement of an interplanetary discontinuity at
~17:35 UT (marked by a dashed vertical line). The discontinuity is characterized by sharp and simultaneous
increases in the solar wind proton speed V}, (~ 358 to ~ 495 km s™ 1, Fig. 2a), density N,, (~ 5.7 to ~ 16.7 cm™?,
Fig. 2¢), ram pressure Fy, (~ 1.2 to ~ 8.0 nPa, Fig. 2c), temperature 7, (~ 1.7 x 10* to ~ 25.2 x 10* K, Fig. 2d,
black), and IMF magnitude Bj, (~ 10.3 to ~ 25.2 nT, Fig. 2e). From an analysis of high-resolution plasma and
IMF data collected by the Wind spacecraft through the mixed-mode discontinuity normal analysis*’ and the
application of the Rankine-Hugoniot**~" conservation laws, the discontinuity (identified at 16:58 UT at the
spacecraft location, ~ 200 Earth radii upstream from the center of the Earth) is found to be a fast-forward (FF)
shock with a magnetosonic Mach number M,,, of ~ 2.7, moving at a speed Vy, of ~ 247 km s~! (relative to the
upstream solar wind) at an angle fg of ~ 81° with respect to the ambient IMF~°.

Following this quasi-perpendicular shock, the sheath By caused a major decrease in the SYM-H index to
—179 nT at 21:59 UT on April 23. This first storm main phase development is associated with multiple intense
substorms, as indicated by the auroral SML index peaks of —1311 nT (~11:21 UT), —1213 nT (~16:46 UT),
—1406 nT (~17:48 UT), —1608 nT (~18:45 UT), —1570 nT (~19:45 UT), —2018 nT (~20:20 UT), and —1660 nT
(~21:37 UT on April 23) (Fig. 2f). The northward turning of IMF at ~21:03 UT (on April 23) resulted in
significant reduction in substorm occurrences.

The interplanetary sheath is followed by a classical interplanetary flux-rope magnetic cloud (MC!)
structure from ~01:17 UT up to ~22:11 UT on April 24 (marked by a green bar at the top and a vertical gray
shading). A sharp north-to-southward turning in IMF B, (with simultaneous polarity changes in By and By) is
followed by slow and smooth polarity rotations in the IMF components and slowly decreasing IMF B (Fig. 2e).
The MC is characterized by a rarefied density (IV, ~ 0.2 — 2.6 cm?) and cold (T}, ~ 1.5 x 10* K) plasma with
low 3 (~ 0.01). The MC has a south-to-north magnetic component configuration, with a peak B; of ~ 33 nT
at ~01:21 UT on April 24. This Bj led to the major second-step development of the storm main phase, SYM-H
reaching —233 nT at 04:03 UT on April 24 (Fig. 2f). This SYM-H peak is associated with a supersubstorm (SSS,
defined by an SML peak < —2500 nT~*"°) with an SML peak of —2760 nT (~03:54 UT on April 24). Thus, the
double-peak storm main phase is attributed to a combined effect of an interplanetary sheath and an MC. The
sheath and MC Bj; components cause magnetic reconnection’ with the Earth's (dayside) northward magnetic
field, leading to the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms (see empirical
verification of this mechanism for substorms by Tsurutani and Meng", and for magnetic storms by Tsurutani
et al.*® and Echer et al.*). The storm gradually recovered to a “quiet” value of —41 nT at 22:44 UT on April 24.
