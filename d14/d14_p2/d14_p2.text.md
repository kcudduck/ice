Received 2005 September 14; in original form 2005 June 1  A B S T R A C T  Torsional Alfv´ en waves are likely excited with bursts in rotating magnetars. These waves are probably propagated through corotating atmospheres toward a vacuum exterior. We have studied the physical effects of the azimuthal wavenumber and the characteristic height of the plasma medium on wave transmission. In this work, explicit calculations were carried out based on the three-layered cylindrical model. We found that the coupling strength between the internal shear and the external Alfv´ en modes is drastically enhanced, when resonance occurs in the corotating plasma cavity. The spatial structure of the electromagnetic fields in the resonance cavity is also investigated when Alfv´ en waves exhibit resonance.  Key words:   stars: magnetic fields – stars: neutron – gamma-rays: bursts.  1   I N T RO D U C T I O N  Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are known as strongly magnetized neutron stars, ‘magne- tars’. The hallmark of these objects is to repeat X-ray or gamma-ray emissions irregularly. So far, four or five known active objects which show frequent X-ray emission of tremendously energetic and shorter initial bursts (typically   E      10   41   erg and    t   ∼   0.5 s) have been iden- tified with SGRs (Thompson & Duncan 2001). Some of these oc- casionally exhibit more energetic events. The giant flare 1900 + 14, now associated with SGR 0525 − 66, was observed in 1979 (Mazets, Golenetskii & Gur’yan 1979b) for the first time and became ac- tive again in 1992 (Kouveliotou et al. 1993) and also in 1998 (Kouveliotou et al. 1998; Hurley et al. 1999a, 1999b). Recently, the intense gamma-ray flare from SGR 1806 − 20, which occurred on 2004 December 27, was reported (Hurley et al. 2005; Mereghetti et al. 2005; Palmer et al. 2005). Rea et al. (2005) have investigated the pulse profile and flare spectrum of SGR 1806–20. Their study may potentially give information about the global field structure in the magnetosphere and may further promote theoretical magnetar models. Their extreme peak luminosity extends up to 10   6   L   Edd   esti- mated at a distance of 10 kpc (Mazets et al. 1999; Feroci, Duncan & Thompson 2001). Typical X-ray luminosities of SGRs have been measured to be   L   x   =   10 34   –10 36   erg s − 1   (Hurley et al. 2000; Thompson et al. 2000), except with giant bursts SGRs 1900 + 14 and 1806 − 20. Shorter durations of initial flares of SGRs are compara- ble to the Alfv´ en crossing time of the core. The energy distribution shows good agreement with the Gutenberg–Lichter law, which may indicate statistical similarity to earthquakes or solar flares (Cheng   E-mail: okita@hirax7.hepl.hiroshima-u.ac.jp (TO); kojima@theo.phys. sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp (YK) et al. 1996; G¨ ogus et al. 1999, 2000). The SGRs have spin periods in a small range of   P   =   5–8 s with rapid spin-down rate ˙ P      10 − 10   ss − 1   , which therefore give characteristic ages   P /   ˙ P   ∼   10 3   yr (Mazets et al. 1979a; Kouveliotou et al. 1998; Hurley et al. 1999a). On the other hand, the physical nature of AXPs is still uncertain due to poor observations, but there seem to be some similarities and differences between SGRs and AXPs. AXPs are energetic sources of pulsed X-ray emission, whose periods lie in a narrow range   P   =   6– 12 s, characteristic ages   P /   ˙ P   =   3   ×   10   3   ∼   4   ×   10 5   yr and X-ray lu- minosities   L   x   =   5   ×   10   34   –10 36   erg s − 1   (Mereghetti 2002; Thompson & Duncan 2001). AXP sources likely have somewhat larger active ages and some of them have softer X-ray spectra compared with SGRs. One of the primary differences between them will be that AXPs so far have shown only quiescent X-ray emission with no bright active bursts such as giant flares. The active ages of SGRs and AXPs are consistent with the observed evidence that these com- pact objects often give their location close to the edge of shell-type supernova remnants. Neither SGRs nor AXPs show the presence of conspicuous counterparts at other wavelengths (Mereghetti & Stella 1995; Mereghetti et al. 2002). The origin of these enormous ener- getics is likely to be their strong magnetic fields   B   =   10   14   –10 15   G estimated by their spin periods and spin-down rates. Only the mag- netar model has been able to account for the enigmatic properties of a rare class of SGRs or AXPs. Shear and Alfv´ enic waves play an essential role on the energy transfer to the exterior in the burst-like phenomena observed in SGRs or giant flares. The Alfv´ en wave propagation in such a strongly mag- netized star should be clarified theoretically. In our previous work, the propagation and transmission of torsional Alfv´ en waves have been studied, focused only on the fundamental mode of azimuthal wavenumber   m   =   1 as a first step. In that work, the exterior of the star is examined qualitatively only, assuming two extreme cases: (i) corotating together with the star and (ii) static state independent C ©   2005 The Authors.

The former will come true when the plasma gas is trapped by closed magnetic field lines, and the latter will be realized without any other force. In any case, it might be inadequate at least in the following two points to place such strong constraints on the wave mode and on ambient circumstances of the star in the previous paper. First, under more realistic situations various modes with azimuthal wavenumber   m      1 are probably triggered by star- quake. Secondly, it is natural to assume that a scaleheight of the plasma gas is neither   L   =   0 nor   L   → ∞ , but has a finite value of   L . Huang, Dai & Lu (1998) pointed out that a relativistic fireball like those in classical GRBs may exist in SGRs. Recently, Thompson & Duncan (2001) have also suggested that after the initial hard spike emission, some lumps of hot plasma gas involving electron–positron pairs and high-energy photons, that is, a fireball, would be created on closed magnetic field lines. In fact, the fast decline and complete evaporation on X-ray light curve observed in the August 27 burst provides clear evidence of the trapped fireball. Motivated by this, we thus extend our study to include some plasma gas spreading over the stellar surface. The main aim of this paper is to study the physical behaviour of the torsional Alfv´ en waves with azimuthal wavenumber   m   in the presence of corotating plasma confined within a certain finite distance   L , and then to investigate the effects of these quantities  m   and   L   on the wave propagation and transmission. In Section 2, our model is self-consistently constructed and the relevant basic equations are formulated. These equations are almost the same as those derived in Kojima & Okita (2004), but are summarized here for the paper to be self-contained. In Section 3, we derive the dispersion relation in a Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) way to show that the rotating plasma atmosphere plays a crucial role as a resonant cavity of the wave when a certain condition holds. In Section 4, transmission rates of the Alfv´ en waves are numerically calculated. In Section 5, their electromagnetic field structure is also discussed with the numerical results. In Section 6, we give a brief summary of our findings and their implications for the torsional Alfv´ en waves on rotating magnetars.  2   E L E C T RO M AG N E T I C S O N ROTAT I N G M AG N E TA R S 2.1 Model  Both the magnetic field and the rotation of a star lead to a compli- cated geometrical configuration. In this paper we assume some sim- plified conditions to understand the physical processes of the wave propagation. We here consider a three-layered cylindrical model with radius    pc   . It is composed of the neutron star crust between  z   = − q   and   z   =   0 (region 1), corotating plasma above the stellar surface between   z   =   0 and   z   =   L   (region 2) and static pure vacuum at   z   >   L   (region 3) as shown in Fig. 1. The plasma gas filled in the atmosphere corotates with the crust at the same angular velocity    . Local magnetic fields permeate uniformly in each layer and point along the   z -direction,   B   =   B   o e z   , which represents open magnetic fields extending to infinity. Alfv´ en waves excited at the bottom of the crust   q   ≈   10 5   cm, owing to some mechanisms, travel upward along the local magnetic field lines. They are partially reflected and transmitted at the boundaries  z   =   0 and   z   =   L , where the physical property of Alfv´ en waves sig- nificantly changes because of the effect of the background rotation, as shown below. This model, by setting   L   → ∞ , reduces to the case in which the plasma gas extends infinitely to the exterior of the star, while setting   L   →   0 reduces to the simple case in which the exterior  Figure 1.   Three-layered cylindrical model. Region (1) corresponds to the rotating neutron star crust with a constant angular velocity    , region (2) corresponds to the fireball as a resonant cavity filled with plasma corotating with    , and region (3) denotes a static pure vacuum. is filled with pure vacuum only. Up to the present time, we have no observational information of the plasma size   L . In this work,   L   is regarded as a free parameter in order to investigate its effect on the wave propagation and transmission. We now give some comments on the validity of this model by comparing the physical sizes    pc   ,   q   and   L   with the stellar radius   R . In this model we have explicitly assumed that the local magnetic field has a   z -component only. Our model can be applied to the polar cap region, whose cylindrical radius    pc   is given by    pc   =   R   sin   θ   pc   ≈  10   4   ( T   / 1   s ) − 1 / 2   cm      R   =   10 6   cm. Curvature of the stellar surface and the magnetic field lines may be neglected within the polar cap region. In a similar way, it may be valid to assume that the local magnetic field lines are uniform if the thickness of each layer is smaller than the star radius,   L ,   q      R . We can also extend our model to the extreme case   L   ∼   R . Even in this case, the validity of this model nevertheless holds good near the   z -axis. In the remainder of this paper we restrict our explicit calculations only to the axially symmetric small region within the polar cap radius, unless otherwise stated.  2.2 Linear perturbation  In this section, we consider the propagation of torsional shear- Alfv´ en waves with various azimuthal modes on rotating magnetars. Such waves are probably excited by the turbulent motion of the starquake in the deep crust, but above the neutron drip ( z   >   z nd   ≈ − 10   5   cm). Many proposals for the starquake model have been put forward (e.g. Pacini & Ruderman 1974), but all of them are generally argued only for weakly magnetized neutron stars with 10   11   –10 12   G. Therefore, their treatments are inadequate for magnetars, as they are. However, an analogous mechanism may also occur in magnetars. In this paper, we do not discuss the triggering mechanism of the star- quake itself, but focus only on the process by which electromagnetic shear waves, once generated, are propagated and transmitted from the deep crust, through a magnetized plasma, toward the vacuum exterior. We assume that the horizontal Lagrange displacement   ξ   =   ( ξ      ,  ξ   φ   , 0) is suddenly shaken in the deep interior at depth   q   ≈   10 5   cm; nevertheless, the matter remains immobile in the vertical direction C ©   2005 The Authors.

Torsional Alfv´ en waves in rotating magnetars   881 due to strong gravity of the neutron star,   g   ∼   10   14   cm s − 2   . Therefore, the following transverse wave condition may be easily satisfied:  ∇   ·   ξ   =   1    ∂ ∂    (  ξ    )   +   1    ∂ ξ   φ  ∂ φ   =   0 .   (1) As one of the simplest solutions, wave Ansatz under this condition can be written formally as  ξ ( , φ,   z ,   t )   =   ( e    ±   i e φ   )  (     pc  ) m − 1  ξ ± m ,ω   ( z ) e − i( ω t ∓ m φ ) ( m   =   1 ,   2 ,   3   . . . ) .   (2) Here, the notation ‘ ± ’ denotes the difference of helicity states. Dis- placements and other perturbed quantities are always assumed to have a harmonic time dependency e − i ω t   . The crust and the surrounding plasma can be regarded as a per- fect conductor because ohmic dissipation time-scales are very long compared with other time-scales of interest. The frozen condition can read  E   +   1  c   v   ×   B   =   0 .   (3) The background is assumed to rotate uniformly with   v   =     e φ   , which means that the local electric field around a highly conducting spherical star has only a radial component   E   =   ( −   B   o / c ) e    . The electric field now generates the Goldreich–Julian charge density  ρ e   = ∇   · E   / 4 π   = −  B o / 2 π c .   (4) Transverse displacements of the crustal matter produce electro- magnetic field perturbations propagating along the local magnetic field   B   =   B   o e z   . A self-consistent set of Maxwell equations for per- turbed electromagnetic fields   δ E   and   δ B   are  ∇   ·   δ   E   =   4 π δρ e ,   (5)  ∇   ·   δ   B   =   0 ,   (6)  ∇   ×   δ   E   = −   1  c   ∂ t   δ   B ,   (7)  ∇   ×   δ   B   =   4 π  c   δ   j   +   1  c   ∂ t   δ   E ,   (8) where   δ   denotes Eulerian perturbation. By taking the perturbation of equation (3) and then combining with equation (7),   δ E   and   δ B  are expressed as  δ   E   = −   1  c   ( δ v   ×   B   +   v   ×   δ   B )   ,   (9)  δ   B   =   ( B   ·   ∇ )   ξ .   (10) By using the relation between the displacement and the velocity perturbation   δ v   =   ∂ t   ξ   +   ( v   ·   ∇ )   ξ   −   ( ξ   ·   ∇ )   v   together with equa- tion (2), we obtain  δ   E   =   B o  c  (     pc  ) m − 1  ×  [  ∓   ( ω   ∓   m  )   ξ ± ( e    ±   i e φ   )   +      d ξ ±  d z   e z  ]  ×   e − i( ω t ∓ m φ ) ,   (11)  δ   B   =   B o  (     pc  ) m − 1   d ξ ±  d z   ( e    ±   i e φ   ) e − i( ω t ∓ m φ ) .   (12) Equations (11) and (12) imply that if stellar rotation can be com- pletely ignored, then   δ E ,   δ B   and the propagation vector   k   =   k e z   form a mutually orthogonal set of vectors, say, transverse electromagnetic modes (TEM). However, in the presence of rotation, such an orthog- onality breaks down and thus longitudinal modes of the perturbed electric fields and currents are excited [transverse magnetic (TM) modes]. Other perturbed quantities related to the displacement are calculated by using above the results (11) and (12):  δ   j   =   c  4 π   ∇   ×   δ   B   −   1 4 π   ∂ t   δ   E  = ∓ i   cB o 4 π  (     pc  ) m − 1   { [   d 2 ξ ±  d z 2   +   ω   ( ω   ∓   m  )  c 2   ξ ±  ]  ×   ( e    ±   i e φ   )   ∓   ω  c 2 d ξ ±  d z   e z  }  e − i( ω t ∓ m φ ) ,   (13)  δρ e   =   1 4 π   ∇   ·   δ   E  =   B o ω  4 π c  (     pc  ) m − 1   d 2 ξ ±  d z 2   e − i( ω t ∓ m φ ) .   (14) The linearized equation of motion for uniformly rotating back- ground from a static equilibrium state governing the torsional Alfv´ en waves is now given by  ρ [ ∂ t   δv i   +   ( v   ·   ∇ )   δv i   +   ( δ   v   ·   ∇ )   v i   ]  =   δ S i   +   δ   F i   +   ( g δρ ) i   −   ( ∇ δ   p ) i   ( i   =   , φ,   z ) .   (15) The profile of the mass density   ρ   in the crust is obtained by solving the equation of state for degenerate electrons as follows (Blaes et al. 1989)  ρ   =   ( μ e m u   )   5 / 2 3 π 2   ¯ h 3  (   g 2 μ e m u  c 2   z 2   +   2 gm e   | z |  ) 3 / 2  ≈   8 . 0   ×   10  [ (   | z |  cm  )  +   2 . 5   ×   10 − 4  (   | z |  cm  ) 2 ] 3 / 2 g cm − 3 ,   (16) where   m   u   is an atomic mass unit,   μ e   is the mean molecular weight per electron and the other symbols have their usual physical meanings. The first term on the right-hand side of equation (15),   δ S i , is a perturbed elastic stress tensor associated with distorted matter in the crust and can be written in terms of   ξ δ S i   = ∇   j  [(  κ   −   2 μ  3  )  δ i j   ∇   ·   ξ  ]  + ∇   j  [  μ  (   ∂ ξ   i  ∂ x   j  +   ∂ ξ   j  ∂ x   i  )]  ( i ,   j   =   , φ,   z ) ,   (17) where   κ   is a bulk modulus,   μ   is a shear modulus given by  μ   =   0 . 295 Z   2 e 2 n 4 / 3  i  ≈   4 . 8   ×   10   27  (   ρ  10 11   g cm − 3  ) 4 / 3 erg cm − 3 ,   (18) with the ion number density   n   i   =   ρ/ Z   μ e   m u , and   δ i j   is the Kronecker delta. In the following calculations,   Z   =   32 will be adopted as a typical value in the crust. If one considers the complete transverse oscillation mode, the first term of equation (17) vanishes owing to  ∇   ·   ξ   =   0. The second term on the right-hand side of equation (15) can be resolved into perturbations of Lorentz and Coulomb forces  δ   F   =   δρ e   E +   ρ e δ   E +   1  c   ( δ   j   ×   B   +   j × δ   B )     1  c   ( δ   j −   ρ e δ v )   × B .

882   T. Okita and Y. Kojima  Here we used equation (9) and unperturbed current   j   =   ρ   e v   indu- ced by the background rotation. We further dropped the term   δρ   e   E   ∝  (  / c )   2   , which is small near the   z -axis or within the actual stellar radius   R . Eliminating   δ j   with the help of equation (8), the electro- magnetic force reduces to  δ   F      1 4 π   ( B   ·   ∇ )   2   ξ   −   B 2 o 4 π c 2   ∂ t   δ v .   (20) The first term in equation (20) implies the tension of the perturbed magnetic field, while the second term shows the magnetic pressure generated by the distorted matter. The last two terms of equation (15) represent gravitational force ( g δρ ) i   and pressure gradient ( ∇ δ   p ) i   , respectively. However, unless one takes the p- or f-mode such as compressional waves and/or sonic waves into consideration, one can ignore them for simplicity in this model.  2.3 Wave equation  We now derive the wave equation in region (1) shown in Fig. 1. Substituting equations (17) and (20) into equation of motion (15), we can obtain the following differential wave equation in terms of the displacement   ξ   (1)  ±  d 2 ξ   (1)  ±  d z 2   +   1  ˜ μ  d ˜ μ  d z  d ξ   (1)  ±  d z   +   ˜ ρ  ˜ μ  σ ± × { σ ±   ±   [ m (1   −   h )   +   2]    }   ξ   (1)  ±   =   0 ,   (21) where   ˜ μ   and   ˜ ρ   denote the effective shear modulus and the effective mass density defined as  ˜ μ   =   μ   +   B 2 o 4 π   ,   (22)  ˜ ρ   =   ρ   +   B 2 o 4 π c 2   .   (23) The ratio of these quantities gives the shear-Alfv´ en wave speed in the crust   ˜ v   =   √ ˜ μ/ ˜ ρ . In the above expression, the frequency   σ ±   ≡   ω   ∓  m    measured in the corotating frame for each helicity state has been introduced. We can limit this frequency to the positive regime   σ ±  >   0 for the symmetry   ξ ± m , − ω   =   ξ   ∗ ∓ m ,ω   . The dimensionless function  h   in equation (21) is formally defined as  h   ≡   4 π ρ c 2 4 π ρ c 2   +   B 2 o  ,   (24) which has a great influence on the dispersion relation of the wave especially with large   m   not only in the inner surface, but also in the rotating plasma cloud, as discussed in the following section. Note that if one considers the static background (    =   0), wave equa- tion (21) coincides with that already derived by Blaes et al. (1989). We now look for a WKB solution. In the deep interior, the solution of wave equation (21) can be well asymptotically given by  ξ   asymp  ±   ≈ | z | β   [ A ±   exp {− i[ ψ ± ( z )   +   ω t ] } +   B ±   exp { i[ ψ ± ( z )   −   ω t ] } ] ,   (25) with   β   = − 7 / 4. Here   ψ   ± ( z ) denotes eikonals defined as  ψ ± ( z )   ≡  ∫   z  − q  d z ′ √ σ ±   { σ ±   ±   [ m   (1   −   h )   +   2]    }  ˜ v   ,   (26) for each mode. The first and second terms in equation (25) repre- sent the upward-propagating Alfv´ en wave with a complex incident amplitude   A ±   and a downward-propagating wave with a complex reflection amplitude   B   ±   bounced at the stellar surface, respectively. We now turn to the wave behaviour in region (2) (0   <   z   <   L ). Mass density in this region is so small that one can formally take the limit   h   →   0. Thus equation (21) reduces to d   2 ξ   (2)  ±  d z 2   +   1  c 2   σ ±   [ σ ±   ±   ( m   +   2)  ]   ξ   (2)  ±   =   0 .   (27) The solution of this equation can be analytically written as  ξ   (2)  ±   =   C ±   exp { i [ k (2)  ±   z   −   ω t ]}   +   D ±   exp {   −   i [ k (2)  ±   z   +   ω t ]} ,   (28) where the wavenumber   k (2)  ±   with each mode in the plasma is defined as  k (2)  ±   ≡   1  c  √ σ ±   [ σ ±   ±   ( m   +   2)  ] .   (29) In region (3) with pure vacuum ( z   >   L ), the wave equation be- comes d   2 ξ   (3) d z 2   +   ω 2  c 2   ξ   (3)   =   0 .   (30) Owing to the absence of rotating matter, two helical states satisfy the same equation. We here dropped the notation ‘ ± ’. The solution is easily given by  ξ   (3)   =   E   exp { i [ k (3)   z   −   ω t ]} .   (31) The wavenumber thus takes an ordinal form as  k (3)   ≡   ω  c   .   (32) In the above expressions,   C   ± ,   D ±   and   E   are complex incidence, reflection and transmission amplitudes in each region, respectively. These wave amplitudes and the wavenumbers determine the trans- mission rate of the wave based on some boundary conditions. A mathematical treatment is given in Section 2.4.  2.4 Boundary condition  The physical property of Alfv´ en waves changes at the bottom and at the top of the rotating plasma layer, depending on the azimuthal wavenumber and the angular velocity of the background. We now require boundary conditions in the usual way in order to connect each wave solution continuously. From equations (28) and (31), the continuity at the upper surface of the plasma,   z   =   L , gives  C ±   =   E  k (2)  ±   +   k (3) 2 k (2)  ±  exp { − i [ k (2)  ±   −   k (3) ] L }   ,   (33)  D ±   =   E  k (2)  ±   −   k (3) 2 k (2)  ±  exp { i [ k (2)  ±   +   k (3) ] L }   .   (34) Substituting equations (33) and (34) into equation (28) and then taking the derivative at the stellar surface, we obtain d d z   ln [ ξ   (2)  ±  ] ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z = 0  =   i k (2)  ±   γ ,   (35) where   γ   is a modification quantity due to background rotation of the surrounding plasma defined as  γ   =   κ +   exp ( − i κ −   L )   −   κ −   exp (i κ +   L )  κ +   exp ( − i κ −   L )   +   κ −   exp (i κ +   L )   ,  with  κ +   =   k (2)  ±   +   k (3) ,   (36)  κ −   =   k (2)  ±   −   k (3) .

Torsional Alfv´ en waves in rotating magnetars   883 A detailed treatment and the physical meaning of   γ   are given in Appendix A. In order to solve wave equation (21), we consider the complex linear combination   ζ   =   ζ   1   +   i ζ 2   with specific solutions   ζ   1   and   ζ   2 to be satisfied with equation (35). At the ends, we can obtain the explicit boundary condition at the stellar surface   z   =   0 d d z   ln ( ζ 1   +   i ζ 2   )  ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z = 0  = − k (2)  ±   [ ζ 1   (0)  γ   +   ζ 2   (0)  γ   ]  +   i k (2)  ±   [ ζ 1   (0)  γ   −   ζ 2   (0)  γ   ]   .   (38) The logarithmic derivative of the asymptotic solution has to be equal to that of numerical solution in the deep interior   z      0, so that we request d d z   ln ( ξ   asymp  ±  ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z =− q  =   d d z   ln ( ζ   )  ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ z =− q  .   (39) This yields  B ±  A ± =   [ β | z |   − 1   +   i(d ψ ± / d z )] ζ   +   (d ζ / d z ) [ − β | z |   − 1   +   i(d ψ ± / d z )] ζ   −   (d ζ / d z )  exp( − 2i ψ ± ) .   (40) Finally, the reflection   R ±   and transmission coefficients   T ±   of the waves with each helicity propagating from the crust through the plasma toward the vacuum exterior are respectively expressed as  R ±   =  | B ±   | 2  | A ±   | 2   ,   (41)  T ±   =   k (3)  k (1)  ± | E | 2  | A ±   | 2   =   1   −   R ± .   (42)  3   P RO PAG AT I O N 3.1 Dispersion relation  In this section, the behaviour of the torsional Alfv´ en waves is dis- cussed based on the dispersion relations. Eikonal equation (26) de- pends on the depth through the functions   h   and   ˜ v . For strong mag- netic fields   B   o      10 14   G considered in this paper, it can be shown that   ψ   ±   in equation (26) varies weakly with the depth except for the inner region close to the star surface. The local dispersion relation can be approximately written as  k ±   ≈   1  ˜ v  √ σ ±   { σ ±   ±   [ m (1   −   h )   +   2]    } .   (43) This relation can also be obtained by taking a short wavelength limit, namely, the high-frequency limit. The dimensionless function  h   involved in equation (43) varies from   h   =   1 in the deep interior to  h   =   0 in the surface and exterior. This function represents the ratio between the rest-mass energy density and the effective magnetic energy density. For   h   =   1, the rest-mass energy dominates over the magnetic energy. This case corresponds to the classical limit. On the other hand, strong magnetic energy   B   o      10 14   G easily overwhelms the rest-mass energy of the electrons or ions in the low-density region, where   h      0. In this case, relativistic displacement current should be included in the analysis. In order to investigate the propagation property of the wave, it is useful to define the phase velocity   v p   in a straightforward manner as  v 2 p  / c 2   =   ω 2 /   ( ck ± ) 2   ,   (44) which is also related to the refraction index   N   ±   =   c /v p   for each mode. Note that   v 2 p   is not necessarily positive. It is well known in plasma physics (e.g. Wolfgang & Rudolf 1996) that waves are in general reflected at the cut-off points where   N   ±   →   0, and are ab- sorbed at the resonant absorption points where   N   ±   → ∞ . Since the frequency   σ ±   in the rotating frame is here confined within the positive regime   σ ±   >   0,   k   +   is always real, that is, neither cut-off nor resonant absorption points appear in the positive helicity. On the other hand, there are both absorption and cut-off points for the neg- ative mode. In the remainder of this section, our attention will thus be paid only to this mode for physical interests. The dispersion rela- tions with negative mode are schematically shown for the classical limit in Fig. 2 and for the relativistic limit in Fig. 3, respectively. In both diagrams, the region   v 2 p / c 2   <   0 stands for the non-propagation, i.e. the evanescent zone. The vertical dotted line denotes the cut-off frequency of the wave. (i) Classical limit. As seen in Fig. 2, the evanescent zone appears only in the low frequency and narrow-band width 0   < σ − / <  2. In this classical treatment, the cut-off of the wave appears at  σ − /   =   2, which can be physically interpreted as the fact that the Coriolis force interrupts the wave propagation in the rotating frame. In a high-frequency region   σ − / >   2, waves are almost capable of propagating except for   σ − /   =   m , at which waves are strongly absorbed by resonance with a rotating background. This is because refractivity diverges in this particular frequency. It is noticed that  Figure 2.   Dispersion relation for negative helicity waves with   m      3 in a classical limit,   h   →   1. The region below the horizontal axis corresponds to the evanescent zone. The vertical dotted line denotes the cut-off frequency  σ − /   =   2. The resonant absorption frequency is given by   σ − /   =   2.  Figure 3.   Same as Fig. 2 in a relativistic limit,   h   →   0. The cut-off frequency is   σ − /   =   m   +   2.

884   T. Okita and Y. Kojima  such a resonant absorption frequency   σ −   =   m    in our model is formally analogous to the electron–cyclotron resonant frequency in the standard plasma physics (Wolfgang & Rudolf 1996). (ii) Relativistic limit. It is important to understand the new effect that appears in the relativistic case. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the evanescent zone prevails in the frequency regime 0   < σ − / <  m   +   2, whose band width is therefore broadened by large   m   modes. The cut-off frequency is given by   σ − /   =   m   +   2. It is only a high- frequency wave with   σ − / >   m   +   2 that can always propagate in a WKB sense. By contrast with the classical limit, the resonant absorption   σ − /   =   m   does not appear in this propagation regime, but in the evanescent regime.  3.2 Structure of the potential barrier  As is obvious from Fig. 3, evanescency cannot be neglected in large  m   mode. In this subsection, we turn to the investigation of the spatial structure in the evanescent zone for large   m . We now introduce a new dependent variable      −   defined by    −   ≡   ˜ μ 1 / 2 ξ −   for the amplitude of the negative mode with   ˜ z   ≡  √ σ −   z . Exploiting some arithmetic algebra, wave equation (21) is now rewritten into a Sturm–Liouville- type differential equation d   2  −  d ˜ z 2   +  [  1 4 ˜ μ 2  (   d ˜ μ  d ˜ z  ) 2  −   1 2 ˜ μ  d 2   ˜ μ  d ˜ z 2   +   1  ˜ v 2   ( ˜ E   −   ˜ V m   )  ]   −   =   0 ,  (45) where  ˜ E   =   σ − ,   (46)  ˜ V m   =   [ m   (1   −   h )   +   2]   .   (47) The first two terms concerning   ˜ μ   in square brackets in equa- tion (45) become very small for strong magnetic fields   B   o   >   10   14   G, since   ˜ μ   can be almost regarded as a constant. We can compare equation (45) with the one-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation for the box-type potential in a stationary state. Physical quantities   ˜ E  and   ˜ V m   , respectively, correspond to ‘wave energy’ and ‘potential’ in a formal sense. Strictly, the potential   ˜ V m   depends on the wave energy   ˜ E   through the frequency   σ − . However,   σ −   is here treated as a constant value irrespective of the position, so that the following discussion is valid without loss of generality. A schematic profile of the effective potential   ˜ V m   and the wave energy   ˜ E   is given in Fig. 4 as a function of distance   z . We draw the  Figure 4.   Spatial structure of the potential barrier for the negative mode as a function of distance. The horizontal dotted line denotes rotation frequency  σ −   of the wave propagating above the potential. curve in region (1) somewhat exaggeratedly. The potential varies with the position through the function   h   and the background rota- tion    . The potential height is determined by the coupled quantity ( m   +   2)      and its width is given by the size   L   of the corotating zone. This result means that the large wavenumber lifts up the po- tential barrier, only if the background stellar medium rotates. In other words, if the surrounding matter is not dragged by the star, say, being in static state      =   0, then the potential never rises, even though some high azimuthal waves exist. Whether or not the wave can propagate and transmit out depends on the wave energy, that is, wave frequency   σ − . Our argument deserves to be specially emphasized in two explicit regimes: the evanescent frequency mode 2  < σ −   <   ( m   +   2)    and the propa- gation mode   σ −   >   ( m   +   2)  .  3.2.1 Evanescent mode:   2  < σ −   <   ( m   +   2)   As is apparent in Fig. 4, such low-frequency waves excited in the interior cannot help striking the potential barrier. Since refractivity is zero on the critical curve   σ − /   =   m (1   −   h )   +   2, outgoing waves with   m (1   −   h )   +   2   < σ − / <   m   +   2 are generally reflected, when they reach the potential wall.  3.2.2 Propagation mode:   σ −   >   ( m   +   2)   In this case, perturbation of the electromagnetic fields can propa- gate as a wave. The present context in our model is almost con- cerned with the WKB frequency range. The propagation sometimes exhibits a remarkable property, if certain conditions are satisfied. As long as the wave frequency is much greater than the poten- tial strength   σ −      ( m   +   2)  , the potential itself does not have much influence on the wave behaviour. However, if the frequency becomes commensurable to the potential height   σ −      ( m   +   2)  , the existence of a potential barrier cannot be ignored. Especially if the wavelength is comparable to the potential width, i.e.   k   −   L   ∼   1, then the waves will interfere with the potential barrier and their be- haviour will be strongly altered. This inherent property is expected to be more evident near the threshold frequency   σ −   ∼   ( m   +   2)  . Motivated by this general consideration, we explicitly calculate the transmission rate in the next section. The numerical parameters are adopted to satisfy the above condition,   L   ∼   1 / k   −   ∼   10 6   cm and   m   =  ω max /   ∼   10 6   . Using these parameters, we examine how and to what extent the propagation and transmission are affected by the potential barrier.  4   T R A N S M I S S I O N 4.1 Numerical calculation  We numerically calculate the transmission rates (42) of the wave propagating from the deep crust, through the corotating plasma en- velope, toward the vacuum exterior subject to matching conditions at each boundaries. As already mentioned above, only the nega- tive helicity wave is intriguing for physical interests. Evanescent modes in a low-frequency regime 0   < σ −   <   [ m (1   −   h )   +   2]      are excluded from this calculation. This constraint on wave frequency thereby guarantees that all waves are capable of propagating in a WKB sense. We can roughly estimate a typical wave frequency  ω   measured in the inertial frame by approximating as   ω   ∼   ˜ v/ q . An appropriate frequency thus lies in a finite range 10   3      ω     10   6   s − 1   . C ©   2005 The Authors.

Torsional Alfv´ en waves in rotating magnetars   885  Figure 5.   Transmission coefficients of the negative helicity wave with the fundamental mode   m   =   1 as a function of frequency when   B   o   =   10 15   G and     =   1 s − 1   . Solid and dotted lines denote the results of   L   =   10   6   and   L   =   0 cm, respectively. The objective of this section is to explore the effects of azimuthal wavenumber   m   and the size   L   of the corotating plasma medium on the wave transmission. We here consider two kinds of specific torsional waves whose azimuthal number is (i) the fundamental,  m   =   1, and (ii) much larger than one,   m   =   ω max /   =   10   6   . In each case, we further consider two apparently different circumstances in the exterior   L   =   R   ∼   λ −   ∼   10 6   cm and in the absence of plasma  L   =   0 cm. Figs 5 and 6 respectively demonstrate the transmission coef- ficients for the negative helicity waves with two extreme cases (i)   m   =   1 and (ii)   m   =   10   6   as a function of the wave frequency measured in the inertial frame when   B   o   =   10 15   G, typical for mag- netars. In both figures, the solid and dotted lines denote the results of   L   =   10   6   and   L   =   0 cm, respectively. The surrounding plasma is here assumed to corotate with the same angular velocity as that of the star,      =   1 s − 1   . In each case, we obtained the following results. (i) Fundamental wavenumber:   m   =   1. As seen in Fig. 5, the trans- mission curve in the case of   L   =   10   6   cm slightly shows a wiggling behaviour. This curve intersects that of   L   =   0 at   ω   ∼   10   4   s − 1   . How- ever, the difference between both cases becomes indistinguishable in the high-frequency regime   ω      10   5   s − 1   , since the wave fre- quency is much higher than the critical one ( m   +   2)      =   3 s − 1   , which appeared as the potential barrier in Section 3. As the wave frequency becomes higher, the transmission rate approaches unity asymptotically. Since the overall property does not depend on   L , the  Figure 6.   Same as in Fig. 5, but for high azimuthal number   m   =   10   6   . In this high   m   mode, the transmission rate is highly enhanced at some selected frequencies due to the plasma envelope. potential barrier due to rotating plasma does not make any signifi- cant influence on the wave transmission for small azimuthal number  m   ∼   1. (ii) Highly azimuthal wavenumber:   m   =   10   6   . In this high   m   mode, we can find some surprising results. Fig. 6 shows that the transmis- sion rate of   L   =   10 6   cm is drastically enhanced at some selected frequencies. More importantly, such enhancements occur periodi- cally at specific frequencies. At the top of the first wing ( n   =   1) ω t   =  2.2   ×   10   3   s − 1   , the rate reaches the maximum   T   max   =   0.71, which corresponds to approximately 70 times larger than that of the first bottom   ω b   =   7.0   ×   10 3   s − 1   . Compared with the   L   =   0 case at the same frequency   ω t   , this maximum   T   max   amounts to 230 times larger. In this way, the plasma effect is important at each top frequency, but unimportant at any bottom frequency. As shown in Fig. 6, the trans- mission coefficient through the plasma layer is exactly equal to that of the   L   =   0 case at arbitrary wing bottom. In general, the rotating plasma has an effect in helping the escape of the waves except for the bottom frequencies. This point is different from that of case (i). In order to understand the transmission enhancement, we have also numerically computed the integral   ∫   T   d ω   in some frequency bands for both   L   =   10 6   and   L   =   0 cm. We obtain some 13 times enhancement in the narrow band 2  < ω < ω b   and 1.4 times in the broad band 2  < ω < ω max   compared to the results of   L   =   0. Such enhancement and periodic variation slowly decrease with increas- ing wave frequency. This property almost vanishes when the fre- quency becomes comparable to the critical frequency ( m   +   2)      ∼  10 6   s − 1   . Periodic enhancements in our numerical calculations can be in- terpreted as a consequence of wave interference within the rotating plasma cavity. In the following subsection, we investigate our results more quantitatively in a simplified analytical method.  4.2 Analytical Calculation  Periodic enhancements on the wave transmission in our model can be satisfactorily rationalized by comparing with the wave propaga- tion in homogeneous multimedia. Non-relativistic Alfv´ en resonance itself in the magnetosphere around the Earth and the Sun has been widely recognized and discussed theoretically and observationally (for recent reviews, see Leonovich & Mazur 1997; Waters 2000; Li & Wang 2001). Hollweg (1983) has theoretically studied WKB wave propagation in three homogeneous layers labelled by (1), (2) and (3) separated at   z   =   0 and   z   =   L   as shown in Fig. 7. In his work Alfv´ en waves are simply assumed to have constant wavenumbers  k (1)   ,   k (2)   and   k (3)   in each region. In this homogeneous model, the transmission coefficient   T   can be analytically calculated by taking  Figure 7.   Three homogeneous models separated by two discontinuities at   z   =   0 and   z   =   L . If the periodic boundary condition   k (2)   L   =   n π   ( n   =   1, 2,   . . . ) holds, the intermediate layer acts as a resonant cavity and transmission is highly enhanced.

(48) Although the physical situation is different from our present work, similar expressions could be found also in our model. This formula (48) implies that the transmission rate has a periodic struc- ture depending on the wavenumber   k (2)   and the characteristic scale  L   of the intermediate layer unless   k (2)   L   ∼   0. Extrema of the trans- mission rate work out to be  T max   =                4 k (1) k (3)  [ k (1)   +   k (3) ] 2   at   k (2)   L   =   n π ,  4 k (1) k (3) / [ k (2) ] 2  {  1   +   k (1) k (3) / [ k (2) ] 2 } 2   at   k (2)   L   =   (2 n   −   1)   π / 2 ,  (49) with   n   =   1, 2,   . . .   . Provided that the wavenumber in each region satisfies the inequalities  k (1)      k (2)      k (3) ,   (50)  k (2)   L      1 ,   (51) the coefficient of cos   2   [ k (2)   L ] in equation (48) becomes dominant compared to that of sin 2   [ k (2)   L ]. In this limit, equation (48) can be well approximated by  T   ≈   4 k (1) k (3)  [ k (1)   +   k (3) ] 2   cos − 2   [ k (2)   L ] .   (52) It is noticed that if   k (1)   ∼   k (2)   ∼   k (3)   , the transmission shows nei- ther periodic variations nor enhancements. Consequently, inequali- ties   (50)   and   (51)   give   a   set   of   resonant   conditions   of   the wave.   Sterling   &   Hollweg   (1984)   have   subsequently   consid- ered   a   three-layer   model   for   a   solar   flare,   which   is   com- posed of a chromosphere, a spicule and a corona. In that work they have confidently suggested the possibility of Alfv´ enic res- onance   on   solar   spicules   and   have   shown   a   new   aspect   of spicules which may account for occasionally twisting motions of magnetic field lines, even when the above resonant conditions ap- proximately hold. Conditions (46) and (47) may hold true also in our model except close to the thin regime beneath the stellar surface, whenever large twisted waves with   m      1 propagate in the rotating background. We can now quantify the particular frequencies at which the wave resonance occurs. By solving the quadratic equation ( σ − ) 2   −   ( m   +  2) σ −   −   [ k (2)  −   ˜ v ] 2   =   0, together with the periodic condition   k (2)  −   L   =  (2 n   −   1) π , the eigenfrequencies of the negative mode are obtained as  ω m , n   =   (2   −   m ) 2      +  √ (   m   +   2 2     ) 2  +  [   (2 n   −   1)   c π  2 L  ] 2  ,   (53) with   m ,   n   =   1, 2, 3,   . . .   . This formula shows that the resonant frequencies depend critically on the azimuthal number   m   and the plasma cavity length   L . They gently decrease with an increase in  L   or   m . Physically, this means that it takes a longer time for the wave to go back and forth between the stellar surface and the top of the plasma layer, and then this wave interferes with another one propagating from the crust into the cavity. In extremal cases, we find lim  L →∞   ω m , n   =   lim  m →∞   ω m , n   =   2 ,   (54) which coincides with the cut-off frequency in the classical limit. At the same time, transmission peaks become blended with neighbour- ing resonance lim  L →∞  ω m   =   lim  m →∞  ω m   =   0 ,   (55) where   ω m   ≡   ω m , n   −   ω m , n − 1   . For      =   1 s − 1   and   L   =   10   6   cm, from equation (53) we can cal- culate some representative resonant frequencies: the fundamental mode frequency   ω 10 6 , 1   =   8 . 8   ×   10 3   s − 1   , the second mode   ω 10 6 , 2   =  7 . 4   ×   10 4   s − 1   and the third   ω 10 6 , 3   =   1 . 9   ×   10 5   s − 1   . Our numerical work also gives similar results;   ω 10 6 , 1   =   2 . 2   ×   10 3   s − 1 , ω 10   6 , 2   =  1 . 9   ×   10   4   s − 1   and   ω 10 6 , 3   =   5 . 2   ×   10   4   s − 1   , respectively. Our re- sults exhibit slightly positive deviations from the analytical results. Recall that the wavenumber   k (1)   in our magnetar model cannot be regarded as a constant, since the mass density drastically changes in the vicinity of the stellar surface. This discrepancy would probably be attributed to the inhomogeneity in the crust. If a sharp bound- ary is formed at the stellar surface, such a difference may probably become small. From a comparison with the analytical model, we have concluded that the transmission enhancements obtained in our model are thought to be a result of the Alfv´ en resonance on the rotating plasma cavity due to the potential barrier.  5   E L E C T RO M AG N E T I C F I E L D S T RU C T U R E  In the preceding section we have elucidated that the transmission rates of waves are highly enhanced at some selected frequencies owing to the resonance effect in the rotating plasma cavity. Reso- nance in the plasma portion has another spectacular nature. In this section, we show that resonance has a great impact not only on the transmission rates, but also on the electromagnetic field structure associated with Alfv´ en waves. Most of our applications will once again concern the WKB frequency regime of the negative helicity  σ −   >   [ m (1   −   h )   +   2]  . Hereafter we omit the subscript ‘ − ’ for simplicity.

The longitudinal component of the perturbed magnetic fields is always zero   δ   B   z   =   0, because the matter has been assumed to be vertically immobile in the present work. On the contrary, only if the background rotates, the electric fields have a longitudinal component whose structure is essentially identical to that of the magnetic fields. Thereby, we only have to investigate the transverse components (    ,   φ ) of the fields. For the sake of exploring the dependence of the azimuthal number  m   on the field structure, we once more restrict our discussions to two kinds of extreme cases: (i) the fundamental mode   m   =   1 and (ii) the large azimuthal wavenumber   m   =   l (  1). In this limit, equa- tions (49) and (50) can be well approximated by  | δ   B    | 2  B 2 o  =  | δ   B φ   | 2  B 2 o  =   1   2    2  | c δ   E   z   | 2  B 2 o  =                  f   m   (    ) k (1)  m   k (3)   T m   | A | 2 for   m   =   1 ,  f   m   (    ) k (1)  m   k (3)  [   k (2)  m k (3)  ] 2  T m   | A | 2   sin   2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L ) for   m   =   l ,   (58) and  | c δ   E    | 2  B 2 o  =  | c δ   E φ   | 2  B 2 o  =                    f   m   (    ) σ   2  m k (1)  m k (3)   T m   | A | 2 for   m   =   1 ,  f   m   (    ) σ   2  m k (1)  m k (3)   T m   | A | 2   cos 2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L ) for   m   =   l .   (59) Here we have dropped some small terms coupled to [ k (3)   ] 2   , since inequality   k (1)  m      k (2)  m      k (3)   holds for large   m . Equations (58) and (59) have the implication that the fields are almost constant for small  m   modes, but are sinusoidally changed with   z   for large   m . In principle, the absolute value of the incident wave amplitude  | A |   cannot be determined in our linearized theory. If we are allowed to assume that   f   m = l   (    ) | A | 2  m = l   ∼   f   m = 1   (    )   | A | 2  m = 1   , then the ratios of electromagnetic field amplitude with   m   =   l   to those with   m   =   1 are approximately given by  | δ   B i   | 2  m = l  | δ   B i   | 2  m = 1  ≈  (  1   +   l  ω  ) 2   (  1   −   2  ω  )   T m = l T m = 1 sin   2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L )   (60) and  | δ   E   i   | 2  m = l  | δ   E   i   | 2  m = 1  ≈  (  1   +   l  ω  ) 3   (  1   +    ω  ) − 2   T m = l T m = 1 cos 2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L )   ,  (61) with   i   =      ,   φ . These quantities are much larger than unity because of the extra factor (1   +   l /ω ) except for some special locations   z   =  n π / k (2)  m   and   z   =   (2 n   −   1) π / 2 k (2)  m   ( m ,   n   =   1, 2,   . . . ), which correspond to the nodes of the standing Alfv´ en wave. We now examine the effect of the resonance in the rotating plasma cavity, whose thickness is given by   L   ∼   R   =   10   6   cm, on the spatial structure of the perturbed electromagnetic fields. Let us designate by   α   the amplitude of the perturbed magnetic field within the plasma normalized by that in the absence of the plasma  α ( z )   ≡  | δ   B i   | 2  L = R  | δ   B i   | 2  L = 0  ≈   T L = R T L = 0  c 2  ω 2  ×  [{  [ k (2)  m   ] 2   −   ω 2  c 2  }  sin   2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L )   +   ω 2  c 2  ]  .   (62) The first term in square brackets is related to the deviation due to high torsional modes in the rotating background from the dispersion relation in a vacuum. The ratio   α   is plotted against the height from the stellar surface for (i)   m   =   1 in Fig. 8 and (ii)   m   =   10 6   in Fig. 9. Solid lines denote the numerical results at the top of the wing   ω t   =  2.2   ×   10 3   s − 1   , while dotted lines denote the bottom   ω b   =   7.0   ×  10 3   s − 1   . The transmission rates at resonant frequencies obtained in Section 3 are appropriately used in this calculation. (i) Fundamental wavenumber:   m   =   1. As shown in Fig. 8, in the case of   m   =   1, the wave amplitude keeps one order of magnitude in the plasma. This result agrees well with the fact that the dispersion relation for small   m   ∼   1 is almost equal to that of the electromagnetic fields in pure vacuum, [ k (2)  m   ] 2   ∼   ω 2 / c 2   . The background rotation therefore does not affect this small   m   mode. (ii) Highly azimuthal wavenumber:   m   =   10   6   . Some significant differences can be found in this high mode. The perturbed magnetic field strength   α   for   m   =   10 6   at the resonant frequency   ω t   is drastically amplified up to   α   ∼   10   5   at   z      10   5   cm. Then the field strength   α  falls down to   α   =   T   L = R   / T   L = 0   ∼   230 at the top of the plasma layer, in which the first node of the standing Alfv´ en wave is formed.

888   T. Okita and Y. Kojima  Figure 9.   Same as in Fig. 8 for   m   =   10   6   . Field amplitudes are drastically and periodically enhanced for large   m . This enlargement is attributed to the resonance transmission and the conservation of energy flux as a multiplier effect. at the bottom frequency   ω b   the strength   α   has about 10   2   at   z      5   ×  10   5   cm. In the same way, the normalized amplitude of the perturbed elec- tric field is expressed by  β ( z )   ≡  | δ   E   i   | 2  L = R  | δ   E   i   | 2  L = 0  =   T L = R T L = 0  (  1   +   m  ω  ) 2   1  [ k (2)  m  ] 2  ×  [{ [ k (2)  m  ] 2  −   ω 2  c 2  }  cos 2   k (2)  m   ( z   −   L )   +   ω 2  c 2  ]  ,   (63) which is plotted in Figs 10 and 11. When   m   =   10   6   , the field am- plitude   β   of   ω t   has almost the same magnitude 10   5   as   α   near the stellar surface   z      10   4   cm. However, near the top of the plasma   z   ∼  10   6   cm, in contrast to   α ,   β   has a maximum 5   ×   10   7   , which corre- sponds to the loops of the standing wave. Approximately,   β   is much greater than   α   because of the extra term (1   +   m /ω ) 2   ∼   10 6   in equation (63). Such a field amplification can also be explained by considering a conservation of energy flux   F   ∼   ˜ ρvω   | ξ   | 2   . The phase velocity   v   of the mode   m      1 in the plasma atmosphere is much smaller than that in the vacuum, as is confirmed in equations (43) and (44). Assuming the same value   | ξ   |   at the stellar surface, which is irrelevant to   L , the  Figure 10.

Same as in Fig. 10 for   m   =   10   6   . amplitude   | ξ   |   ( ∝ v − 1 / 2   ) is enhanced in the rotating plasma region so as to compensate for the slowing down of the wave propagation.  6   S U M M A RY A N D D I S C U S S I O N  We have studied the propagation and transmission of torsional Alfv´ en waves along the rotation axis on magnetars by using a three- layered cylindrical model. If the intermediate plasma layer rotates with angular velocity    , the propagation property for largely twisted waves with   m   > ω/   is drastically modified. This middle zone can be regarded as a kind of a potential barrier, whose height is explic- itly specified by ( m   +   2)  . Waves having an angular velocity of 2   originate from the Coriolis force in the classical limit, while an addi- tional quantity   m    comes from the relativistic effect. This therefore means that the potential is lifted up higher in the large   m   modes on the rotating background. It should be emphasized that this new finding is purely attributed to having incorporated the displacement current into the model. We have numerically computed the transmission rates of the tor- sional waves with a large value   m      1 driven in the crust, through the corotating plasma with a finite size   L   ∼   R , into the exterior. We found that the transmissions are strongly enhanced for large   m   ≈  ω/   at selected wave frequencies satisfied with a periodic condition  kL      (2 n   −   1)   π / 2( n   =   1, 2,   . . . ). Such a transmission enhancement arises because the rotating plasma forms a resonant cavity which traps the wave energy by virtue of the strong reflections occurring at the transition region at the bottom and at the top of the plasma layer. Efficient transmissions due to resonance are also compatible with the fact that the reflection of waves at the stellar surface can al- most completely be extinguished. A magnetospheric waveguide or resonance cavity can thus actually generate a set of coherent eigen- modes for high   m . Resonance may be a signature of fundamental processes by which high-order torsional oscillations of waves, if these exist, can transfer much more energy out of the magnetars especially in the low-frequency regime. It is well known in quantum mechanics that when the potential width is comparable to (or integer times) the de Broglie wavelength of electrons   L   ∼   n   ¯ h / m   e v , incident wave flux is bounded by finely tuning a phase relation with inversely propagating waves (e.g. Schiff 1968). Then resonance is excited in the potential zone and the wave flux spends much of its time in the resonance cavity. Similar reso- nance may occur also in our macroscopic model, if the characteristic scale of the evanescent zone is comparable to the wavelength of the Alfv´ en wave. C ©   2005 The Authors.

Torsional Alfv´ en waves in rotating magnetars   889 We have investigated the spatial structure of the perturbed electro- magnetic fields propagating in the rotating plasma, when standing Alfv´ en waves are formed. Resonance in the plasma cavity for high  m   modes has another spectacular aspect. At some points magnetic fields of the Alfv´ en waves are drastically amplified even up to a few 10   5   times as large as those in the absence of plasma or in the static exterior. This amplification can be straightforwardly explained by both the transmission enhancement due to resonance and the con- servation of WKB energy flux. In this way, once the Alfv´ en waves are resonantly excited and transmissions are greatly enhanced, a substantial part of the wave energy will probably be transferred into the ambient charged par- ticles such as electrons or positrons confined within the fireballs associated with the bursts on magnetars. The charged particles en- twined around magnetic field lines will then be violently swayed. These disturbances may eventually produce high-energy gamma- ray or X-ray emissions from the magnetars. More importantly, if magnetic field lines at some altitudes are strongly distorted from equilibrium state by resonance and plasma fluid contracts into the surface, the field lines with antiparallel components will approach each other. Such geometry of field lines will give rise to possible magnetic reconnection type events as Thompson & Duncan (2001) have suggested. The behaviour of resonant magnetohydrodynamics waves within the corona or spicules erupted from the solar surface has been stud- ied so far. In fact, field line resonance has been found to occur on magnetic shells in the magnetosphere of the Earth. However, their physical treatment is inevitably restricted to the very weak mag- netic fields. The resonant property found in our magnetar model is very similar to that in solar astrophysics or planetary physics. We can expect that the same mechanism works also on the relativistic Alfv´ en waves even in a different environment, that is, in an extreme circumstance accompanied by very strong magnetic fields such as magnetars. As a final remark, we address the angular velocity      of the star and the azimuthal wavenumber   m . In our model, the rotating back- ground is throughout assumed to have a slow angular velocity      =  1 s − 1   , which is actually observed in SGRs and AXPs. We concen- trate our treatment on the torsional waves with a specific value   m   =  10   6   as a possible limit of high   m . As shown in our work, the striking behaviour of the resonance necessarily requires high-order torsional modes,   m   > ω/ (1 s − 1   )      10   3   –10 6   . It is not clear whether or not such modes with high wavenumber   m   realistically exist on the magne- tars. However, one should keep it in mind that the local dispersion relation of the Alfv´ en waves is almost determined by the coupled quantity   m    except for the high-frequency regime. This means that the physical behaviour of the wave with high   m   =   10   3   –10 6   on the slowly rotating background      =   1 s − 1   is essentially equivalent to that of small   m   =   1–10   3   and fast rotation      =   10 3   s − 1   . Neutron stars are often expected to have been a rapid rotator with      ∼  10   3   s − 1   at a star-born period. Our results would thus become much more effective especially on young magnetars.

Imperial College Press, London  A P P E N D I X A : R E S O N A N C E M E C H A N I S M  The physical effects of   γ   can be clarified by taking some explicit limits. Specifically, if we ignore the substantial thickness of the plasma layer   L   →   0, then the wavenumber of region (2) should be replaced with that of region (3),   k (2)  ±   →   k (3)   . This yields that   κ +   →  2 k (3)   ,   κ −   →   0 and   γ   →   1. In this limit, the boundary condition reduces to d / d z [ln   ξ   (2)  ±   ]   =   i k (3)   , which clearly corresponds to the simple case that the exterior of the star is filled with pure vacuum or static plasma gas. While, if we imagine the very huge plasma gas corotating in the exterior and take the limit formally   L   → ∞ , then the wavenumber of region (3) should be equal to that of region (2),  k (3)   →   k (2)  ±   . We thus have that   κ +   →   2 k (2)  ±   ,   κ −   →   0 and   γ   →   1, which yield the boundary condition d / d z [ln   ξ   (2)  ±   ]   =   i k (2)  ±   . We can draw some important facts from the boundary condition (35). Especially when the wavenumber satisfies the periodic condi- tion   κ ±   L   =   n π   ( n   =   1, 2,   . . . ), this yields   γ   =   k (3) / k (2)  ±   and thereby the boundary condition for pure vacuum is recovered d / d z [ln   ξ   (2)  ±   ]   =  i k (3)   . The background rotation has no influence only on the Alfv´ en waves satisfied with this condition. Whereas, when the wavenum- ber satisfies the another periodic condition   κ ±   L   =   (2 n   −   1) π / 2 C ©   2005 The Authors.

Kojima  ( n   =   1, 2,   . . . ), we obtain   γ   =   k (2)  ±   / k (3)   and thus the boundary con- dition works out to be d / d z [ln   ξ   (2)  ±   ]   =   i k (3)   [ k (2)  ±   / k (3)   ] 2      i k (3)   . The right-hand side of this expression turns out that the waves satis- fied with this condition are highly transmitted, as far as   k (1)  ±   does not change much over one wavelength, say the validity of WKB approx- imation (1 / k (1)  ±   )   | d k (1)  ±   / d z |    k (1)  ±   holds. This peculiar result means that the internal shear modes can be coupled on to the high-frequency Alfv´ en modes at the stellar surface, which drastically enhances their transmission rate at certain wavenumbers or frequencies.

- **p.5 (Fig 3.)** Figure 3. Same as Fig. 2 in arelativistic limit, 4 — 0. The cut-off frequency which 1s also related to the refraction index N. = c¢/v, for each is 0_/Q = m + 2. The resonant absorption occurs within an evanescent mode. Note that v2 1s not necessarily positive. It 1s well known 1n regime at o_ /Q2 = m.
