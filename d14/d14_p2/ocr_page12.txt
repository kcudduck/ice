(n=1,2,...), we obtain y = k2/k® and thus the boundary con- that the internal shear modes can be coupled on to the high-frequency

dition works out to be d/dz[In£] = ik® [kP /k®]? > ik®. The Alfvén modes at the stellar surface, which drastically enhances their

right-hand side of this expression turns out that the waves satis- transmission rate at certain wavenumbers or frequencies.

fied with this condition are highly transmitted, as far as KY does not

change much over one wavelength, say the validity of WKB approx-

imation (1/ kD) dk /dz| K KY holds. This peculiar result means This paper has been typeset from a TeX/IATEX file prepared by the author.
