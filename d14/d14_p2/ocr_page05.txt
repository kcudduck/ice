Torsional Alfvén waves in rotating magnetars 883

pends on the depth through the functions 4 and v. For strong mag- ©

that vr 1 1n equation (26) varies weakly with the depth except for the -
inner region close to the star surface. The local dispersion relation Figure 2. Dispersion relation for negative helicity waves with m > 3 in a ®

This relation can also be obtained by taking a short wavelength 2
limit, namely, the high-frequency limit. The dimensionless function =
h involved in equation (43) varies from 2 = 1 in the deep interior to a =
h = 0 1n the surface and exterior. This function represents the ratio = S
between the rest-mass energy density and the effective magnetic 7
energy density. For 4 = 1, the rest-mass energy dominates over the {
magnetic energy. This case corresponds to the classical limit. On the egos I SU
other hand, strong magnetic energy B, > 10'* G easily overwhelms (ub) 2 meee ee
the rest-mass energy of the electrons or ions in the low-density 0 m m+2 m(mt2) o /Q
region, where 2 =~ 0. In this case, relativistic displacement current (m2) B
should be included in the analysis.
In order to investigate the propagation property of the wave, it 1s
useful to define the phase velocity v, in a straightforward manner

mode. Note that v2 1s not necessarily positive. It 1s well known 1n regime at o_ /Q2 = m.
