ABSTRACT 5
Torsional Alfvén waves are likely excited with bursts in rotating magnetars. These waves S
are probably propagated through corotating atmospheres toward a vacuum exterior. We have S
studied the physical effects of the azimuthal wavenumber and the characteristic height of the S
plasma medium on wave transmission. In this work, explicit calculations were carried out =
based on the three-layered cylindrical model. We found that the coupling strength between the a
internal shear and the external Alfvén modes 1s drastically enhanced, when resonance occurs in 2
the corotating plasma cavity. The spatial structure of the electromagnetic fields in the resonance =
cavity 1s also investigated when Alfvén waves exhibit resonance. =
