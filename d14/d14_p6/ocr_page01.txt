iN Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce
- currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause
@\ high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss (CEL).
¢$) Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric
D power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble
a multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the
probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model
ON incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a
global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between —70°
— and 80° geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT
= spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately
= 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years)
@ electricity loss.
