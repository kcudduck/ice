Som Geoelectric field components Ex and Ey for years 2010-2014 calculated using a 1-D
= layered-Earth model (Adam et al., 2012).
We are aware that the induced E field can vary widely even during a given event (Ngwira et al., 2015;
Pulkkinen et al., 2015). Therefore, a quantitative and more detailed analysis of computed geoelectric field £
for selected geomagnetic storms has been performed in the next section.
Here we defined a pivot time based on the Table 1 as the days when there appeared the HMF southward
component By < —=10 nT (case 1), Dst < =100 nT (case 2) and both, B>< -10 nT and Dst < =100 nT (case 3)
during more than 3 h. Next, we extracted subsets of daily data of electrical network failures (of a particular
type) during a whole week around the pivot events, i.e., 3 days before and after each event. Subsequently, we
superposed all extracted subsets of failures synchronizing all zero-days and normalising values to the
average during the whole week being equal to 0. Figures 3-5, panels (a) show that around a pivot event, huge
growth in the EGF in all three groups is observed. To visualise the overall situation during the considered
geomagnetic storms in Figures 3-5, panels (b) we display the temporal behaviour of superposed daily mean
of Dst-index (averaged over the number of events, details in Table 1), panel (c) presents superposed daily
mean of B HMF component changes (averaged over the number of events) and panel (d) depicts superposed
daily mean of computed geoelectric field E = VE% + EZ [mV/km] (details in the Sect. 3.2).

Figure 3 displays case 1 circumstances when B>< -10 nT for more than 3 h. Figure 3, panel (a) presents that
on the zero-day EGF caused by the aging of infrastructure elements (group D) increased to 52% above the
average value during the whole week and rose to 44% above this average on the second day after the pivot
time. The EGF growth connected to the unreliability of electronic devices (group E) on the 0 day was 263%
above the average, on the day after reaching 434% and 193% above the average on the second day. EGF
having unknown reasons (group F) grew from the mean value by 148% on the 0 day.
Figure 4 presents the conditions for the case 2, when Dst < -100 nT remained for more than 3 h. Figure 4,
panel (a) presents that EGF caused by the aging of infrastructure elements (group D) increased to 247%
above the average value during the whole week on the second day after the pivot time. The EGF growth
connected to the unreliability of electronic devices (group E) was 86% on the day after the 0 day and still
growing on the second day after the pivot time to 235% above the average. EGF having unknown reasons
(group F) grew from the mean value by 104% on the 0 day and still being 50% above the average on the day
after.

Figure 5 depicts the situation for the case 3, when B><-10 nT and Dst<-100 nT lasted more than 3 h. Figure
5, panel (a) presents that EGF caused by the aging of infrastructure elements (group D) increased to 152%
above the average value during the whole week on the second day after the pivot time. The EGF growth
connected to the unreliability of electronic devices (group E) also appeared on the second day after the pivot
time, reaching 520% above the average. EGF having unknown reasons (group F) grew from the mean value by
111% on the 0 day.
