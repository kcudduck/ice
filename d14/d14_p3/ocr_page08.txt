during the intense geomagnetic storms with Dst < —=100 nT and Bz < —-10 nT (case 3), for years
2010-2014.
SOM were applied to investigate the impact on the number of electrical grid failures of the selected
heliospheric and geomagnetic data. Twelve parameters were selected for the analysis. Four of them are the
number of electrical grid failures: caused by the aging of the infrastructure elements (group D), electronic
devices (group E), having unknown reasons (group F), and the sum of groups D-F. The remaining 8 are the
following data: strength of HMF B [nT] and its B- [nT] component, solar wind speed SWs [km/s] and proton
density SWd [N/cm?3], as well geomagnetic indices: Dst-index [nT], ap-index [nT], AE-index [nT], K-index.
We considered here the intense geomagnetic storms between January 2010 and July 2014 (case 3 described
in the Sect. 2.1, details in the Table 1). Because of various delays between geomagnetic disturbances and
transmission line failures appearance described in the literature (e.g., Zois, 2013; Gil et al., 2019, 2020a,b;
Svanda et al., 2020), we considered here data sets where EGFs are: zero, one, two, and three days delayed in
relation to the heliospheric and geomagnetic parameters. We compared our results with computations for an
undisturbed period at the beginning of 2010 (control data set).
The above-described data sets with a 3-hour resolution were selected as an input. Various sizes of the map,
the different number of iterations, and the neighborhood distance function were tested. The optimal set of
computations parameters were a 4 x 4 neuron grid, 100 iterations, and the link distance function.
Our analysis showed that the most substantial relationship between the number of failures and considered
heliospheric and geomagnetic data was observed for the data set without delay. Figure 6 presents an
example of our analysis results for the intense geomagnetic storm on 15 July 2012. The SOM neighbor weight
distances describe the weight assigned to the adjacent neurons’ distances, labeled as blue hexagons. The red
lines show which particular neurons are connected and the colors in the areas containing the red lines show
the weight of the connection between neurons. The lighter the color, the shorter the distance between
adjacent neurons. Figure 6 also displays numerical representation of the adjacent neurons’ connection
weights. A weight close to 1 means a shorter distance between neurons and more robust grouping into
clusters in the studied space. The connection weights between neurons close to 0 mean that they are located
far apart in the studied space. The parameters related to these neurons are not correlated with each other.

=] for data without delay for the intense geomagnetic storm, 15 July 2012. The blue hexagons
represent neurons, and the red lines show which particular neurons are connected. Colors from
black to yellow display the weight values of the connection between neighboring neurons.
In Figure 6, the parameters related to the individual neurons are plotted. They represent the distribution of
data in the studied space. The Dst geomagnetic index and B- component of HMF related to the first neuron in
the lower-left corner have been grouped into one cluster located at some distance in the studied space from
the other parameters constituting the second cluster. This means that the Dst and By parameters are
strongly connected, but not so with the others. In the lower-right corner are grouped parameters related to
the number of electrical grid failures caused by aging of the infrastructure elements, group D (eighth neuron
counting from the lower-left corner by rows), failures related to electronic devices, group E (seventh neuron),
failures having unknown reasons, group F (third neuron) and the sum of groups DEF. The proton density is
located near neurons related to the number of electrical grid failures at a distance of 0.82. Additionally, the
geomagnetic ap-index, HMF strength B, and AE-index are located in the upper-right corner, while the solar
wind speed and K-index are located in the upper-left corner. The light color of the connections between the
neurons related to the parameters above proves that the SWd, B, and ap-index parameters significantly
impact the number of electrical grid failures, especially on groups D and E. The AE-index, K-index, and SWs
parameters also impact the occurrence of failures due to the grouping of these parameters in the same
cluster. However, the greater distance from the neurons related to electrical grid failures expresses their
