SOM neighbor weight distances with weight values of connections between neighboring neurons
BE for data without delay for the intense geomagnetic storm, 15 July 2012. The blue hexagons
represent neurons, and the red lines show which particular neurons are connected. Colors from
black to yellow display the weight values of the connection between neighboring neurons.
