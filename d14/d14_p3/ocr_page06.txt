can see that the percentage fraction of EGFs from groups DEF has a rising trend similar to the solar activity
cycle in 2010-2014, represented by yearly changes of sunspot number (visualised by orange squares). DEF's
percentage rate concerning all EGFs changes from (23 + 2)% near the solar minimum in 2010 up to (30 £ 5)%
near solar maximum in 2014.

Next, to compare dBy/dt and failures of transmission line elements caused by selected reasons (groups D, E
and F from Table 2) we applied the t-test (see Sect. 3.1). In our analysis we considered 3 h intervals of dBy/dt
data and failures caused by aging, electronic devices breakdowns, or having an unidentified reasons. We have
taken into account such the geomagnetic events from 2010 to 2014 that max(dBy/df) = 25 nT/min (e.g.
Adebesin et al., 2016) and by the first group of our data, we have set these values of DEF failures, which
observed in times directly after storm events. The second group of the data consisted of the aging, electronic
breakdowns, and unidentified type of failures that occurred immediately before the geomagnetic storm, i.e.,
before the dBy/dt max value was more or equal to 25 nT/min. In this way, we have got the sets of statistical
parameters such as sums, means, medians, standard deviations, coefficient of variations, skewnesses,
kurtosis, etc., in the intervals of time 24, 48, and 72 h. We have denoted them, for example, as mean 24 h- for
a mean of the number of DEF failures that occurred during 24 h before max(dByx/dt) = 25 nT/min and mean
24 h+ for the mean of the number of DEF failures occurred during 24 h after the whole time interval with
max(dBy/dt) = 25 nT/min. Similarly, 48 h— and 48 h+, 72 h—- and 72 h+ work in the same manner and standard
deviations are included alongside the mean. Using Statistica software, we compared the sets of DEF failures
in both intervals of time 24 h— and 24 h+, 48 and 72 h. The summary of the obtained results is given in Tables
3 and Table 4,
Table 3 The analysis of the t-test for means of DEF failures in 2010-2014 for 24 h+, 24 h—, 48 h+, 48 h-,
72 h+ and 72 h-, where Wis the value of Shapiro - Wilk test, Fthe value of Levene test".

48 h+, 48 h—, 72 h+ and 72 h-.
In Tables 3 and 4, the values of: the Shapiro - Wilk test, W, the Levene test, Fand t-test were obtained for our
data by using corresponding formulas. Their values are not as significant as the p-values which are
responsible for accepting or rejecting the Hp hypothesis. In our calculations, we put a = 0.05, for a < p we
accept Hp hypothesis, otherwise, when a > p we reject Hg and accept Hq which is the alternative hypothesis,
moreover, when a < p <0.1 we can also reject Hy and accept Hq. From Tables 3 and 4, we can see that both
assumptions for the t-test are fulfilled if we have 48 h or 72 h intervals. The comparison of means of DEF
failures in 2010-2014 years for 48 h has shown that mean 48 h+ > mean 48 h- (see, mean 48 h+ = 9.17 and
mean 48 h— = 5.91). It was confirmed by the t-test for means of DEF failures for 48 h (t= 2.21 with p = 0.034).
Similarly, we considered the means of DEF failures denoted for 72 h, and we have obtained mean
72 h+ > mean 72 h—- (see, mean 72 h+ = 7.23 and mean 72 h— = 4.31). The t-test gave t= 2.13 with p = 0.04.
Analogically, for standard deviation we obtained SD 48 h+ > SD 48 h—, as well mean 72 h+ > mean 72 h— (see t
= 1.88 with p=0.07 and t= 1.92 with p= 0.06, respectively).
Figure 2 shows the geoelectric field components Ex and Ey calculated based on 5 years measurements of the
geomagnetic field and by applying 1-D layered conductivity Earth model (see Sect. 3.2). One can see Exand Ey
in mMV/km calculated for particular years of 2010-2014. Similar scales on Y-axis allow us to quickly compare
the state of the geoelectric field between considered years. In particular, we see that year 2012 (fifth and
sixth panels of Figure 2) was one of the most variable periods. This is in agreement with information from
Table 1, where the geomagnetic storms have been listed mostly for the year 2012. The more detailed analysis
of Figure 2 reveals the increase of Ex and Ey values in days 69, 114-115, 197-198, 275 of the year 2012.
