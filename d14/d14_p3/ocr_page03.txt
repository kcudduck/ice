Information about failures in power Networks Is sensitive data. Jnerefore, we have access to a limited time
span of data. We analyse here the relation of transmission line (network) failures with heliospheric and
geomagnetic data. What is more, the temporal evolution of geoelectric field estimates are determined using a
1-D layered conductivity model. It has to be underlined that the first computation of geoelectric field for
Poland based on a 1-D layered conductivity model was performed by Viljanen et al. (2014), but for a different
period, namely years 1996-2008 (solar cycle 23). Our results reveal growth in the number of transmission
network failures during and right after considered classes of geomagnetic storms. This allows us to speculate
about the sensitivity of electrical power grids in Poland to solar activity conditions and to underline the
importance of further studies on this topic.
2 Data
We considered here data characterising the overall situation near and on the Earth in 2010-2014. Special
attention was paid to data of Bz component of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) and Dst-index, with 1-
hour resolution between January 2010 and July 2014. The Bz component of the HMF used in the study is in
the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric System (GSM), with X-axis pointed from the Earth to the Sun, the Y-axis
being perpendicular to the Earth magnetic dipole (the XZ-plane contains the dipole axis), and the positive Z-
axis is at the same meaning as the North magnetic pole.
Following Gonzalez & Tsurutani (1987), we extracted from the whole set of data all intense geomagnetic
storms, i.e., the cases when Bz< -10 nT and Dst < -100 nT for more than 3 h. During January 2010-July 2014
were registered 16 events with Bz < -10 nT for longer than 3 h (it is designated as case 1), 8 events with
Dst <â€”-100 nT for longer than 3 h (case 2), and 5 events fulfilling both conditions simultaneously, i.e., Bz<-10
NT and Dst<-100 nT during more than 3 h (case 3). All events are listed in Table 1. When an event's duration
was intermittent, we denote its duration as a sum (+) of hours. Some of these storms were discussed in the
context of geomagnetic events with intensified GIC risk (Bailey & Leonhardt, 2016). Although the Dst-index is
not the best indicator of GIC hazard (Cid et al., 2014), we use it here combined with the HMF Bz component
for the severity of geomagnetic storm assessment (Gonzalez et al., 1994).

In this work frame, we also considered two components of the geomagnetic field By, By measured in Belsk,
the Polish INTERMAGNET observatory. In summary, 5-years of measurements at 1-minute intervals have
been considered. Additionally, the first derivative of the geomagnetic field horizontal (H = |B% + BZ)
component By, dBy/dt has been considered as another indicator of strong magnetic storms (e.g., Adebesin et
al., 2016; Love et al., 2016; Ngwira et al., 2018).
Moreover, we analyse heliospheric parameters, a strength of HMF B [nT] and its B- [nT] component, solar
wind speed SWs [km/s], and proton density SWd [N/cm3], as well geomagnetic indices: ap-index [nT], AE-
index [nT], local K-index from Belsk. The maximal values of the above-mentioned parameters during the
analysed geomagnetic storms are listed in Table 1.
In 2019, electricity production in Poland was falling, with the most significant decrease seen in production
from lignite and hard coal. The share of coal in electricity production in 2019 was 73.6%, 4.8 percentage
points less than in 2018. In 2019, the import of electricity to Poland almost doubled, amounting to 10.6 TWh
(e.g., Macuk, 2020). There are three largest producers in the Polish energy market (which are parts of the
groups: PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A., TAURON Polska Energia S.A., ENEA S.A.) having in total almost
2/3 of the installed capacity and being responsible for almost 70% of domestic electricity production.
TAURON Capital Group (TCG) is the largest Polish electricity distributor, which data we are using here (Annual
Report, 2019).
We utilize around half of the million transmission line/network operator logs about electrical grid failures
(EGFs), starting from January 2010 to July 2014. EGFs causes were aggregated into six general groups denoted
by A-F (details in Gil et al., 2019). Comparable categorization was used by Zois (2013). The EGFs occurrence
rate in years 2010-2013 and during the first seven months of 2014 is presented in Table 2. Table 2 shows the
percentage of EGFs in each group from A to F in individual years, and collectively for the whole period of data
availability, i.e., in 2010-2014.
