light on the considered problem. Moreover, we plan to apply the determined geoelectric field for the
systematic studies of GIC. There is a need for future engineering analysis for quantitative failure studies to
understand their possible direct relationship to geomagnetically induced currents. Another exciting aspect of
analysis will be the improvement of the method of geoelectric field determination. We are aware that 1-D
layered Earth model conductivity used in this study changes vertically but not horizontally. Two-dimensional
and three-dimensional Earth conductivity structure introduces some features not seen with 1-D models
(Marti et al., 2014; Boteler & Pirjola, 2017). Therefore, the forthcoming study will take into account the
verification of other Earth modeling assumptions.
