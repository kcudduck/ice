3 Methodology
Among statistical methods that can be used to compare two sets of data, there are, for example, statistical
tests that verify the hypothesis of the equality of means or variances of these sets. Here, we applied the t-test
(see also the t-Student test) (Shao, 2003), as the most common and easy method to evaluate the differences
in means between two groups of data. The first group of our data determines the number of DEF failures that
occurred in time after such geomagnetic events from 2010 to 2014, in which the maximal value of time
derivative of By is not less than 25 nT/min, i.e. max(dBy/dt) = 25 nT/min. The second group determines the
number of DEF failures which occurred in times before max(dBy/dt) = 25 nT/min (so in the second group we
observe the failures of the type DEF that max(dBy/dt) < 25 nT/min). Let us assume that there are no
significant differences between their values in the two groups of data. Therefore, Hy: mq = my, where mq and
my express the means of the number of DEF failures of the first and second group, respectively, whereas Hy:
my # my is the alternative hypothesis. From the t-test distribution table, one takes a critical value t; , for a
given level of significance a and n degrees of freedom. The critical set for the t-test is (=, =tg nl U [tgp *). If
t< |tqgn| we do not reject hypothesis Hp, otherwise we accept Hq. The value of p, given in the t-test expresses
the probability of error involved in accepting hypothesis Hq about the existence of a difference.
Theoretically, the t-test can be applied even if the samples contain only a few observations, as long as the two
assumptions are satisfied, i.e., the variables have normal distributions within each group, and the variance of
scores in both groups is not substantially different. The first assumption on the “normality” of the data can be
estimated by looking at the data distribution histograms or performing a normality test. Here we have
applied the Shapiro - Wilk test (for small statistical samples). The second one can be verified by using the F
test (see also the test of F- Fischer) or by using the Levene test, as well as the Brown-Forsythe test (which is a
modification of the Levene test) (Shao, 2003).
In the next step of the analysis to determine geoelectric field {Ex, Ey} a layered conductivity Earth model has
been applied (see, e.g., Boteler et al., 2019; Boteler & Pirjola, 2019, and references therein). This 1-D model
considers the change of conductivity with depth in the Earth, representing it by N horizontal layers with
specified conductivities g, and thicknesses /, (n= 1, ..., N). The recursive relation expresses the layered case
of transfer function K (in frequency domain 7) (Weaver, 1994; Boteler & Pirjola, 2019):
Kni1(1+e 2knin) +p (1-e72Knin)
(1)
where K, denotes the ratio of £ to B at the top surface of layer n, while K+ at the top surface of the
underlying layer n + 1, ne , ky, = Ji2nfpugo, and Lig = 4mm x 1077 H/m (Boteler et al., 2019). The
kn
initial value in equation (1) is the case when the layer n= Nis a uniform half-space and K py = Vaal, while
the final value Kj is the transfer function relating £ and B at the Earth's surface (Trichtchenko & Boteler, 2002;
Boteler et al., 2019).
To perform analysis of data of geomagnetic horizontal field from Belsk station (see Sect. 2.1) we used a Earth
model number 45 of Adam et al. (2012), dedicated for Poland and consisted of 4 layers with, from the top
down, thicknesses and resistivities (1/0): 6 km, 5 Qm; 105 km, 1000 Qm; 300 km, 100 Qm; above a half space
of 10 Om. This Earth-layered model for the European regions has already been used in a number of studies
(e.g., Viljanen et al., 2013, 2014). Differences concerning various methods were emphasized by (e.g., Viljanen
et al., 2012; Kelbert & Lucas, 2020).
In the next step, by taking the Fourier transform we decomposed the 1-minute geomagnetic field {By, By}
data into its frequency components {Bx(/), Bf}. Then, each of these components has been multiplied by the
corresponding transfer function values giving the geoelectric field frequency components, namely, Ex(f) =
