presented here procedure has been implemented in Matlab software and checked using the synthetic
magnetic field variation considered in (Boteler, 2012; Boteler & Pirjola, 2019). What is more, to perform the
annual data analysis, the numerical calculations were carried out in the 3-day moving window. However, only
results for the mid-day have been finally saved and used in further studies.

3.3 Superposed epoch analysis
Superposed epoch analysis is a method manifesting links between studied time series (Chree, 1913). This
method application allowed to prove the existence of a 27-day variation in geomagnetic storm appearance
(Chree, 1913; Chree & Stagg, 1927), further showing that it is only the case of weaker geomagnetic storms
and the intense storms occur sporadically (Greaves & Newton, 1929). Denton et al. (2005) analysing relations
between the geomagnetic storm phase with temporal fluctuations of plasma found at geosynchronous orbit,
presented that for the plasma sheet density, one of the key-factor is the solar cycle. Superposed epoch
analysis was used in the Forbush decreases of galactic cosmic rays studies (Singh & Badruddin, 2006; Okike &
Umahi, 2019). Liemohn et al. (2008) explored an occurrence time or magnetic storms strength as their
features. Gil et al. (2019) showed an increase in the superposed averaged number of EGF appearing around
one day after the fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME) occurrence, on the day of sudden storm
commencement, as well as around zero-day or the day after when the daily maximal Kp geomagnetic index
value was greater or equal to 5.
Here we defined a pivot time based on the Table 1 as the day when there appeared the B>< -10 nT (case 1),
Dst < =100 nT (case 2) and both, B»< -10 nT and Dst < —=100 nT (case 3) during more than 3 h. Next, we
extracted subsets of daily sums of electrical network failures (of a particular type) during the whole week
around the pivot events, i.e., 3 days before and after each event. Subsequently, we superposed all extracted
subsets of failures, synchronizing all zero-days and normalising daily values to the average during the whole
week being equal to 0. We use this normalisation to highlight the percentage increase in the number of
failures.
3.4 Self-organizing maps
Self-organizing maps (SOM) are a type of artificial neural network trained with unsupervised learning. The
goal is to display training data’s input space as a low-dimensional, usually one or two-dimensional discretized
map (Kohonen, 1990). SOM networks have only two layers: input and output layers. The output layer is
represented as a map showing the topological proximity of mapped data points in a given space as a function
of the number of neurons (Somervuo & Kohonen, 1999). Similar inputs are grouped in close neurons. This
allows finding links between input data. Each input layer neuron is connected to each output layer neuron.
The connections between these neurons are assigned a certain weight. Unlike supervised learning, where the
winning neuron “takes it all”, the winning neuron'’s neighborhood is also updated in self-organizing maps (Hu
et al., 2019). The Kohonen rule is used for updating, as follows:
wis (E+ 1) = wi; (0) + a (Oh (Dx) — wy 1) ],
(2)
where wjjis the weight j of neuron J, a(?) is the learning rate, h(t) is the neighborhood function (Caldas et al,
2017) that determines the neighborhood of the winner. The neighborhood is estimated using a distance
function between neighbors, which may be the Euclidean function, the Gauss function, the Manhattan
distance function, etc.
SOMs are mainly used for data clustering and classification problems because a trained SOM aggregates
similar data elements into clusters (Lampinen & QOja, 1992; Caldas et al., 2017). In our case, the SOM has been
used to group selected heliospheric and geomagnetic parameters (see Sect. 2.1) with transmission line
failures (see Table 2). We focused on failures originating from the aging of the infrastructure elements (group
D), linked to electronic devices (group E), and having unknown reasons (group F).
4 Analysis results
4.1 Statistical analysis results
Firstly, we checked if there is an overall trend in the number of electrical grid failures, being (to some extent)
of solar origin. Thus, we have concentrated on failures originating from the aging of the infrastructure
elements (group D), linked to electronic devices (group E), and having unknown reasons (group F). Figure 1
