Powerful solar phenomena are the drivers of large-scale time variations of currents flowing in the Earth's mage
ionosphere and magnetosphere (e.g., Pulkkinen et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2015). Magnetic variations during
geomagnetic storms tend to be larger at higher latitudes. However, very powerful space weather events have Top

Svanda et al. (2020) and Vybost'okova & Svanda (2019) showed that the 5-10% increase of failures in the
Czech power grid recorded in the 5-day period following the enhanced geomagnetic activity is possibly linked
to geomagnetically induced current (GIC) effects. Svanda et al. (2020) presented that failures in power lines
were growing immediately (within 1 day). Failures regarding transformers were generally delayed by 2-3
days, still allowing the operation of power systems without registering problems until the cumulative damage
reached a sufficient level (more details in Kappenman, 2013; Wang et al., 2015).
Tozzi et al. (2018) reconstructed a latitudinal profile of maximum GIC indices for several geomagnetic storms
for different locations. They showed that the latitudinal variability of GIC intensity is almost the same for all
considered storms. Tozzi et al. (2019) studied the possible impact of space weather events on the Italian
territory by computing the GIC index for the 2015 St. Patrick's Day storm. Detrimental GICs could flow
through the power network, especially at the highest Italian latitudes characterized by a low conductivity
lithosphere. Zois (2013) found the correlation between solar activity and the annual number of transformer
failures in Greece for 1989-2010.
The main impact of GIC is system instability. It appears due to high levels of VAR (volt-amp reactive) and
significant current harmonics as a result of the transformer core part - cycle semi - saturation (Girgis &
Vedante, 2012). GIC as a function of time can be coupled with transformer temperature models to follow the
winding hot spot temperatures throughout the storm. It is reasonable to expect that most of the transformer
failures during an extreme geomagnetic storm would come from the population that has exceeded a critical
temperature threshold (Oughton et al., 2019). The hotspot temperature profile simulation for specific
transformers impacted by GIC based on the fitted analytical function was proposed by Marti et al. (2013).
Another critical issue is the loss of transformer life due to overheating during a storm. Even a transformer
whose winding hotspot remained below the critical temperature threshold may sustain insulation damage,
which reduces the transformer’s lifetime. This additional loss-of-life in years is essential as the reason for
aging electrical equipment. Threats of aging electrical equipment and components reduce their efficiency,
being potentially dangerous. Overheating in electrical enclosures can shorten the life of the equipment or
worse, leading to costly downtime (Vybost'okova & Svanda, 2019).
In our previous paper (Gil et al., 2020a), we computed the geoelectric field for Poland using the method by
Viljanen & Pirjola (1989). Basing on the data of electrical network failures in Southern Poland in 2010 and the
first seven months of 2014 and using various geomagnetic storm indicators (e.g., sudden storm
commencement, Kp > 5 and fast halo coronal mass ejecta appearance) we showed a grow in the number of
failures around that time. In this paper, we study the influence of intense geomagnetic storms on the
