5 Discussion
The timeline of the yearly EGFs from groups DEF, which might have the solar origin, in 2010-2014 presents
the rising linear trend connected with the more frequent intense geomagnetic storms in the rising phase of
solar activity cycle 24.
Superposed epoch analysis results show that on the day of and just after the intense geomagnetic storms,
there is observed a significant growth in the number of electrical grid failures in South Poland. The growth is
visible in the groups of failures that might be connected with space weather effects, i.e., EGFs triggered by the
aging of infrastructure elements, associated with electronic devices’ unreliability and having unknown causes.
What is more, group F's failures (of unknown reasons) seem to occur almost immediately (days + 0), while the
others have an apparent delay of 1-2 days.
Moreover, SOM analysis shows that proton density SWd had the most decisive impact on the number of
transmission line failures. Moreover, the strength of HMF B and ap-index had a strong influence on the
number of failures, mainly those from groups D and E. The most significant impact of the remaining
heliospheric and geomagnetic parameters was observed for data without delay.
The GIC related disturbances have an additional effect in the power network related to the response of
protection devices such as differential relays. The GIC flows in the electrical grid are not only connected to the
transformers overheating, but the spiked-narrow pulse of extra energy can also produce higher harmonics in
a transformer. As a result, transient states and resonance in the power grid may occur, differential relays may
enable protection, and the grid stability may be compromised (Girgis & Vedante, 2012; Power System
Relaying and Control Committee, 2019). Harmonics from GIC may affect the operation of power generators
(Meliopoulos et al., 2018) and propagate into other generators and transformers. The power grid response to
the transients and surges is unpredictable. There is a possibility of uncontrolled propagation of GIC origin
transients effects into other segments of the power network - therefore, more investigations are needed to
determine the effects of GIC in technical infrastructure.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we performed a systematic study of the influence of the most intense geomagnetic storms on
the functioning of electrical power grids in Poland in 2010-2014, which is around a half of the solar cycle.
The main findings of this work can be summarized as follows:

— yearly average number of transmission line failures in South Poland between January 2010 (near the
solar minimum) and July 2014 (around the solar maximum) show a rising trend, which can be the
indication of solar cycle phase dependency;

— during and right after the intense geomagnetic storms, there is observed a massive increase in the
number of electrical grid failures in South Poland, in the groups of failures which might be connected
with space weather effects, namely transmission line failures caused by the aging of infrastructure
elements, connected to the unreliability of electronic devices and having unknown reasons (groups
DEF);

— t-test was used to study the difference between means and standard deviations of two groups of DEF
failures (which might be related with space weather): the first for periods when max(dBy/dt) > 25 nT/min
and the second for max(dBy/dt) < 25 nT/min, in 2010-2014, with a delay of two (48 h) and three days
(72 h), showed that there exists the growth of the number of aging, electronic breakdowns and
unidentified type of failures for the group with max(dBy/dt) > 25 nT/min;

— increases of geoelectric field, computed for Poland region by using 1-D layered Earth model, correspond
to the intense geomagnetic storms occurrence;

— proton density SWd seems to have the most significant impact on the number of power grid failures in
the case without delay concerning the intense geomagnetic storms;

— other analyzed heliospheric and geomagnetic data (ap, AE, K indices, as well as solar wind speed and
HMF strength) also show a varying degree of impact on the number of power grid failures.

Summarizing, we see that during and right after intense geomagnetic storms, an increase in the number of
transmission line/network failures, which might be of solar origin, occurs.
