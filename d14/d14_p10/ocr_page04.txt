The role of geomagnetic storm-induced energet... https://www.scliencedirect.com/science/article...
It 1s widely accepted that at low- and mid-latitudes, ionospheric dynamics are
controlled predominantly by mechanisms of plasma transport (Richmond and Lu,
2000). However, Suvorova et al. (2012) found a prominent ionization effect produced
by intense fluxes of energetic electrons in the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere
outside of the SAA region during a geomagnetic storm of 15 December 2006.
Jayachandran et al. (2011) also provided clear evidence for a systematic and
propagating temporary total electron content (TEC) enhancement produced by
compression of the magnetosphere due to a sudden increase in solar wind dynamic
pressure, which led to the precipitation of energetic particles. 1 TECU variation can
cause range errors in the order of 0.163 m to GNSS signals at L1 channel (1.5754GHz)
(Klobuchar, 1996). It has also been reported that high-energy precipitation associated
with sub-storms produces small TEC enhancement, while lower-energy precipitation
produces large TEC enhancement (Watson et al., 2011; Suvorova et al., 2014). EPP
represents an important source of irregular plasma density structures in the high-
latitude ionosphere (Sato et al., 2018). Such irregular ionospheric electron density
structures scatter and diffract electromagnetic radio waves, creating unexpected
fluctuations in the received satellite signal through a process known as radio
scintillation. Scintillation effects on trans-ionospheric radio signals can lead to signal
errors or outright signal loss (Akala et al., 2012).

Proton fluxes are mostly intensified during the main phase of a magnetic storm
(Galand and Richmond, 2001). It has also been shown that in regions where most of
the energy is carried by protons, the influence of proton precipitation on ionospheric
conductance can be large (Galand et al., 2001a); this is because energetic protons
ionize more effectively than electrons do, as their energy loss per electron produced is
less compared with that of electrons (Galand and Richmond, 2001). Furthermore, it
has been shown that protons can represent the major source of ionization of the E-
region in the dusk and midnight sectors of the auroral oval (e.g., Galand and
Richmond, 2001; Smirnova et al., 2004).

The responses of the upper atmosphere to energetic particles have been studied, but
most of the previous studies did not capture the role of proton fluxes in ionospheric
responses, particularly, on a latitudinal scale. Another major research gap of note is
that studies on the influences of geomagnetic storm-induced EPPs on the African
ionosphere are quite sparse. Moreover, although some studies have examined the
modulation of the ionosphere by energetic particle precipitation during geomagnetic
storms (Gussenhoven et al., 1987; Suvorova et al., 2012), the study of the effect of
energetic particles on the ionosphere, particularly in line with the intensity and
drivers of storms has not been well carried out. Additionally, the latitudinal conjugate
and longitudinal effects of this storm-time energization of particle fluxes and their
