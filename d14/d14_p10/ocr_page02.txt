Abstract
Geomagnetic storms are associated with changes in electron and proton fluxes in the
radiation belts, leading to precipitation. However, most past studies have been done
based on stormsâ€™ intensities. This study investigates the roles of eight geomagnetic
storms, classified by their intensities using Dst threshold conditions, and
interplanetary drivers, in the production of Energetic Particle Precipitation (EPP), and
their subsequent modification of ionospheric irregularities and Total Electron Content
(TEC). We used energetic particle fluxes, TEC, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar
wind data. The rate of TEC index (ROTI) was used as a proxy for ionospheric
irregularities. In this study, the ability of a storm to induce EPPs is predominant and
significant during the recovery phases of storms. Consequently, the modifications of
the ionosphere caused by EPPs were mostly pronounced during the recovery phase of
a storm. At the recovery phases, enhanced EPPs induced by intense sheath (SH)- and
Corotating Interaction Region (CIR)-driven storms caused corresponding
enhancements in TEC and ionospheric irregularities, while that of intense magnetic
cloud (MC)-driven storm showed no significant effect on TEC and irregularities.
Furthermore, enhanced EPP induced by intense and moderate MC+SH-driven storms
caused little or no change in TEC and ionospheric irregularities. In addition, an
enhanced EPP induced by moderate sheath- and MC-driven storms caused depletion
in TEC and irregularities. Irregularities were more prevalent at the low- and high-
latitude, but less in occurrences at the mid-latitude in the African sector. Overall, from
this study, the African sector responded more to the energetic particles than the
American sector. Irregularities at the high-latitude stations were generally high and
frequent regardless of the phase, magnitude, driver, or local times of occurrence of
storms. The storm-induced EPP enhancements were more significant in the southern
hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, and the events of the equinoctial
months showed more dependence on EPPs.
Introduction
The Earth's ionosphere 1s embedded in the magnetosphere; a cavity carved by the
interaction of the high-speed solar wind and its frozen-in magnetic field with the
terrestrial magnetic field. Variations in the solar wind and its magnetic field are
known to be the major driver of changes in high-latitude ionospheric convection,
optical auroral intensifications, and current systems (Sibeck et al., 1999; Jayachandran
and MacDougall, 2000; Boudouridis et al., 2004). It 1s now well established that a
geomagnetic storm is the consequence of a chain of causative events originating from
the Sun and ultimately evolving into a geoeffective solar wind flow in the near-Earth
