Abstract Geomagnetic storms are associated with changes in electron and proton fluxes in the radiation belts, leading to precipitation. However, most past studies have been done based on storms’ intensities. This study investigates the roles of eight geomagnetic storms, classified by their intensities using Dst threshold conditions, and interplanetary drivers, in the production of Energetic Particle Precipitation (EPP), and their subsequent modification of ionospheric irregularities and Total Electron Content (TEC). We used energetic particle fluxes, TEC, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar wind data. The rate of TEC index (ROTI) was used as a proxy for ionospheric irregularities. In this study, the ability of a storm to induce EPPs is predominant and significant during the recovery phases of storms. Consequently, the modifications of the ionosphere caused by EPPs were mostly pronounced during the recovery phase of a storm. At the recovery phases, enhanced EPPs induced by intense sheath (SH)- and Corotating Interaction Region (CIR)-driven storms caused corresponding enhancements in TEC and ionospheric irregularities, while that of intense magnetic  cloud (MC)-driven storm showed no significant effect on TEC and irregularities. Furthermore, enhanced EPP induced by intense and moderate MC   +   SH-driven storms caused little or no change in TEC and ionospheric irregularities. In addition, an enhanced EPP induced by moderate sheath- and MC-driven storms caused depletion in TEC and irregularities. Irregularities were more prevalent at the low- and high- latitude, but less in occurrences at the mid-latitude in the African sector. Overall, from this study, the African sector responded more to the energetic particles than the American sector. Irregularities at the high-latitude stations were generally high and frequent regardless of the phase, magnitude, driver, or local times of occurrence of storms. The storm-induced EPP enhancements were more significant in the   southern  hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, and the events of the equinoctial months showed more dependence on EPPs. Introduction The Earth's ionosphere is embedded in the magnetosphere; a cavity carved by the interaction of the high-speed solar wind and its frozen-in magnetic field with the terrestrial magnetic field. Variations in the solar wind and its magnetic field are known to be the major driver of changes in high-latitude ionospheric convection, optical auroral intensifications, and current systems (Sibeck et al., 1999; Jayachandran and MacDougall, 2000; Boudouridis et al., 2004). It is now well established that a geomagnetic storm is the consequence of a chain of causative events originating from the Sun and ultimately evolving into a geoeffective solar wind flow in the near-Earth  The   role   of   geomagnetic   storm-induced   energet...   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article... 2   of   8   27/09/2025,   18:11

environment (Brueckner et al., 1998; Webb et al., 2001; Berdichevsky et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003; dal Lago et al., 2004; Gopalswamy et al., 2005). Geomagnetic storms are harmful disturbances in the Earth's geo-space environment (Gonzalez et al., 1994; Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997). During and after geomagnetic storms, charged particles (electrons, protons, and ions) are injected into the Earth's magnetosphere (radiation belts) where they are accelerated with high velocities via wave-particle interactions (Friedel et al., 2002). Thus, very drastic changes in the radiation belt particles have been observed during magnetic storms (McIlwain, 1966). The decrease that occurs during the main phase of a magnetic storm is followed by an increase during the storm's recovery phase, which sometimes exceeds the pre-storm level (Obara et al., 2000). Energetic Particle Precipitation (EPP) is an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs when previously trapped electrons and protons in the radiation belts enter the Earth's atmosphere, thus creating interferences and other disturbances to communication signals. Much attention has been paid to this phenomenon since a large enhancement of relativistic electrons caused fatal damage to satellite operations (Gussenhoven et al., 1987). Precipitations of energetic electrons is one of the main ionizing sources in the polar and high-latitude regions and probably in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) (Vampola and Gorney, 1983). This is because EPP has enough energy to knock out electrons from the neutrals at a higher rate than recombining with them in the upper atmosphere, thus increasing the number of ions. It is well known that EPP from the ring current and radiation belts causes chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, e.g., the creation of NOx and HOx molecules, which can catalytically destroy the ozone layer (Randall et al., 2005; Verronen et al., 2011; Sinnhuber et al., 2014) mostly during polar winter when there is little or no sunlight. This in turn is known to cause changes in atmospheric temperature profile, which leads to changes in atmospheric circulation that could propagate even to the ground (Langematz et al., 2003; Baumgaertner et al., 2011; Maliniemi et al., 2013). Essentially, all geomagnetic storms substantially alter the electron radiation belt populations (Reeves et al., 2003, Green et al., 2004). Anderson et al. (2015) showed that small geomagnetic storms affect the radiation belt acceleration and loss in much the same way as large storms. Energetic particles that precipitate into the atmosphere come from different sources: the Sun in large solar particle events (SPEs), the aurora and the radiation belts during geomagnetic storms and substorms, or outside the solar system. The particles from these various sources have different energy spectra and interact differently with the terrestrial magnetic field; therefore, they affect different altitudes and geographic regions (Sinnhuber et al., 2012).

It is widely accepted that at low- and mid-latitudes, ionospheric dynamics are controlled predominantly by mechanisms of plasma transport (Richmond and Lu, 2000). However, Suvorova et al. (2012) found a prominent ionization effect produced by intense fluxes of energetic electrons in the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere outside of the SAA region during a geomagnetic storm of 15 December 2006. Jayachandran et al. (2011) also provided clear evidence for a systematic and propagating temporary total electron content (TEC) enhancement produced by compression of the magnetosphere due to a sudden increase in solar wind dynamic pressure, which led to the precipitation of energetic particles. 1 TECU variation can cause range errors in the order of 0.163   m to GNSS signals at L1 channel (1.5754   GHz) (Klobuchar, 1996). It has also been reported that high-energy precipitation associated with sub-storms produces small TEC enhancement, while lower-energy precipitation produces large TEC enhancement (Watson et al., 2011; Suvorova et al., 2014). EPP represents an important source of irregular plasma density structures in the high- latitude ionosphere (Sato et al., 2018). Such irregular ionospheric electron density structures scatter and diffract electromagnetic radio waves, creating unexpected fluctuations in the received satellite signal through a process known as radio scintillation. Scintillation effects on trans-ionospheric radio signals can lead to signal errors or outright signal loss (Akala et al., 2012). Proton fluxes are mostly intensified during the main phase of a magnetic storm (Galand and Richmond, 2001). It has also been shown that in regions where most of the energy is carried by protons, the influence of proton precipitation on ionospheric conductance can be large (Galand et al., 2001a); this is because energetic protons ionize more effectively than electrons do, as their energy loss per electron produced is less compared with that of electrons (Galand and Richmond, 2001). Furthermore, it has been shown that protons can represent the major source of ionization of the E- region in the dusk and midnight sectors of the auroral oval (e.g., Galand and Richmond, 2001; Smirnova et al., 2004). The responses of the upper atmosphere to energetic particles have been studied, but most of the previous studies did not capture the role of proton fluxes in ionospheric responses, particularly, on a latitudinal scale. Another major research gap of note is that studies on the influences of geomagnetic storm-induced EPPs on the African ionosphere are quite sparse. Moreover, although some studies have examined the modulation of the ionosphere by energetic particle precipitation during geomagnetic storms (Gussenhoven et al., 1987; Suvorova et al., 2012), the study of the effect of energetic particles on the ionosphere, particularly in line with the intensity and drivers of storms has not been well carried out. Additionally, the latitudinal conjugate and longitudinal effects of this storm-time energization of particle fluxes and their  The   role   of   geomagnetic   storm-induced   energet...   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article... 4   of   8   27/09/2025,   18:11

resultant modification of ionospheric electron density still lack in-depth knowledge. Furthermore, the transit speed and time of arrival estimations of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME), which constitute important aspects of accurate space weather forecasting (Anatoly et al., 2022), have been shown to depend not only on the initial speed but also on the longitude of the solar source (Hildner et al., 1976; Anatoly et al., 2022). In view of these, the current study investigates the production of EPPs in relation to the drivers and intensities of the geomagnetic storms and the subsequent responses of the ionosphere to EPPs over the African sector and then compares the results with the results from the American sector. For this longitudinal comparison, eight disturbed periods across twelve GNSS stations spanning through the low-, mid-, and high-latitude regions in the American and African longitudinal sectors were considered. Section snippets Data and method of analysis We selected and analyzed four moderate storms and four intense storms that occurred during solar cycle 24. The storms were classified by using Dst threshold conditions defined by Gonzalez et al. (1994); great (intense) storms are those with a peak density of   − 100nT or less, moderate storms fall between   − 50nT and   − 100nT, and weak storms are those between   − 30nT and   − 50nT. The storms were further classified based on their drivers (e.g., Echer et al., 2008; Arowolo et al., 2021). This selection was … Moderate storms Fig. 2, Fig. 3 show the events of the moderate CIR-driven storms of 28 May 2011.

We also investigated the role of these particles in the ionization of the ionosphere and irregularities generation in the ionosphere. The EPP interacts with neutrals in the upper atmosphere through secondary emission, a process where more energetic particles knock out electrons, producing more electrons and ions. The rate at which this occurs varies … Conclusion Eight geomagnetic storms, classified according to their intensities and drivers, and their capabilities to generate EPPs were investigated. Furthermore, the responses of the American and African ionospheric TEC and irregularities to the EPPs were also investigated. The enhanced electron flux induced by the intense sheath-driven storm caused enhancement in TEC and ionospheric irregularities in the African low-latitude and the American high-latitude.
