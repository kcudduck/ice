environment (Brueckner et al., 1998; Webb et al., 2001; Berdichevsky et al., 2002;
Zhang et al., 2003; dal Lago et al., 2004; Gopalswamy et al., 2005). Geomagnetic
storms are harmful disturbances in the Earth's geo-space environment (Gonzalez et
al., 1994; Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997).
During and after geomagnetic storms, charged particles (electrons, protons, and ions)
are injected into the Earth's magnetosphere (radiation belts) where they are
accelerated with high velocities via wave-particle interactions (Friedel et al., 2002).
Thus, very drastic changes in the radiation belt particles have been observed during
magnetic storms (Mcllwain, 1966). The decrease that occurs during the main phase of
a magnetic storm is followed by an increase during the storm's recovery phase, which
sometimes exceeds the pre-storm level (Obara et al., 2000). Energetic Particle
Precipitation (EPP) is an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs when previously
trapped electrons and protons in the radiation belts enter the Earth's atmosphere,
thus creating interferences and other disturbances to communication signals. Much
attention has been paid to this phenomenon since a large enhancement of relativistic
electrons caused fatal damage to satellite operations (Gussenhoven et al., 1987).
Precipitations of energetic electrons is one of the main ionizing sources in the polar
and high-latitude regions and probably in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly
(SAA) (Vampola and Gorney, 1983). This is because EPP has enough energy to knock
out electrons from the neutrals at a higher rate than recombining with them in the
upper atmosphere, thus increasing the number of 1ons. It is well known that EPP from
the ring current and radiation belts causes chemical changes in the upper atmosphere,
e.g., the creation of NOx and HOx molecules, which can catalytically destroy the ozone
layer (Randall et al., 2005; Verronen et al., 2011; Sinnhuber et al., 2014) mostly during
polar winter when there is little or no sunlight. This in turn is known to cause changes
in atmospheric temperature profile, which leads to changes in atmospheric circulation
that could propagate even to the ground (Langematz et al., 2003; Baumgaertner et al.,
2011; Maliniemi et al., 2013). Essentially, all geomagnetic storms substantially alter
the electron radiation belt populations (Reeves et al., 2003, Green et al., 2004).
Anderson et al. (2015) showed that small geomagnetic storms affect the radiation belt
acceleration and loss in much the same way as large storms.
Energetic particles that precipitate into the atmosphere come from different sources:
the Sun in large solar particle events (SPEs), the aurora and the radiation belts during
geomagnetic storms and substorms, or outside the solar system. The particles from
these various sources have different energy spectra and interact differently with the
terrestrial magnetic field; therefore, they affect different altitudes and geographic
regions (Sinnhuber et al., 2012).
