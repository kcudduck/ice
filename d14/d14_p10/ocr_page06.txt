Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed the production of EPPs by eight geomagnetic storms
based on their intensities and drivers during solar cycle 24. We also investigated the
role of these particles in the ionization of the ionosphere and irregularities generation
in the ionosphere. The EPP interacts with neutrals in the upper atmosphere through
secondary emission, a process where more energetic particles knock out electrons,
producing more electrons and ions. The rate at which this occurs varies ...
Conclusion
Eight geomagnetic storms, classified according to their intensities and drivers, and
their capabilities to generate EPPs were investigated. Furthermore, the responses of
the American and African ionospheric TEC and irregularities to the EPPs were also
investigated. The enhanced electron flux induced by the intense sheath-driven storm
caused enhancement in TEC and 1onospheric irregularities in the African low-latitude
and the American high-latitude. Conversely, the enhanced EPP induced by the ...
