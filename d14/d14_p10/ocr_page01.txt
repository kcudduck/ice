Highlights
* Dependence of energetic particle precipitations (EPP) on storms
drivers and intensities.
» Total electron content (TEC) and rate of TEC index (ROTI) are used
to measure the response of the ionosphere to EPP.
« Both intensities and drivers of storms play important roles in the
production of EPP.
» African sector ionosphere responded to EPP better than the
American sector.
