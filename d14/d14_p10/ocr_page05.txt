resultant modification of ionospheric electron density still lack in-depth knowledge.
Furthermore, the transit speed and time of arrival estimations of interplanetary
coronal mass ejection (ICME), which constitute important aspects of accurate space
weather forecasting (Anatoly et al., 2022), have been shown to depend not only on the
initial speed but also on the longitude of the solar source (Hildner et al., 1976; Anatoly
et al., 2022). In view of these, the current study investigates the production of EPPs in
relation to the drivers and intensities of the geomagnetic storms and the subsequent
responses of the ionosphere to EPPs over the African sector and then compares the
results with the results from the American sector. For this longitudinal comparison,
eight disturbed periods across twelve GNSS stations spanning through the low-, mid-,
and high-latitude regions in the American and African longitudinal sectors were
considered.

Data and method of analysis
We selected and analyzed four moderate storms and four intense storms that occurred
during solar cycle 24. The storms were classified by using Dst threshold conditions
defined by Gonzalez et al. (1994); great (intense) storms are those with a peak density
of —100nT or less, moderate storms fall between -50nT and —100nT, and weak storms
are those between -30nT and -50nT. The storms were further classified based on their
drivers (e.g., Echer et al., 2008; Arowolo et al., 2021). This selection was ...
Moderate storms
Fig. 2, Fig. 3 show the events of the moderate CIR-driven storms of 28 May 2011. The
Bz and temperature values at the time of the commencement of the storm were
—-10.7nT and 29900K respectively. The maximum wind speed 1s 767 km/s and occurred
on the 29th of May at 11:00UT. There was an increase in the other IMF and wind
parameters in the main phase. The storm showed enhancement in both electron flux
and proton flux during the recovery phase, which commenced around 14:00UT on the
