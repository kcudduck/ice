low-latitude 10nosphere, it has to be the duration of the non-fluctuating or consistent southward IMF B,, in addition to poleward
conditions of the neutral wind, to determine the ionospheric responses over these regions, irrespective of the intensity of the
geomagnetic storm. This case study becomes important for understanding changes in the low-latitude ionosphere during such
cases of weak space weather events which often get ignored due to the general expectation of weaker impacts on the ionosphere
under such conditions. The present study also becomes vital for developing a reliable space weather forecast system, in terms of
incorporation, of the time duration effect of the southward IMF, into the upcoming state-of-the-art machine learning modules, over
the low-latitude regions.

The manuscript 1s divided as follows: Section 2 describes the data and the methodologies used in the present study. Section 3
describes the results, including the sources of geomagnetic storms, the interplanetary and SYM-H conditions, and the ionospheric
conditions. Section 4 presents the discussions of the physical mechanisms to have produced such observations while Section 5
summarizes the work.

2. Data and Methodology

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), presently known as the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC),
1s a regional navigation satellite system developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Three Geostationary Earth
Orbit satellites (GEOs) and three Geo-Synchronous Orbit satellites (GSOs) comprise the space segment of NavIC which have
continuous visibility on the ionosphere over the Indian region. These satellites broadcast in the LS having a carrier frequency
of 1176.45 MHz and in the S1 band having a carrier frequency of 2492.028 MHz. NavIC has been conceived primarily for the
estimation of errors in positioning, mainly over the entire Indian region, that has the northern crest of EIA and the geomagnetic
equator passing over it. Furthermore, the suitability of NavIC to study the upper atmosphere has been well-established by several
researchers (Rethika et al., 2015; Sharat et al., 2017; Mehulkumar & Shweta, 2018; Desai & Shweta, 2018; Ayyagari et al., 2019,
2020a b; Ravi Kumar et al., 2019; Chakraborty & Datta, 2020; Ayyagari et al., 2021; Chakraborty & Datta, 2021; Ayyagari et al.,
2022; Chakraborty & Datta, 2024) as well as Kumar et al. (2022) where NavIC data are used to separate the spatial and temporal
effects. It 1s important to note the consistency between the VTECs of NavIC and GPS, both under quiet and disturbed conditions and
when compared with the various global ionospheric models over the Indian longitude sector (Ayyagari et al., 2020a; Chakraborty
et al., 2020b), further solidifying its observational capabilities related to regional 10nospheric research.

The Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad has been operating an Accord-make NavIC receiver, since July 2017,
capable of receiving GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz) along with NavIC LS and S1 signals. The Slant TEC (ST EC) 1s one of the outputs
given by the receivers. The STEC 1s converted to the equivalent Vertical TEC (VTEC). This conversion (equation [2) uses a
mapping function M (equation|1) assuming the ionosphere as a thin shell at an altitude (H) of 350 km (Klobuchar (1996); Breed
et al. (1997); Jakowski et al. (2011) and references therein).

Here Rg = 6371 km 1s the radius of Earth and 6 are the elevation angles of the satellites. It 1s to be noted that to reduce the effects

of multipath error on the NavIC signals, elevation angles > 30Â° have been chosen for the entire analysis.
