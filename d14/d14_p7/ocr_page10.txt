attributed to the presence of the effects of the neutral winds that could have played a role, in tandem with the non-fluctuating PPEF,
in causing a higher variation in TEC over this location and Ahmedabad on October 31, 2021. The following paragraph discusses
this aspect in detail.

Now, the neutral dynamics such as the thermospheric winds play a role in the modulation of the responses of the ionosphere dur-
ing storm-time conditions. These winds contribute to the equatorial E X B plasma drift causing variations in the 1on-recombination
rate and alterations of the TEC (Rishbeth, 1997; Heelis, 2004). In general, the poleward winds move the plasma down to the lower
altitudes where the recombination rate 1s comparatively large. This in turn results in the reduction in the peak height (hmF2) and
hence a decrease in the peak electron density (Shim, 2009). Studies by (see Buresova et al. (2014) and references therein) have
shown that the disturbances in the ionosphere are a combination of several processes or mechanisms, where the dominating mech-
anism and its significance might vary from one event to the other. Therefore, to show any possible effects of the neutral dynamics
on TEC, in addition to the effects of the PPEF, during October 31 and November 04, 2021, the variations from the WACCM-X
simulated 350 km meridional wind velocities (m/s) over the observation site 1s shown in Figure|6| In this Figure, one can observe a
higher magnitude of the poleward wind on November 04 compared to October 31 between 9 and 10 UT (which is the period around
the observed diurnal maximum of TEC). Specifically, on October 31, at 9:30 UT, wind velocities are about 16 m/s whereas at the
same time, on November 04, 2021, wind velocities are close to 32 m/s. We believe that this difference might have played some role,
in tandem with the PPEF, that had caused the anomalous variations in TEC on October 31 and November 04, 2021.

While using the wind estimates from the WACCM-X model, one may wonder how well correlated the model outputs are com-
pared to actual observations. In a study by (Liu et al., 2019), they compare WACCM-X simulations with the WINDII observations
of high-latitude wind under different solar radio flux levels and varying geomagnetic conditions. They conclude that the WINDII
observations are in good agreement with the WACCM-X estimates. However, the magnitude of the wind estimate from the model 1s
lower than that of observations, although the wind variation 1s quite similar. This underestimation of the model could be attributed
to the fact that WACCM-X 1s a climatological model and the abrupt changes in the wind velocity under different geomagnetic dis-
turbances, may not always be captured. However, since WACCM-X 1s a self-consistent general circulation model that couples the
