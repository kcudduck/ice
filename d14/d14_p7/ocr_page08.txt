conditions, significant variations from these general trends can be observed. For example, in the recent study by (Lissa et al., 2021),
they highlighted that quiet-time seasonal trends are not observed during disturbed periods, especially under moderate solar activity
conditions, a higher difference in TEC (from the quiet-time values) can be observed and there are also reductions in the correlation
between the solar flux and the diurnal maximum TEC under storm-time conditions.

Under quiet-time conditions, it 1s well known that increases in the upward plasma motion, and hence the plasma getting raised
to higher altitudes, are caused by enhancements 1n the E X B vertical drifts. In this process, redistribution of plasma occurs from the
equatorial regions to the regions in and around the EIA crest. However, under storm-time conditions, the PPEF produces changes
in the low-latitude ionosphere by lifting the equatorial ionosphere to higher altitudes while decreasing the plasma density at the
bottomside ionosphere. These F-region uplifts that are caused by the PPEFs, further increase the altitudes of these plasma. This
process reduces the rate of recombination which in turn leads to high electron densities and intensification in the TEC over the EIA
crest regions (Wei et al., 2015). In the current study, due to the presence of the MC region and subsequent stable IMF B,, we observe
higher values of TEC during a weaker event as compared to the stronger one when the IMF B, had been strongly fluctuating due
to the presence of the sheath region. The observations of such anomalous response of the low-latitude ionosphere (over quiet-time
values) to MC-like and sheath-region-induced disturbances, are described next.

Figures and [4] show the 1onospheric diurnal VTEC variations as observed by the NavIiC PRNs 3 and 6 along with the EEJ
variation during the entire analysis period. The titles on top of the first panels in both the figures show the corresponding days in the
format: DD-MM-YY YY. In all the panels of these two figures, to observe significant differences/enhancements from the day-to-day
variability, the average of the three quietest days’ VTEC and EEJ values are plotted as blue curves. The three quietest days selected
here are October 27, 28, and 29, 2021, based on the availability of both the TEC and the EEJ data around the analysis period. The
observed VTEC variations on the individual days are plotted in red curves. The horizontal bars in these figures show the 1-sigma
level to designate the VTEC and EEJ variations, beyond these limits, to be significant due to solar forcing and not due to the daily
variabilities.

Figure 3] panels (a) to (1) show these variations from October 29- November 01, 2021. The day of October 29, being one of the
quietest days shows the VTEC variations to be well within the significance bars and close to the quiet-time variation as observed
by PRNs 3 (panel (a)) and 6 (panel (e)). Coming to panels (¢) and (g) of the same figure, it can be noted that there have been
significant rises in the VTEC values as observed by the NaviC PRNs, on October 31, 2021. This 1s the same day when there had
been successive weak geomagnetic storm occurrences (see Figure [2| panel (d)). The diurnal maximum around 09:30 UT (14:30
LT) showed enhancements of about 20 TECU over the quiet-time variation, as observed by PRN 3. Interestingly, PRN 6 showed a
significant enhancement but with a lower value of about 15 TECU over the quiet-time values around the same time. This could be
attributed to the fact that the IPP separation between these PRN 1s about 4.5° and hence the ionospheric plasma volumes intercepted
by these PRNs would be different. For the day (November O01, 2021) after the event day (October 31, 2021), panels (d) and (h)
for PRNs 3 and 6 respectively, show no significant enhancements in the VTEC. Coming to Figure 4] no significant enhancements
outside the 1-sigma limits in the VTEC variations are observed in panels (¢) and (g) for PRN 3 and PRN 6 on November 04, 2021,
respectively, despite the occurrence of the strong geomagnetic storm (see panel (d) of Figure|2). Additionally, the observation of a
lesser geoeffectivity on November 04, can be attributed to the presence of Alfvenic wave fluctuations as a result of interacting CMEs
(with the second CME having a higher velocity than the first and assuming no acceleration and/or deceleration in the interplanetary
medium) that occurred during November 01-02, 2021.
