Fig. 2. Figure panels (a) to (f) show the IMFs |B|, By, By, B, the IEF, and the SYM-H (nT) variations respectively. In the same figure, panels (g) to (I) show the
Proton Temperature, the Vj, the Proton Density, the Flow Pressure, the PC index, and the § respectively between October 29 and November 05, 2021. The period
of the weak and the strong geomagnetic storm occurrences are shown as violet- and peach-shaded regions respectively.
while the SYM-H reached its minimum value of -118 nT at 12:45 UT (17:45 LT) on November 04, 2021. The corresponding values
of IMFs |B|, By, By, B;, IEF, Proton Temperature, V,, Proton Density, Flow Pressure, PC index, and 8 during the main phase
onset and the SYM-H minimum were (23.33 nT, 6.79 nT, 15.81 nT, -15.68 nT, 11.23 mV/m, 41.0965%10* K, 716.10 km/s, 7.66
n/cc, 7.86 nPa, 10.34 and 0.32 respectively) and (14.00 nT, -7.60 nT, 11.73 nT, 0.71 nT, -0.49 mV/m, 1.7323*10* K, 686.10 km/s,
4.83 n/cc, 4.55 nPa, 4.32 and 0.15 respectively).

Comparing the two shaded regions, one can observe enhanced IMF, Proton Temperature, Density, and Pressure variations in
addition to enhanced values of solar wind velocities, for the peach-shaded stronger event (November 04, 2021). These observations
suggest a highly compressed and turbulent plasma and clearly show the presence of a sheath region during this period. Since these
sheath regions are highly turbulent as a result of plasma instabilities, they are capable of triggering substorms, which in turn affects
the auroral and high-latitude as well as low/equatorial ionosphere (see Blagoveshchenski (2013); Hui et al. (2017); Rout et al.
(2018); Fejer et al. (2021) and references therein).

3.3. lonospheric conditions

The 10onospheric TEC 1s known to vary on a daily basis, with time, over different seasons and locations (latitude and longitude)
as well as with varying solar activity levels. Over the Indian longitude sector and under quiet-time conditions, the daytime values
of TEC are observed to be higher during equinoctial months (Vernal: March and April; Autumnal: September and October)
followed by the winter (November to February) and the summer (May to August) months. These seasonal trends are controlled
by the thermospheric neutral wind that changes the neutral composition as well as increases the O/N, ratio over the low/equatorial
latitudes, attaining peak values over the equinoctial periods. This increase in the O/N, ratio causes increases in the electron density
and corresponding higher TEC values are observed during the equinoctial months (Bagiya et al., 2009). However, under disturbed
