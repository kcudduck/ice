windows of the different phases of interaction will depend on the ambient solar wind, the mass and initial speed of individual CMEs,
magnetic structures and orientations, the time interval between the two individual CME eruptions, the relative speed between the
two CMEs (Scolimi et al., 2020). Although most geomagnetic storms are driven by a single CME, about 27% events (Zhang &
Wang, 2002) are observed to be caused by the passage of interacting CMEs as well as the Stream Interaction Regions (SIRs)
which gets formed when the High-Speed Streams (HSS) (about 600-800 km/s and emanating from the coronal holes) catch up
with the slower streams (about 300-400 km/s) that are ahead and compress them. Using in situ and remote-sensing observations,
an investigation by (Shen et al., 2018) estimated geoeflectivity amplification (by an almost double factor) of individual CMEs due
to CME-CME interactions at 1 AU. Furthermore, interacting CMEs lead to Alfvenic wave fluctuations which in turn may affect
the solar wind electric field. Alfvenic oscillations are oscillations of both the motion of the plasma and the magnetic field, with
the energy of the wave propagating along the magnetic field lines. Apart from the solar wind and the solar atmosphere, these
oscillations are also found in the magnetosphere of our planet, arising from the disturbances within the magnetosphere itself or
from the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Dhamane et al. (2023) suggested that the interaction or collision between the CME
and HSS deforms the MC of the CME which in turn generates Alfven waves inside the MC.

3.2. Interplanetary and Geomagnetic conditions

Figure 2|shows the SYM-H and the interplanetary conditions between October 29 and November 05, 2021. Figure|2| panels (a)
to (d) show the IMFs |B|, By, B,, B; (nT) variations respectively, panels: (e) and (f) show the Interplanetary Electric Field (IEF,
mV/m) and the SYM-H (nT) variations respectively. In the same figure, panels: (g) to (1) respectively show the Proton Temperature
(10* K), the Solar Wind Flow Speed (V,, km/s), the Proton Density (n/cc), the Flow Pressure (nPa), the Polar Cap (PC) index
and the Plasma Beta (8). The periods of weak geomagnetic storm occurrences are shown as the violet-shaded region while the
sheath region and the corresponding strong geomagnetic storm occurrence are shown as the peach-shaded region in this figure. The
coverages (LT = UT + 5h) of the main phase of the weak geomagnetic storms are from 02:36 to 10:00 LT on October 31, 2021, and
from 16:52 on October 31 to 01:59 LT on November 01, 2021, while the same for the stronger event is from 02:36 to 17:45 LT on
November 04, 2021.

The Storm Sudden Commencement (SSC) of the weak storm occurred at 20:05 UT (01:05 LT) on October 30 (31), 2021. The
main phase of this relatively weaker (compared to the storm occurring on November 03-04, 2021) storm started at 21:36 UT (02:36
LT) on October 30 (31), 2021. The corresponding values of IMFs |B|, By, B,, B;, IEF, Proton Temperature, Vj,,, Proton Density,
Flow Pressure, PC index and 8 were 8.04 nT, 1.11 nT, -2.98 nT, -7.37 nT, 2.72 mV/m, 9.6317%10* K, 368.90 km/s, 14.64 n/cc, 3.98
nPa, 1.29 and 2.12 respectively. The SYM-H dropped to a minimum with the value of -41 nT at 05:00 UT (10:00 LT) on October
31, 2021. Next, a second weak storm occurred when the main phase started at 11:52 UT (16:52 LT) on October 31, 2021, with the
corresponding IMFs |B|, By, By, B;, IEF, Proton Temperature, Vy,,, Proton Density, Flow Pressure, PC index and ยง values of 10.54
nT, -4.68 nT, 5.76 nT, -7.46 nT, 3.24 mV/m, 13.8349*%10* K, 433.90 km/s, 19.85 n/cc, 7.47 nPa, 1.63 and 1.98 respectively. It 1s to
be noted that during this period, the SYM-H had two minimum peaks with values of -36 nT and -37 nT at 13:24 UT (18:24 LT on
October 31, 2021) and 20:59 UT (01:59 LT on November 01, 2021) respectively. The corresponding values of IMFs |B|, B,, By, B.,
IEF, Proton Temperature, Vi, Proton Density, Flow Pressure, PC index, and ยง during these two SYM-H drops were (10.67 nT,
7.65 nT, 7.22 nT, -1.73 nT, 0.75 mV/m, 12.2953*10* K, 432.40 km/s, 10.31 n/cc, 3.86 nPa, 4.69 and 0.95 respectively) and (7.93
nT, -6.39 nT, -0.49 nT, -4.67 nT, 2.11 mV/m, 4.9839*10* K, 452.70 km/s, 6.16 n/cc, 2.52 nPa, 3.37 and 0.73 respectively).

Further on observing the peach-shaded region depicting the strong geomagnetic storm, the SSC had occurred at 19:44 UT (00:44
LT) on November 03 (04), 2021. The main phase of the strong storm started at 21:36 UT (02:36 LT) on November 03 (04), 2021,
