geomagnetic as well as geographic coordinates; compositions such as O, O,, NO, N(4S), N(2D), O+, O,+, N+, NO+, N+, Ne.

We have also obtained meridional wind variations from the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with ther-
mosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X), a self-consistent general circulation model, that fully couples the chemistry and
dynamics, and calculates the 3D temperature, ionospheric structures, composition, and wind, from the surface up to 500-700 km in
altitude depending on geomagnetic and solar activities (Liu et al., 2010, 2018). The model inputs include solar spectral irradiance,
and high-latitude ionospheric inputs, similar to the TIEGCM while the outputs are the 1on and electron densities and temperatures,
neutral winds and 10n drifts (zonal, meridional and vertical), Pederson and Hall conductivities, and compositions (O, O,, NO, H).

The high-resolution (11-minute) interplanetary and SYM-H data used in this work are obtained from the OMNI database
(https://ommiweb.gstc.nasa.gov/) of SPDF, GSFC NASA, the K, and A, while the Equatorial Electrojet (EEJ) data are obtained
from the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, Mumbai. The strengths of EEJ are computed by taking the differences of the horizontal
(H) component (AH) of the Earth’s magnetic field at Alibag (18.6°N, 72.9°E geographic, dip angle: 26.4°, an off-equatorial station),
from that at Tirunelveli (8.7°N, 77.7°E geographic, dip angle: 1.7°, a dip equatorial station). The AH represents daytime instanta-
neous H values corrected for the nighttime base values of H. The SuperMag Auroral Electrojet (SME) data are obtained from the
SuperMag website (https://supermag.jhuapl.edu/) while the global thermospheric O/N, ratio maps are obtained from the Global Ul-
traViolet Imager (GU VI) onboard the Thermosphere-lonosphere-Mesosphere-Energetics-Dynamics (TIMED) spacecraft hosted by
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) website (http://guvitimed.jhuapl.edu/guvi-galleryl3on2). We
have also obtained International GNSS Service (IGS) GPS TEC data, available at http://garner.ucsd.edu/pub/rinex/, for the stations
Hyderabad (17.41°N, 78.55°E, geographic; dip angle: 21.69°) and Bengaluru (13.02°N, 77.50°E, geographic; dip angle: 11.78%).

3.1. Sources of the geomagnetic storms

According to the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
forecasts (https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/), an X1-class flare, from the Active Region (AR) 2887 at 15:35 UT on October 28, 2021,
caused an R3 (strong) level radio blackout. This flare event, having a CME-related signature to it, was the cause of an S1 (minor)
radiation storm that began at 17:40 UT on the same day. A minor level geomagnetic storm started around 22:00 UT on October 30,
2021, as a result of this CME interacting with the geomagnetic field.

Following this event that caused a weak geomagnetic storm on October 30-31, 2021, several CMESs erupted from the Sun, with
a few of them being Earth-directed, during the period between November 01 and 02, 2021. The source region, of these CMEs,
was the southwest area of the Sun which included a C4-class flare from the same AR 2887, erupting at 21:33 UT on November
01, 2021. This event was followed by a full halo CME, from AR 2891 (near the center disk of the Sun) at 03:01 UT on November
02, 2021, related to an M1-class flare that had caused an R1 (minor) level radio blackout. The anticipated Earth-directed CME
was observed, by the NOAA Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, as an interplanetary shock at 19:42 UT on
November 03, 2021. The CME arrived at Earth in the form of an impulse observed by the GOES-16 satellite, and the ground-based
magnetometers at 19:57 UT, thus causing a G3 (strong) level geomagnetic storm by 23:59 UT on the same day. This G3 level storm
was preceded by a G1 (minor) level storm at 21:24 UT and a G2 (moderate) level storm at 21:46 UT on November 03, 2021. The
geomagnetic storm persisted up to around 13:00 UT on November 04, 2021.

It 1s important to note that the occurrence of interacting CMEs plays a crucial role in the geoffectivity. In the heliosphere,
these interactions evolve in a non-linear manner. In general, if two CMESs get launched in the same direction, the spatiotemporal
