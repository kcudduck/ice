enhanced in an ICME sheath region. On the other hand, the MC region 1s characterized by a slow rotation of the magnetic field and
much lower values of proton temperature (Zurbuchen & Richardson, 2006; Rout et al., 2018).

Geomagnetic disturbances begin when the north-south (B,) component of the frozen-in Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF),
carried by the solar wind, turns and remains southward, causing strong reconnection with the geomagnetic field (Dungey, 1961;
Gonzalez & Tsurutani, 1987; Tsurutani et al., 1988; Gonzalez et al., 1994). Following this phenomenon, the penetration of magne-
tospheric convection electric fields from the high latitudes to the low- and equatorial latitudes occurs which 1s known as the Prompt
Penetration of Electric Field (PPEF) (Vasyliunas, 1970). Studies have shown that the equivalent current system, associated with
the PPEF, has a few minutes to about 3-4 hours of average lasting periods (Nishida, 1968a b). The PPEF has been shown to have
significant effects on the low-to-equatorial latitude electrodynamics (Fejer et al., 1983; Spiro et al., 1988; Fejer & Scherliess, 1997).
Furthermore, at the poles and the higher latitudes, the Auroral Electrojet (AE) currents transfer heat energy to the neutral gas by the
Joule heating process (Ahn et al., 1983). These currents, via the process of momentum transfer, cause changes in the circulation
of the neutral wind in and around the sub-auroral thermosphere. As a result, the Disturbance Dynamo Electric Field (DDEF) plays
a role 1n the equatorward transportation of plasma from the higher to the lower latitudes (Blanc & Richmond, 1980; Scherliess &
Fejer, 1997; Fuller-Rowell et al., 2002). This DDEF 1s opposite (westward during daytime and eastward during nighttime) in nature
to the PPEF and 1s a long-lasting process that lasts for a few days after the storm onset. During such periods, the DDEF modulates
low-latitude electrodynamics significantly in comparison to the quiet-time variations.

The Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) characterizes the ionosphere over the low-latitude regions of the globe. The EIA gets
developed at the northern and southern crests around +15 — 20° magnetic latitude mainly due to the removal of plasma from around
the equator by the upward E X B drift and partly due to the diffusion of plasma along the field lines from higher altitudes (Appleton,
1946; Balan et al., 2018). The daily variation of this EIA and hence the electron density or the Total Electron Content (TEC) over
the low-latitude regions are due to the variations in the electric fields and the thermospheric winds (Abdu et al., 1990).

Several researchers (Abdu (1997); Ngwira et al. (2012); Astafyeva et al. (2015); Nava et al. (2016); Rodriguez-Zuluaga et al.
(2016); Chakraborty et al. (2020c); Chakraborty & Chakrabarty (2023) and references therein) have studied the response of the
ionosphere to strong geomagnetic storms over different longitude sectors throughout the globe. However, there have been only
a few studies that address the response of the ionosphere to weak-to-moderate geomagnetic storms, often ignored because of the
expectation of negligible alterations 1n the ionospheric electrodynamics over daily variations. The study by (Buresova et al., 2014)
showed that geomagnetic storms of moderate intensity are capable of causing greater effects on the mid-latitude ionosphere while
the study by (Li et al., 2012) showed the observations of large ionospheric variations during a weak geomagnetic storm. A recent
study by (Chakraborty et al., 2020a; Chakraborty & Datta, 2020) brought forward similar observations of anomalous enhancements
in the TEC over the low-latitude regions of the Indian longitude sector. However, studies dedicated to low-latitude responses,
around the EIA region, during geomagnetically weak as well as strong conditions, under the influence of an ICME-MC or sheath
region, are sparse.

The motivation for this work comes from the fact that whether a stronger IMF condition in terms of higher magnitude (due
to different subsets of ICMEs) and subsequent enhancement in ring current (observed as Symmetric (SYM)-H decreases), would
always necessarily mean a stronger response of the low-latitude ionosphere. This study shows the anomalous response of the
ionosphere over a low-latitude region in the Indian sector under a weak geomagnetic storm (October 31, 2021) and compares the
same under a stronger geomagnetic storm (November 04, 2021) due to MC-like and ICME-driven sheath regions. The present
investigation brings forward an anomalous case where for an ICME to be geoeflective, especially up to the point of perturbing the
