Fig. 6. Meridional wind (m/s) variations (positive signifying poleward-directed wind) from WACCM-X during October 31 (blue) and November 04 (red), 2021.

Days of 2021 | PRN 3 | PRN 6 | TIEGCM
October 28 43.73 | 42.55 16.68

of the low-latitude ionosphere on October 31, 2021. Despite TIEGCM’s consistency in reproducing ionospheric-thermospheric
conditions, the discrepancies observed between the model outputs and the observed data for these three cases could be attributed
as follows. The TIEGCM has dependencies on the solar radio flux (F10.7, s.f.u) with either the K, index or the combination of the
three IMF components, the solar wind velocity, and density. For the case of October 28, the F10.7 was comparatively higher (110.3)
than that on October 31 (101.2), while the other parameters were comparable. As a result, we observed a slightly higher variation
of TEC on October 28 than on October 31, 2021. Further, the model 1s expected to show the highest variations on November 04,
2021, as the solar wind parameters as well as the K, values are higher compared to the other two days. Hence we see an overall rise
in the TEC variation on that day. As our observations show an anomalous (strong ionospheric responses under weak conditions)
case, therefore, incorporation of such types of anomalous cases and the corresponding ionospheric responses, in the model, could be
beneficial and valuable to the space sciences community in terms of the improvements of the model’s performance and enhancing
its predictive capabilities.

Figure 8|has been plotted to understand the effects of the ICME-driven MC and the sheath structures on the low latitude 1ono-
sphere on October 31 and November 04, 2021. In this figure, panels (a) and (c¢) are the same as the ones plotted in Figures |3|and[4]
the only difference here being variation has been shown with respect to LT. The shaded region in grey designates the LT hours from
08:00 to 16:00. Panels (b) and (d) show the variations of the residual EEJ and the time lag corrected IMF B,. The residual EEJ 1s
a simple subtraction of quiet-time variation (blue) from the individual day variation (red). The IMF B, variation, which 1s shifted
to the bow-shock nose, from the spacecraft at the Lagrangian point-LL1 has been further shifted to the ionosphere for a one-to-one
