IMF B, magnitude and fluctuations (+/-) 1s something very important for ionospheric responsivity forecasting.

Further, in a study by (Borovsky & Shprits, 2017), they show that the Disturbance storm time (Dst) or SYM-H index may not
be considered a good proxy to estimate the strength and subsequent geoeftectivity. They argued that the Dst index was unable
to capture various physical processes in the MI system (particle precipitation, Joule heating, ionospheric outflow, thermospheric
density variations, radiation belts’ state, etc.) under geomagnetically active conditions. Therefore, in agreement with their study, the
SYM-H in the present case was not able to determine the geoeffectivity of the ICME events where IMF B, polarity had been stable
inside the MC-like structure and fluctuating in the sheath region. Under such cases, the penetration electric field (related to the
solar wind and the magnetic field dynamics as given in equation 3) perturbations become an important proxy for the geoeffectivity
evaluation (see Rout et al. (2018) and references therein).

where, V,, 1s the solar wind velocity, Br 1s the magnetic field strength and 6 1s the angle between the IMF and the geomagnetic
field.

Furthermore, it 1s to be noted that magnetic sheaths are, in general, associated with Alfvenic fluctuations in the magnetic field and
as a consequence, cause fluctuating PPEF, which can often be responsible for stronger ionospheric response. However, this is not
the case in the present study. A few recent studies (Hui et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2023) show that a combination of multiple drivers
can also generate disproportionate ionospheric impact during geomagnetic storms. Therefore, factors including the background
ionospheric condition, meridional wind, etc. can never be neglected and hence are already discussed in this study. It 1s from this
deduction that the major inference drawn in the present work that the non-fluctuating Bz, for a sufficient interval of time, due
to the presence of an ICME-driven MC-like region, 1s responsible for generating stable and consistent penetration effects for the
strengthening of the low-latitude electrodynamics, despite the storm being weak, 1s important and merits attention.

Lastly, identifying such types of events along with the corresponding responses of the ionosphere, as shown in the present study,
