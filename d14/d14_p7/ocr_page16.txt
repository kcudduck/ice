4. Discussion

Before proceeding with the discussion of the physical mechanism that had caused the observed anomalous enhancement of the
low-latitude 1onosphere during the weaker events, it 1s important to rule out the effects of substorm-induced electric fields and
compositional changes on the low-latitude electrodynamics and ionization.

In Figure [4] one can observe the occurrence of a CEJ that restricts the development of the fountain on November 04, 2021,
and hence no significant enhancements in the 1onization on that day. This could be attributed to the fact that the substorm-induced
electric field (Kikuchi et al. (2003) and references therein) associated with the SME (Figure 9) showing much higher values of
around 3250 nT, meant the possibility of much stronger substorm effects on that day. Substorms have the capability of creating
reversed electric fields, thereby causing an overshielding condition over the low latitudes. This in turn prevents the increase or
strengthening of the EEJ and the corresponding ionization over the northern crest of EIA. On the contrary, during the weaker event,
we observed a comparatively lower SME (almost one-third of that observed on November 04, 2021) value which would not be
capable of perturbing the low-latitude 1onospheric electrodynamics during October 31, 2021.

Further, under storm-time conditions, Joule heating and ion drag forcing affect the morphology of the coupled 1onosphere-
thermosphere system. Upwelling of species (molecules like N, and O,) 1s caused when the polar upper atmosphere gets heated
up. These molecular-rich gases get extended towards the equator due to the ionospheric convection and forces due to the gradient
in pressure. This heating effect at the poles induces global wind circulation, causing downwelling of the molecular-rich gases to
the lower latitudes, thereby reducing the loss rate of O+ 1ons in the F-region ionosphere over the low latitudes. This causes a
positive storm effect observed as enhancements in the F-region electron density. On the other hand, the negative ionospheric storm
phenomenon 1s observed as reductions or depletions 1n the electron density (Fuller-Rowell et al. (1994, 1996); Burns et al. (1995);
Field et al. (1998); Balan et al. (2009, 2010); Kil et al. (2011); Ngwira et al. (2012); Astafyeva et al. (2015) and references therein).
However, any such effects on the 10nization over the observed station due to compositional changes can be ruled out from Figure
The O/N, values over the whole Indian region showed no significant changes that could have affected in terms of enhancements
(depletions) in the 10nization over the northern crest of EIA as a manifestation of positive (negative) storm effects during October
31 (November 04), 2021. We further add Figure|11|showing the O/N, map on a quiet day (October 28, 2021) as a reference.

Now in Figure|[2] one can observe the geomagnetic storm to be much stronger on November 04 in comparison to that on October
31, 2021. Here we observe a fluctuating IMF B, between southward and northward orientations as a result of the presence of
the sheath region. Although the IMF B, had been fluctuating during this period, the magnitude of the same had been higher and
as a result, we observed growth in the ring current and a strong geomagnetic storm condition prevailed. However, this aspect
of a stronger magnitude of the southward IMF component alone was not able to cause any geoeflectivity over the low-latitude
ionosphere on that day.

In contrast, for the much weaker event on October 31, when the magnitude of IMF B, had been almost half, due to a steady, non-
fluctuating IMF B,, we observed significant changes over the low-latitude ionosphere. Hence, it becomes clear in the present study
that 1t 1s the presence of a non-fluctuating southward B,, for a sufficient interval of time, that was able to create a non-fluctuating
or a stable (or DC) prompt penetration electric field that in turn assisted in the strengthening of the low-latitude electrodynamics
and hence a greater 10nospheric response during the weaker events. This aspect 1s observed in Figure 6) where during the interval
of 08:00-16:00 LT, the residual EEJ had strong positive values that were able to assist in the development of stronger plasma
distribution over the crest region. On the other hand, the AC penetration caused as a result of the sheath region and subsequent
fluctuating IMF B, restricted the growth of EEJ strength over these LT hours. Therefore, it 1s evident that competition between the
