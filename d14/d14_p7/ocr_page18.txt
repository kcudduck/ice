to perform fruitful statistical inferences, 1s non-trivial. However, identifying more such cases would be helpful for the space science
community to perform a comprehensive and holistic study of the 1onospheric responses to varying severity of space weather events
in the future. As a follow-up to this work, we will be performing statistical studies as well as investigating the periodicity of the
IMF B, and penetration electric field fluctuations to be able to tell how slow/fast these sheath region fluctuations have to be, to be
geoeflective.
5. Summary
This work was directed to reveal that a weaker geomagnetic storm occurring on October 31, 2021, had caused a greater 1ono-
spheric response, over the low-latitude region in the Indian sector, compared to a much stronger geomagnetic event of November
04, 2021. The presence of an ICME-driven sheath region, that had caused a fluctuating penetration electric field over the equa-
torial electrodynamics, was shown to be responsible for the prevention of the development of strong and consistent levels of EEJ
strength. This restricted the otherwise expected plasma enhancements over the low-latitude ionosphere during such periods. This
investigation brought forward, that for this particular case study and under poleward neutral wind variations, it was neither the
storm intensity (SYM-H) nor the IMF B, magnitude, but the occurrence of the non-fluctuating B, (for a sufficient interval of time),
due to the presence of an ICME-driven MC-like region, responsible for generating stable and consistent penetration effects for the
strengthening of the low-latitude electrodynamics, despite the storm being weak. This case study 1s a path forward for the devel-
opment of state-of-the-art space weather forecast systems, for reliable predictions related to low- and equatorial electrodynamics
under geomagnetically active conditions, by incorporating the time duration for which the IMF remains completely southward
without any fluctuations.
