Fig. 7. TIEGCM simulation results showing the TEC variations over Ahmedabad on a quiet day (October 28, 2021: green curve), on October 31, 2021 (blue curve),

mapping of the same with the residual EEJ variation. The procedure followed in this work for obtaining the time lag corrected IMF
B, has been thoroughly explained in (see Chakrabarty et al. (2005) and references therein). Looking into panel (b), one can observe
a fluctuating (or AC) penetration electric field, thereby causing a net positive effect on the EEJ and a corresponding low-latitude
ionospheric response 1n terms of TEC enhancements. On the other hand, panel (d) clearly shows the effects of AC penetration fields
and the subsequent inhibition effect in the development of the EEJ and negligible effects on the low-latitude TEC variations.

Next, to rule out effects on the observations due to the substorm-induced electric fields and the compositional changes, Figures|9)
and|10]are shown. In Figure|9| we show the variations of the SME (nT) index, for the entire analysis period. The value of SME can
be observed to show a rise up to 750 nT around 23:30 UT on October 30, 2021, and a second rise, higher in magnitude (about 1200
nT) around 13:30 UT on November 31, 2021, can be observed in the figure. The SME values start rising again and peak with a
value around 3250 nT on November 04, 2021. This suggests that the substorm-induced electric field did not affect the low-latitude
ionosphere on the weaker event day significantly.

Furthermore, in Figure 10] we show the thermospheric O/N; ratio maps observed by the GUVI onboard TIMED spacecraft on
October 31, and November 04, 2021. An overall value of around 0.75 throughout the Indian region, suggests no significant changes
in the O/N, values over these regions on both event days. Further explanations of these results will be discussed later.
