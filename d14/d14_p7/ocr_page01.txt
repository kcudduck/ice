Od Abstract
2 This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic condi-
ay tions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection
on (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Con-
A tent (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06°N, 72.54°E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20°), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization
¢) Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navi-
’ A gation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to
— the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It 1s shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplan-
Ne etary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it 1s the non-fluctuating
southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind vari-
QO p gp p
i ations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present
investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining
Is a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.

>< system mostly following the Coronal Mass Ejection(s) (CMESs) from the Sun directed toward the Earth. These ICMEs have certain
cS features (MacQueen, 1980; Klein & Burlaga, 1982; Burlaga et al., 1982) such as the sheath and the Magnetic Cloud (MC) regions.
The sheath region, bounded by the shock front and formed ahead of the ICMEs, has the characteristic wherein the plasma 1s turbulent
and highly compressed. The magnetic field, the proton temperature, proton density, dynamic flow pressure, and the velocity are all
