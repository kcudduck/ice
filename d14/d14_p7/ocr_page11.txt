Days of October and November 2021
Fig. 5. IGS GPS TEC variation over Hyderabad (HYDE, Top) and Bengaluru (IISC, Bottom) observed from October 29 to November 05, 2021. The red curves
show the observed VTEC while the blue curves show the variation of the average of the three quietest days.
chemistry and the dynamics from the surface to about 700 km altitude, and 1s capable of reproducing the 1onosphere-thermosphere
state, as well as the variabilities, of the whole atmosphere, on an hourly to daily time scales due to both geomagnetic and lower
atmosphere forcing, the general trends are expected to be similar to observations (Liu et al., 2010, 2018).

Next, Figure 7] has been shown to check whether the observed anomalous behavior is captured by a global circulation model.
The TIEGCM 1s used to obtain TEC variations on a quiet day (October 28, 2021: green curve), the day (October 31, 2021: blue
curve) when successive weak storms had occurred, and the day (November 04, 2021: red curve) when a strong geomagnetic storm
had occurred. The inputs given to the model are the F10.7 and the K, index. The TIEGCM 1s known to produce consistent results
in the coupled 10nosphere-thermosphere system, however, in the present case, it produces just the opposite behavior. Table|I|shows
the observed diurnal maximum TEC as well as the model output on each of these three days. When we compare the variation of
TEC on October 31 and November 04 with October 28 (quiet day), we note that lower TEC 1s observed on October 31 and higher
TEC 1s observed on 04 November. The overall observations show that the TIEGCM 1s unable to capture the enhanced response
