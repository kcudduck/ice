Fig. 3. Variations of NavIiC VTEC for PRN 3 (panels (a), (b), (¢), (d)), for PRN 6 (panels (e), (1), (g), (h)), along with the EEJ variations (panels (1), (3), (k), (1))
during the period from October 29 to November 01, 2021. The red curves show the observed VTEC and EEJ variations while the
blue curves show the variation of the average of the three quietest days. The black horizontal bars signify the 1-sigma level.
Next, Panels (1), (3), (k), and (I) in Figures|3|and|4| show the corresponding EEJ variations from October 29- November 01, 2021,
and November 02-05, 2021 respectively. On October 31, 2021, there was an observation of enhancement in the EEJ values over
the quiet-time variation (panel (0) in Figure 13). However, on observing the same on November 04, 2021 (panel (0) of Figure 4),
the occurrences of counter-electrojets (CEJ) can be observed which might have restricted the development of the plasma fountain
over the crest region on that day, thereby, showing no significant TEC enhancement in comparison to the weaker events. This CEJ
was caused as a result of sudden reversals in the IMF B, (see panel (a) of Figure (2) orientation from southward-to-northward during
certain intervals of time as a result of the presence of ICME-sheath region. Also from Figure [2] we can observe the main phase
of the weak storm on October 31, which started at 02:36 LT and ended at 10:00 LT. This is also the time when we observe the
strengthening of the EEJ over this sector, which 1n turn strengthens the TEC over the crest regions at around 14:30 LT. In the case
of the strong event on November 04, the main phase occurred from around 02:30 LT to 17:45 LT, covering the entire daytime of
November 04. However, we can observe strong CEJ and hence not so-prominent strengthening of the plasma fountain over the
crest region and subsequent lower values of TEC on that day. Therefore, it becomes important to note that although the magnitude
of the southward IMF had caused a strong geomagnetic storm, evident from the intensification of the ring current (lower SYM-H
values), it failed to be significantly geoeflective due to the absence of a long-duration southward IMF B, during this period.
Next, Figure 5] shows the GPS TEC variations over the stations Hyderabad (HYDE, Top Panel) and Bengaluru (IISC, Bottom
Panel) for the entire analysis period between October 29 and November 05, 2021. The red curves show the VTEC variations on
the individual days while the blue curves show the variations of the average of the three quietest days. Looking into the top panel,
for HYDE, we can observe the diurnal maximum of TEC (red curve) on October 31 (third bell curve) to be about 68 TECU which
1s about 16 TECU above the quiet-time variation (blue curve). The variation on November 04 (second last bell curve), showed the
same at around 65 TECU. Looking into the bottom panel, for IISC, we see that the diurnal maximum on October 31 and November
04 1s around 62-63 TECU. From these panels, we can say that there 1s an increase in the diurnal maximum of TEC (from 62 TECU
at IISC to about 68 TECU at HYDE) on October 31, as one approaches the EIA crest (Bengaluru to Hyderabad). This can be
