Figure 1|shows the Ionospheric Pierce Point (IPP) latitude-longitude (geographic and geomagnetic) plot of the NavIC satellite
footprints with respect to the receiver placed at Ahmedabad. Here the two satellites (or PRNs) 3 and 6 of NavIC are considered
in the analysis as they are GEOs. PRN 2, also being a GEO, was excluded from the analysis as it contained data gaps during the
analysis period. It 1s also to be noted that the IPP separation between PRNs 3 and 6 1s about 4.5° pointing to the fact that the
ionospheric plasma volume intercepted by PRN 3 1s different from that observed by PRN 6.

Fig. 1. Plot showing IPP (geographic and geomagnetic) latitude (Lat) and longitude (Lon) footprints of NavIC satellite PRNs 2-7 over Ahmedabad. PRNs 2, 3, and
6 are GEOs while PRNs 4 5, and 7 are GSOs. The GEO PRNs 3 and 6 used in this work are marked separately in ovals.

Next, we obtained the simulation runs using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Thermosphere-Ionosphere-
Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) hosted by the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). The
TIEGCM 1s a non-linear, first-principles, and three-dimensional (3D) depiction of the terrestrial ionosphere and thermosphere
coupled as a system. The model consists self-consistent solution of the mid-latitude as well as the low-latitude dynamo fields.
TIEGCM solves basic physical equations: the continuity, the energy, and the momentum, using a fourth-order, semi-implicit
finite difference method on individual pressure surfaces in a vertical grid, for the neutral and the 10on species at a typical time-
step of 2 minutes. Several studies (Richmond et al., 2003; Vichare & Richmond, 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2012; Richmond et al.,
2015; Richmond & Fang, 2015; Maute et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022; Chakraborty, 2022) show the capability of this model to
understand the electrodynamic processes in the ionosphere, thus making it an ideal simulation platform closely reproducing the
coupled 1onosphere-thermosphere system of Earth. The standard low-resolution grid parameters in the model are the latitudinal
extent from -87.5° to +87.5° and longitudinal extent from -180° to +180°; pressure level (altitude-wise) from -7 to +7 1n steps of 4
having the lower boundary at around 97 km and upper boundary around 500-700 km (variation as per solar activity condition). The
model inputs are F10.7 (daily solar radio flux) along with either the K, index or the IMFs B,, B,, B, the solar wind velocity, and
solar wind density. The outputs from this model, specified in all three spatial and temporal dimensions, are the height of pressure
surfaces (cm); neutral, electron, and 10n temperatures (K); the zonal, meridional, and vertical neutral winds (m/s); potential in
