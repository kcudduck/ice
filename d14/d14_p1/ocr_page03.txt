Colaba (~10°) and Tihany (~46°), both observatories were located within 10° of the
lowest limit of the aurora observing locations for the corresponding event [Green and
Boardsen, 2006; Pallamraju and Chakrabarti, 2003].
This paper 1s dedicated to the analysis of the geospace disturbances during the event on
29 October 2003 for the interval when it can be compared to the Carrington storm, 1.e.,
the first hours after the sudden commencement (SC) observed in Dst and SYM-H
indices. After the analysis of the event with the large data sets available, we extrapolate
the results to the Carrington storm, taking into account the limited data available for this
event. Section 2 describes the discovery of a Carrington-like event in local magnetic
records. In Section 3 we analyse the geospace disturbances during the event on 29
October 2003. Finally, Section 4 1s dedicated to discussion and Section 5 to
Conclusions.
2. Discovering a Carrington-like profile in local magnetic records
After a careful visual scrutiny of measurements recorded by INTERMAGNET
geomagnetic observatories at mid-latitudes during extreme storms, we found that the
profile of the horizontal magnetic field component intensity measured on 29 October
2003 by some magnetic observatories in Europe was similar to that recorded at Colaba
on 2 September 1859. Specifically Tihany observatory, in Hungary, recorded magnetic
field variations which closely resemble the Carrington storm (Figure 1): the local timing
of the large drop in H was similar (~ 9 - 10 MLT) -which 1s the onset of the terrestrial
disturbance-, the short duration of the drop in H was comparable (< 1 hour), and the
recovery to quiet time levels was extremely fast (< 1 hour) and also similar in shape.
Nevertheless, the maximum disturbance 1s just half the intensity (almost 800 nT).
