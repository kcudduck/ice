Figure 2 shows the terrestrial disturbance during the first hours of the storm event on 29
October 2003 (see Table 1 for geographical and magnetic coordinates of the
observatories). Measurements of the horizontal magnetic field component recorded at
mid-latitude (~40Â° MLat) observatories spread in longitude appear in Figure 2a. Panels
from top to bottom are: SUA, IRT, FRN, BSL, and SPT (increasing in MLong). Figure
2b shows, for the same interval as Figure 2a, the SYM-H and Dst indices (top panel),
and the horizontal magnetic field component recorded at the four low-latitude
observatories involved 1n the computation of the Dst index: HER, KAK, HON, and
SIG.

Regarding the SYM-H index, the first magnetic signature of the storm 1s a sudden
commencement of approximately 80 nT (solid vertical line at 06:12 UT), which can be
also observed in the Dst index. After the SC, SYM-H index decreases to a minimum
value of -432 nT at 23:03 UT on 30 October (not shown in the figure) in a three-step
profile. The SC signature 1s commonly related to an enhancement of the magnetopause
current, which 1s expected to be observed across the globe. Therefore, we proceed to
carefully analyse magnetic records at different locations.

First we compare the measurements of the horizontal component from a chain of mid-
latitude magnetic observatories spread in longitude in order to provide a sample all
around the globe. The magnetic trace at IRT, located in the mid-latitude afternoon
sector, shows an increase of just less than 70 nT at SC onset. However, larger
enhancements of ~120 nT appear at FRN and BSL at the SC. FRN and BSL, in the pre-
and mid-night sector located, show a positive change which reaches ~300 nT and ~350
nT respectively, about one hour after SC. SPT and SUA, located in the dawn and pre-
noon sector, show different behaviour: instead of a positive disturbance, a rapid
