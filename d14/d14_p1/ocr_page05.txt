decrease appears at the time of the SC leading to negative depression development
similar to the Carrington event and to that shown in Figure 1 for THY, herein after H-
spike.
The intensity of the disturbance decreases rapidly when moving in longitude from dawn
(where THY 1s located at the peak of the H-spike) (~25 %, 5 degrees away from THY at
SUA, and ~40 %, 20Â° further away at SPT). These observations reveal that the extreme
drop 1n H recorded at some observatories on 29 October 2003 was actually a very local
drop in the dawn sector.
At low latitudes, we have checked the magnetic traces for this event at the four
observatories involved in computing the Dst index (HER, KAK, HON and SJG). The
SC appears at HON, KAK and SJG but 1s not noticeable at HER (in the dawn sector).
Then, the disturbance during the first two hours after the SC depends strongly on the
sector at low latitudes as previously shown for mid-latitudes. The horizontal component
shows a negative depression at HER reaching a minimum value of -330 nT, while the
disturbance goes to positive values at SJG (in the after mid-night sector), reaching a
maximum value of 210 nT at the time of the maximum disturbance at HER. KAK and
HON show smaller disturbances, but also opposite (positive in HON and negative in
KAK). The result of an average of all these measurements in the computation of the Dst
index 1s the almost complete disappearance of the disturbance during these two hours
after the SC. The higher temporal resolution of SYM-H index does not prevent from
missing the disturbance of these first two hours after the SC, as this index 1s also
computed by averaging disturbances at different longitudes.
From the third hour to the minimum value of the disturbance at 00:33 UT on 30
October, a slower decrease of the horizontal component 1s a common signature at all
