1. Introduction
Major disturbances of the magnetosphere, or geomagnetic storms, are a consequence of
solar activity, and represent a serious hazard to our technology dependent society. On 2
September 1859, the Colaba observatory measured the most extreme geomagnetic
disturbance ever recorded at low and mid latitudes. Although at that time the magnetic
observatories used to produce Dst were not 1n operation, the Dst minimum value for this
event was first estimated by Siscoe [1979] about —2000 nT. More recently, Lakhina et
al. [2005] and Cid et al. [2013] provided new estimations of —1760 nT and —685 nT,
respectively. In any case, the so-called Carrington storm 1s ranked, according to the Dst
index, as the most extreme geomagnetic storm ever recorded.
A large amount of guesswork that has been done concerning the Carrington storm:
inferring the estimation of the minimum Dst index just from one observatory [Akasofu
and Kamide, 2005; Cid et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006; Siscoe et al., 2006; Siscoe, 1979;
Tsurutani et al., 2003, 2005]; estimating the flare intensity from its ground effect
[Cliver and Svalgaard, 2004; Clarke et al., 2010; Boteler, 2006]; identifying the
interplanetary trigger (ICME, sheath, successive ejections) [Tsurutani et al., 2003,
20035; Siscoe et al., 2006; Manchester et al., 2006]; discussing the relevance of
ionospheric versus magnetospheric effects on the disturbance [Akasofu and Kamide,
2005; Siscoe et al., 2006; Green and Boardsen, 2006; Tsurutani et al., 2005], etc.
In October 2003, during the first Halloween storm, Tihany magnetic observatory (THY:
MLat 45.87°, MLong 100.06°) in Hungary recorded a geomagnetic disturbance with an
extraordinarily similar profile to that recorded at Colaba in 1839, but this time with a
large dataset available from modern solar, interplanetary and terrestrial surface
observatories. Although there 1s a large difference between the magnetic latitude of
