magnetic observatories analysed at low- and mid-latitude. Therefore, Dst and SYM-H
indices are good indicators of the disturbance for this time.
Measurements by the DMSP satellite (F13) at 17:45 local time, reported by Mannucci et
al. [2005], showed that the drift velocity at DMSP altitude (840 km) was predominantly
negative (downward) during the days 25-30 October 2003, except for three distinct
periods when the drift velocity becomes significantly upward (>70 m s™): 29 October at
06:16 UT and at 19:51-23:13 UT; and 30 October at 19:41-21:18 UT. Large FACs
were observed by CHAMP 1n the dayside in both hemispheres between ~6-8 UT [Wang
et al., 20006].
Enhancements in estimated hemispheric power index [Fuller-Rowell and Evans, 1987;
Emery et al., 2008] from POES 1n Northern hemisphere were observed from ~6 UT on
29 October until ~5 UT on 30 October, reaching up to 554.5 GW on 29 October at
07:19 UT. The hemispheric power index was enhanced again on the late hours on 30
October. These data reveal enhancement and prolonged auroral activity which was
already observed using OI 6300 A emission from Boston (48.3° MLat), which is
approximately at 30°-40° equatorward in latitude of the normal auroral precipitation
regions [Pallamraju and Chakrabarti, 2005]. NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR
SEC-88 on Halloween storms reported that aurora sightings occurred from California to
Houston to Florida. Tremendous aurora viewing was also reported from mid-Europe
and even as far south as the Mediterranean countries (~40° MLat).
4. Discussion
We report 1n this paper a geomagnetic disturbance case recorded on 29 October 2003 at
THY magnetic observatory (hereafter, C03), whose temporal profile during two days 1s
extraordinarily similar to the one recorded at Colaba in 1859 (hereafter, C59). Of course
