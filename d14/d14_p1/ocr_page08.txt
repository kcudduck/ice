1760 nT. Our results also agree with Li [2009] and Cid et al. [2014] on the relevance of
local magnetic field disturbances against a global activity level for technological
systems. Moreover, considering the very local signatures of the H-spike and the lack of
magnetic observatories covering all MLT sectors in past epochs, our outcomes also
imply that a Carrington-like event can occur more often than expected, as suggested by
Kataoka [2013].

As previously shown for low-latitude magnetic observatories, longitudinal analysis of
magnetic field measurements at mid-latitude observatories during C03 (Figure 2a)
shows negative or positive depressions depending on the local time. These depressions
happened simultaneously with auroral effects. The longitudinal variation at mid-
latitudes of the geomagnetic disturbance during CO3 H-spike can be summarized as a
day-night asymmetry peaking at dawn-noon sector and almost unnoticed in the noon-
dusk sector, although the peak disturbance due to an asymmetric ring current effect 1s
expected 1n the dusk sector [Li, 2009]. This result does not agree with Tsurutani et al.
[2003] or Li et al. [2006] which pointed out that the Hâ€”spike at Colaba was related to
the plasma injection into the nightside magnetosphere, which enhances the ring current.
However, the spike happened from ~ 9 to 10 MLT, where other currents have a major
contribution (Shi et al., 2008). Akasofu and Kamide [2005] pointed out that some
intense storms tend to have a sharp forenoon decrease of the H component, which
accompanies a greater disturbance at auroral latitudes. These signatures were previously
related to FACs by Tsuji et al. [2012] for the geomagnetic storm on 7-8 September 2002
and by Yu et al. [2010] using MHD simulations.

Love and Gannon [2010] also reported a large dawn-dusk asymmetry in low-latitude
disturbances during the November 2003 storm and during the October 2003 storm. They
proposed that these observations were the result of the superposition of magnetopause
