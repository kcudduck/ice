there are two remarkable differences among the Carrington event (C59) and the
“Carrington-like” event (C03): (1) the intensity of the disturbance in C59 1s double that
in CO3, and (2) the latitude of the magnetic observatory where the measurements were
collected, which was very low for C59 (10° MLat) and middle for CO3 (46° MLat).
However, those latitudes have a common feature: both were about 10° equatorward
from the lower latitude reported of aurora sightings for the corresponding event, which
in both cases was tar from the typical edge of the auroral oval.

Comparison between horizontal magnetic field component measurements at low-
latitude observatories during C03 (Figure 2b) reveals that the size of the disturbance in
the first two hours following the SC depends strongly on the local time of the magnetic
records, being negative in the dayside and positive in the nightside. A small increase
appeared 1n Dst or SYM-H, corresponding to the SC, and the largest disturbance (the H-
spike) disappeared in these global indices due to the averaging involved in the
computation procedure.

The problem for Dst or SYM-H which missed the largest disturbance 1s not related in
this case to the latitude of the magnetic observatories involved 1n the computation of the
indices, as it usually occurs 1n high latitude events. Computing global indices at the time
of the H-spikes from an average of H from mid-latitude observatories widely spread in
longitude also results in values close to quiet time for those indices due to the large
asymmetry in H records (extreme positive and negative disturbances are averaged out).
Therefore, global indices, commonly used for space weather purposes, based on the
mean value of the magnetic disturbance levels, as Dst and SYM-H, cannot be considered
as good proxies to quantify the disturbance, as both might miss one of the most
hazardous ground effects. This result agrees with Akasofu and Kamide [2005] that
believed that it 1s not likely that the C59 storm reached a Dst decrease of as large as
