The analysis of local magnetic records and magnetic indices during the event on 29
October 2003, when they are extrapolated to the Carrington event, led us to interesting
implications. These are the following:
1) The Dst or SYM-H indices (commonly used to assess the severity of a storm) if
calculated with multiple observatories as done today might have missed the large H-
spike recorded at Colaba during C59.
2) The very local signatures of the H-spike imply that a Carrington-like event can occur
more often than expected.
3) FACs played a major role in the H-spike in C03 and C59.
