Figure 2. Geomagnetic disturbances of the 29 October 2003 event. Panel (a) shows
measurements of the H component recorded at mid-latitude observatories. From top to
bottom: SUA, IRT, FRN, BSL, and SPT (increasing in MLong). Panel (b), from top to
bottom, displays SYM-H and Dst indices (top panel), and the H component recorded at
the four low-latitude observatories involved in the computation of the Dst index: HER,
p
KAK, HON, and SJG. Vertical solid line S marks shock discontinuity.
