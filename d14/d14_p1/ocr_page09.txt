currents and partial ring current and, even FACs. Similar evidence of magnetic changes,
confined in a narrow longitude range in the forenoon sector, and as a result with a little
contribution to the Dst index, were provided by Akasofu and Kamide [2005] for some
intense storms. Siscoe et al. [2006] and Green and Boarden [2006] already suggested
that the H-spike in C59 might have a significant auroral-ionospheric component.
Boteler [2006] pointed out that the combination of the negative depression in H at
Rome and the large positive Z excursion at Greenwich were the signatures of a large
westward electrojet at ~40° to 45° MLat, which will produce a considerable enlargement
of the auroral oval during C59. However, he concluded that there was no evidence that
it went far enough equatorward to contribute to the magnetic variation recorded at
Colaba. More recently Cliver and Dietrich [2013], comparing C59 and the geomagnetic
storm mn May 1921, indicated that an auroral negative depression contributed to the
negative H-spike in the Colaba trace during C59.

During C03, the availability of a large number of magnetic records spread through the
globe has allowed us to go further in these suggestions regarding the auroral-ionosphere
component 1n magnetograms and to propose a major role for FACs in CO3 and by
extrapolation during C59. Extending what Siscoe et al. [2006] pointed out for the effect
of 1onospheric currents involved in C59 to FACs, we conclude that the effect of FACs
affecting a magnetogram at a latitude as low as 10° 1s also an exceptional aspect of the
storm.

The H-spike at Colaba in C59 (considered up to now as a Dst-spike) was addressed by
simulation assuming solar wind conditions with very intense (~ 60 nT) and short time
duration southern B; and an additional extreme enhancement of the solar wind density
(~1800 cm™) after the negative B; [Li et al., 2006]. Similar profile shapes to the Li et al.
