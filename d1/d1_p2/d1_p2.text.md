  of Au. Movement of the compressor in the air gap between the SE-TENG instigates a change in the electric field (~      E) between the compressor and SE-TENG,
  resulting in a displacement current of two regimes: approach phase and the departure phase (bottom). Between these two phases of the compressor motion,
  three key charging events take place: CE, CI, and ESD. CE is caused by the transfer of charge between the contacting materials, CI is influenced by the re-
  distribution of surface charge resulting in an output current and ESD is caused due to the breakdown of air in the gap, creating an ionised conductive channel
  resulting in a loss of surface charge; these effects combined produce a triboelectric signal.

  Results and Discussion

  Quantifying Contributions from Contact Separation Events in
  TENGs

  To quantify contributions to electrical signals from CE, CI, and
  ESD, a TENG testing set-up was used, as shown in Figure S1(a–
  b). In brief (see experimental for full details), this set-up
  primarily consisted of a dynamic mechanical compressor (for
  contact separation), load cell (force measurements), and a
  picoammeter (current/charge measurements) providing the
  precise control of the z-motion with time (at a velocity of
  1 mm s 1) and current (with resolution down to 10 fA).
      Initially, it was important to identify the charging compo-
  nents produced during each contact separation cycle, as shown
  in Figure 2 (a–b) using a single-electrode TENG (SE-TENG). Here,
  contact separation was conducted with a controlled application

  as an indicator to confirm the presence of an ESD in a
  triboelectric signal. Furthermore, after comparing the peak –
  peak charge output with the signal that exhibited no spike
  current due to ESDs (Figure 4(d-blue)), it was clear that a charge
  loss of roughly 4.53 nC can be observed. Comparing 6 cycles
  (across three different samples), a significant loss of surface
  charge (~17 %) was observed when ESDs take place, as shown
  in Figure S4. A thorough analysis conducted by extending the
  cycle range to 78, across three SE-TENGs indicated that a mean
  surface charge loss of 26.06 � 5.15 % was observed because of
  ESD events. Importantly, this means that a triboelectric signal
  produced with the aid of CE and CI undergoes an approx-
  imately 26 % reduction in surface charge over its life span.



  Minimising the Influence of ESDs in TENGs

  The preceding sections provided a set of procedures that can
  be used for the quantification of the separate contributions to
  current and charge in SE-TENGs from CE, CI, and ESD.
      Here, control experiments were explored to optimise the
  interference levels of ESDs in triboelectric signals. These
  procedures will aid in critical testing protocols for SE-TENGs
  that can be utilised to benchmark their energy generation
  proficiency for various applications.


  Controlling the Velocity of the Friction Layer

  of the velocity of the friction layer in mitigating electrostatic
  interferences in SE-TENGs.
