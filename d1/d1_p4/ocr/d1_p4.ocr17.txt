Scheme of electrospray ionization in a mass-spectrometer Scheme of ion emission from ice structure
1) The emission of a jet of liquid drops under high voltage 1) Spraying of particles when electric field strength at
2) Evaporation of the solvent from droplets, leading to more ice tips overcomes Rayleigh limit
and more charged droplets 2) Sublimation of particles leading to more and more
3) Disintegration of droplets when charge exceeds the charged particles
Rayleigh limit producing a stream of charged ions 3) Disintegration of particles when charge exceeds
a) again the Rayleigh limit producing charged ions
