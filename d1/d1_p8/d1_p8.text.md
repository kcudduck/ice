                  Triboelectriﬁcation is a well-known phenomenon that commonly occurs in nature and in our
                  lives at any time and any place. Although each and every material exhibits triboelectriﬁcation,

                  its quantiﬁcation has not been standardized. A triboelectric series has been qualitatively
                  ranked with regards to triboelectric polarization. Here, we introduce a universal standard
                  method to quantify the triboelectric series for a wide range of polymers, establishing
                  quantitative triboelectriﬁcation as a fundamental materials property. By measuring the tested
                  materials with a liquid metal in an environment under well-deﬁned conditions, the proposed
                  method standardizes the experimental set up for uniformly quantifying the surface triboe-
                  lectriﬁcation of general materials. The normalized triboelectric charge density is derived to
                  reveal the intrinsic character of polymers for gaining or losing electrons. This quantitative
                  triboelectric series may serve as a textbook standard for implementing the application of
                  triboelectriﬁcation for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing.

metal can be ﬁnely adjusted by both the high-load lab jack and a linear motor. The static part has the liquid metal as the electrode. The motion part consists
of the tested sample, and it is controlled by the linear motor (b). An acrylic base is attached to the end of the linear motor. A magnet is engraved into the
acrylic base to attract another magnet engraved in the sample substrate. Each sample consists of an acrylic substrate with the magnet, electrode, and the
