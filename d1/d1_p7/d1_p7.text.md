                               Abstract | Static electrification is among the earliest of the sciences, well known to us all and
                               with widespread and important consequences. Yet, its most basic foundations remain poorly
                               understood. For example, after centuries of research, it is still not clear whether electrons,
                               ions or even bulk material transfer is responsible for the observed charging. Recent work has
                               leveraged the most advanced experimental and theoretical approaches, and has addressed the
                               phenomenon from perspectives of quantum mechanics, surface chemistry, mechanochemistry
                               and statistical physics. While the resulting findings have advanced many aspects of our
                               understanding, they have also led to the discovery of new surprises that we are only beginning
                               to appreciate. This Review addresses both recent advances and their accompanying surprises.

                              Nearly a century ago, Peter Shaw remarked in an article       New technologies based on triboelectricity have also
