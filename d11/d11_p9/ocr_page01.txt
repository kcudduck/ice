Abstract
The Gilmore model is combined with the Noble-Abel-stiffened-gas (NASG) equation of state to yield a simple
SS model to predict the expansion and collapse of spherical bubbles based on real gas thermodynamics. The
o NASG equation of state resolves the temperature inaccuracy associated with the commonly employed Tait
~ equation of state for liquids and, thus, can provide a consistent description of compressible and thermal effects
of the bubble content and the surrounding liquid during cavitation. After a detailed derivation of the proposed
= Gilmore-NASG model, the differences between the classical Gilmore-Tait model and the proposed model are
< highlighted with results of single-bubble cavitation related to bubble collapse and driven by an acoustic excitation
in frequency and amplitude regimes relevant to sonoluminescence, high-intensity focused ultrasound and shock
— wave lithotripsy. Especially for rapidly and violently collapsing bubbles, substantial differences in the bubble
@\ behaviour can be observed between the proposed Gilmore-NASG model and the classical Gilmore-Tait model.
— The ability of the Gilmore-NASG model to simultaneously predict reliable pressure and temperature values
- in gas, vapour and liquid, makes the proposed model particularly attractive for sonochemistry and biomedical
> applications.
