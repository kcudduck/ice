2. Noble-Abel-stiffened-gas equation of state 3. Gilmore-NASG model
The NASG EOS [8] combines the stiffened-gas EOS The Gilmore model [5] describes the temporal evo-
and the Noble-Abel EOS to yield an unconditionally lution of the bubble radius R by a second-order ordi-
convex EOS that includes both molecular attraction nary differential equation, given as
