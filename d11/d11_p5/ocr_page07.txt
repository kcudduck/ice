For the purpose of studying the effect of phase difference the chaotic dynam-
ics of a bubble with 4um of initial radius and 1M H z fundamental frequency,
were studied in the range of 1—3M Pa of pressure. Figure 8a shows the result-
ing bifurcation diagram. It shows that the bubble dynamics is first chaotic,
then becomes of period four regular oscillations and each of them undergoes a
period doubling bifurcation and again chaotic oscillations occur in the range
of 1.6—3M Pa. A secondary frequency with the value of 1.5M H z was applied
concomitant with the fundamental. The phase differences of pi/6, pi/2 and
3pi/4 were applied. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are presented in fig-
ures 8b — 8d respectively. As seen in figure 8b, by applying a phase difference
of pi/6 a stable region appeared in the range of about 1.6 — 2M Pa which
were chaotic before applying the secondary frequency. When we applied the
phase difference of pi/2 (figureS8c) the bubble exhibited stable period four
oscillations in the range of 1 — 1.6M Pa. As seen the oscillations are stable
in the range of about 1 —1.3M Pa of pressure which they were chaotic before
applying the technique. Figure 8d illustrates the case of applying the 3pi/4 of
phase difference. When compared with figure 8a we see that a stable region
is formed in the range of about 2 — 2.5M Pa. This domain was completely
chaotic prior to applying the dual frequency method. Also it should be noted
that the stable region in the bifurcation diagram of the bubble driven by a
single frequency source may become chaotic after applying the secondary fre-
quency. This is obvious in figures 8b and 8d.

In summary it is seen that phase difference had a distinguishable impact on
the dual frequency bubble dynamics. Different stable regions appeared cor-
responding to typical phase differences. This suggests certain phase values
can be applied to control chaotic regions of interest.

3.4 Effects of the secondary frequency on the dynamics

of a dual frequency driven bubble
In order to study the impact of the value of the secondary frequency on the
bubble dynamics, the chaotic oscillations of the bubble in the previous part
(figure 8a) were chosen. The phase difference was held constant with the
value of pi/3 while the secondary frequency was 500K Hz, 800K Hz, 2M H =
and SM Hz. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are presented in figures
9a — d, respectively. Comparing with figure 8a using a secondary frequency
of 500K Hz (figure 9a) has stabilized the first chaotic region in the range
