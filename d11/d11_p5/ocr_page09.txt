10c and 10h. In figure 10 except for 10c and 10h the oscillations have become
stable. It is also seen that this technique may arm us by the possibility to
provide oscillations of desired amplitude.
4 Conclusion
The dynamics of an acoustically driven gas bubble was studied applying the
method of chaos physics. Results indicated its rich nonlinear dynamics with
respect to variations in the control parameters of the system. A method
based on applying a dual frequency source is proposed. Simulation results
demonstrated that the proposed procedure may be able to achieve the con-
trol objective. This is possible through choosing appropriate values of the
secondary frequency and its phase difference with initial one.
