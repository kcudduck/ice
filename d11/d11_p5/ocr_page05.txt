Figures 2a —b show the bifurcation diagram and lyapunov spectrum of a bub-
ble when driven by a pressure source of 500K Pa versus frequency in the range
of 100KHz — 2M Hz. We can perceive in figure 2a intermittent occurrence
of chaotic and stable behaviors in bubble oscillations during frequency in-
crease. The transitions from stable to chaotic oscillations are through period
doubling bifurcations. The last transition to stable everlasting oscillations
occurred through a saddle node bifurcation after an inverse period doubling.
As a quantitative criterion for the comportment illustrated in figure 2a, the
lyapunov exponent spectrum was sketched in figure 2b.
The significant undesirable behavior outlined in figures 1 and 2 is oscillations
which are chaotic. To avoid these unwanted dynamical effects, it is necessary
to carry out control strategies in the system. To achieve this objective we
propose a method called "Dual frequency technique”. In the stated method
we introduced a secondary frequency employment along with the primary
driving frequency source.
In this technique, the effect of not only the secondary frequency but also
its phase difference with the basic frequency must be concomitantly taken
into consideration to get the desirable outcome. More explanation is going
to be put forward in this paper. In order to streamline the manifestation
of the method efficacy on chaotic behaviors, some chaotic zones have been
arbitrarily chosen to be exposed to the secondary frequency. For the asso-
ciated zones the dynamical behavior of the bubble was analyzed before and
after control. This is done through analyzing its bifurcation diagram and the
corresponding lyapunov spectrum. Also time series of the normalized radius
of the bubble are presented in order to reveal the stabilizing effect on the
oscillations of the bubble in certain values of the control parameter.
3.2 Possibility of controlling chaotic oscillations using
a dual frequency forcing
Starting with a completely chaotic zone for a single cavitation bubble when
the control parameter is pressure, figure 3 has been presented. The funda-
mental frequency is 200K Hz for a bubble of initial radius of 10um. Figure
Ja displays the status prior to applying the technique; while figure 3b exhibits
the same system when a secondary frequency of 500K Hz was applied with
the phase difference of pi/2 with the primer one. It is considerable in figure
