we perturb the bubble single frequency forcing by introducing a secondary
frequency drive to the system. In this respect firstly, through applying the
methods of chaos physics, nonlinear dynamics of a spherical cavitation bubble
driven by a single frequency source was studied in this paper. The consid-
ered control parameters were the applied pressure, frequency and the bubble
initial radius. An evaluation upon the stabilizing effect of a dual frequency
source on chaotic oscillations was carried out. For a fixed initial frequency,
different values of the secondary frequency along with its phase difference
with the fundamental were studied. These were done through plotting and
analyzing the bifurcation diagrams and the lyapunov exponent spectra. The
reason for using these analysis is that in the absence of any direct and reliable
mathematical methods, bifurcation diagrams and largest lyapunov exponent
spectra are very useful by providing a precise view on the dynamical behavior
of the system over a wide range of control parameters. They can be used as
powerful tools to determine suitable values for the secondary frequency and
the phase difference. For this reason we analyzed the consequences before
and after applying the introduced method through plotting the bifurcation
diagrams, lyapunov exponent spectra and time series of the bubble.
Results were promising as they indicated an accessible stabilizing role of a
dual frequency source on chaotic oscillations. The effective control param-
eters were found to be the value of the secondary frequency and the phase
difference.
2 The Bubble model
The bubble model used for the numerical simulation is derived in |4| and
is a modification of the bubble model formulated by Prosperetti|33| from
Keller-Miksis bubble equation|34|. The reason for using this model is that
it generated results in good agreement with those obtained by solving the
full partial differential equations of fluid dynamics and is suitable for a wide
range of amplitudes of oscillations [35]. It is is given by (1):
