of about 1 — 1.3M Pa to period four regular behavior. There are two small
other stable regions in about 1.6 — 1.7M Pa and 2.5 — 2.6 M Pa. As seen in
figure 96, a small domain of regular behavior around 1.2M Pa is created when
applying the value of 800K H z tor the secondary frequency. Also there is an-
other stable region in the range of about 1.9 —2M Pa. Both of these domains
were chaotic before applying the 800K H z of secondary frequency. Figure 9c
shows the bifurcation diagram when the secondary frequency is 2M Hz. A
vast region of stable oscillations is generated about 1.9 —2.9M Pa of pressure.
The oscillations are of different periods and some bubbling bifurcations and
period doublings are seen. There are other stable domains created in the
range of about 1.1 — 1.3M Pa and between 1.3 — 1.4M Pa of pressure. Em-
ploying the secondary frequency of 3M Hz (figure 9d), extremely stabilizes
the chaotic oscillations in the range of approximately 1.8 —2.3M Pa to period
one oscillations. Also another stable region is generated about 2.6 M Pa of
pressure.

In summary we see that like the influence of phase difference, the value of
the secondary frequency has a strong impact on the dynamics of a dual fre-
quency driven bubbles. Results show that by applying certain values for the
secondary frequency we may be capable of controlling the chaotic oscilla-
tions in different regions of interest. Combining the suitable choice for the
secondary frequency and the phase difference can help us greatly for this
purpose.

3.5 Effects of the secondary frequency and phase dif-

ference on the oscillation amplitudes
As it was seen the maximum oscillation amplitudes may change when apply-
ing the dual frequency technique. In order to study the effects of variations
in frequency and phase difference on the oscillations amplitude, firstly in fig-
ure 10a we have plotted time series of the normalized chaotic oscillations of
a bubble with initial radius of 50um driven by 300K Hz of frequency and
1M Pa of pressure. Then the proposed method is applied and the obtained
results are presented in figure 100 — ¢. In the lett column the phase differ-
ence 1s varied for a fixed secondary frequency and in the right column the
frequency is varied for a constant value of phase difference. Results demon-
strate that certain values of phase difference and secondary frequency may
stabilize the behavior whereas it can renovate chaos as observed in figures
