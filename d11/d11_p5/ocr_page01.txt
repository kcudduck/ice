— Abstract

i Acoustic cavitation bubbles are known to exhibit highly nonlinear

<3 and unpredictable chaotic dynamics. Their inevitable role in appli-

o) cations like sonoluminescence, sonochemistry and medical procedures

— suggests that their dynamics be controlled. Reducing chaotic oscilla-

= tions could be the first step in controlling the bubble dynamics by in-

oO creasing the predictability of the bubble response to an applied acous-

- tic field. One way to achieve this concept is to perturb the acoustic

> forcing. Recently, due to the improvements associated with using dual

Ne frequency sources, this method has been the subject of many studies

- which have proved its applicability and advantages. Due to this rea-

S son, in this paper, the oscillations of a spherical bubble driven by a
dual frequency source, were studied and compared to the ones driven
by a single source. Results indicated that using dual frequency had
a strong impact on reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular ones.
The governing parameters influencing its dynamics are the secondary
frequency and its phase difference with the fundamental frequency.
Also using dual frequency forcing may arm us by the possibility of
generating oscillations of desired amplitudes. To our knowledge the
investigation of the ability of using a dual frequency forcing to control
chaotic oscillations are presented for the first time in this paper.
