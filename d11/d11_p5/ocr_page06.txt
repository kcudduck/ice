3b that after applying the secondary frequency, no chaotic behavior occurred
within 1.55 — 2M Pa, which used to appear in the system driven by a single
frequency. The according lyapunov spectra have been outlined in figure 4.
The dashed line corresponds to the situation in the absence of the secondary
frequency. The solid line corresponds to the secondary frequency employed
situation. This figure indicates a significant abatement of the lyapunov expo-
nent from positive values to negative ones after the proposed technique was
engaged. The controlling phenomenon has also been granted by plotting the
normalized bubble oscillations versus time in a certain value of the pressure
before and after control in figure 5.
In order to show the capability of the proposed method to control the chaotic
oscillation versus other parameters, we have plotted the bifurcation diagram
of the bubble versus its initial radius, before and after control, in figures
6a — b. The frequency and the amplitude of the driving force are 300K H z
and 1M Pa, respectively. A secondary frequency of 1M Hz is introduced
while the phase difference is pi/4. Results indicate its controlling effect by
reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular behaviors of period 4 — period
3 — period 8 through bubbling bifurcation and again, period 4 in the ini-
tial radius of the range 37.3um-39um. Also the normalized oscillations of a,
bubble with 37.6m, before and after applying the secondary frequency, are
shown in figures 7a — 0.
3.3 Effects of the phase difference on the dynamics of

a dual frequency driven bubble
In bubble cavitation applications, the optimization of the control parameters
like viscosity and surface tension is mainly imposed by the media. Other
control parameters like pressure, initial frequency and initial radius are de-
termined by the sort of application. In dual frequency method the secondary
frequency and the phase difference can be conveniently dealt with to reach a
proper choice.
Two different circumstances were considered to understand their role:
1. Under a constant secondary frequency, its phase difference with the pri-
mary frequency is varied.
2. The amplitude of the secondary frequency is varied while the phase dif-
ference is held constant.
