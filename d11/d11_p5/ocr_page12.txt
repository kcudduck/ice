Figurel. Bifurcation diagram and the corresponding Lyapuonov spectrum of
a bubble with 10pm initial radius driven with 500K Hz of frequency versus
pressure , la- normalized bubble radius versus pressure, 1b6- Corresponding
Lypunov spectrum.
Figure2. Bifurcation diagram and the corresponding Lyapuonov spectrum
of a bubble with 10um initial radius driven with 500K Pa of pressure versus
frequency, 2a- normalized bubble radius versus frequency 2b- corresponding
Lyapunov spectrum.
Figured. Bifurcation diagrams of the normalized bubble radius driven by
200K Hz of frequency with the initial radius of 10um versus pressure: 3a-
Chaotic behavior before applying the proposed technique, 3b- after technique
engagement with 1,=500K Hz and a=pi/2.
Figured. Lyapunov spectra before and after applying the proposed method.
The dashed line represents the case before applying the method while the
solid line represents the system after control.
Figured. Time series of normalized bubble radius driven by 200K Hz of
frequency and 1.7M Pa of pressure: 5a- Chaotic oscillations, 5b- Regular
oscillations after introducing the dual frequency method (v,=500K Hz and
a=pi/2).
Figure6. Bifurcation diagrams of the bubble normalized radius versus initial
radius driven by 300K Hz of frequency and 1M Pa of pressure: 6a- chaotic
behavior before control, 6b6- Periodic behavior after the technique engage-
ment (o=1MHz and a=pi/4).
Figure7. Time series of the normalized oscillations of the bubble with initial
radius of 37.6um driven by 300K H z of frequency and 1M P of applied pres-
sure: 7a- without applying the proposed technique, 7b- After applying the
proposed technique (r,=1M Hz and a=pi/4).
