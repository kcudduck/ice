3 Results and discussion
3.1 Bubble dynamics driven by a single frequency
The dynamics of the bubble driven by a single frequency source were stud-
ied numerically by solving equation (1). The bifurcation diagram and the
lyapunov exponent spectrum of a bubble with initial radius of 10pm were
sketched versus pressure and frequency in a wide range. Figures la — b
show the bifurcation diagram and lyapunov spectrum of a bubble driven by
S00K Hz of frequency versus pressure within 10K Pa — 2M Pa. Figure la
demonstrates the highly nonlinear complex dynamics of the bubble through-
out the pressure increase, which includes stable period one, period two, four,
eight, chaos and then period three, period six and once more chaos. Also
there are two windows of complex periodic behavior inside the second chaotic
domain. Figure 1b shows its corresponding lyapunov exponent which con-
firms figure la substantiating chaotic behavior by positive values and stable
periodic oscillations by negative ones.
