1 Introduction

Cavitation bubbles, driven in motion by an acoustic field, are the example
of highly nonlinear forced oscillators. The study of their behavior, recently,
has attracted lots of attention and it is shown that this phenomenon exhibit
highly nonlinear and complex dynamics both experimentally |1, 2, 3| and
numerically |4, 5, 6, 7|. Besides their complex behavior, acoustically driven
bubbles have lots of advantageous applications in material science, sonolu-
minescence and sonochemistry |8, 9, 10, 11, 12|, sonofusion |13| and medical
procedures such as: lithotripsy, diagnostic imaging, drug and gene delivery,
increasing membrane permeability, opening blood brain barrier and high in-
tensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) surgery |14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In all of these
applications a conventional single frequency acoustic source has been used
to provide the bubble oscillations. As an alternative to this conventional
approach recently using dual frequency sources has lured a great amount of
attention in order to improve the outcome of the applications involving acous-
tic cavitation. Dual frequency has been used to enhance sonoluminescence
phenomenon |19, 20, 21, 22, 23] resulting in an increase in the light emis-
sion up to 300 percent. In ultrasound imaging, it introduces a robust back
scatter of ultrasound agents even at low intensity frequencies, which can be
optimized up to 200 percent brighter as compared to single frequency employ-
ment [24]. In sonochemistry, using two harmonics has shown to increase the
energy efficacy and enhance sonochemical reactors function |25, 26, 27, 28].
In therapeutic applications such as sonodynamic therapy and HIFU, using
a dual frequency source is shown to greatly increase the treatment efficacy
29, 30, 31, 32|. In the above mentioned applications, an optimum employ-
ment of bubbles suggests that chaotic oscillations be reduced, because when
the bubble motion gets chaotic, its behavior becomes unpredictable and very
hard to control. Therefor, reducing chaotic oscillations can be the first step
in precisely controlling the bubble dynamics and can provide more beneficial
outcomes.

In applications involving cavitation, the parameters like the viscosity, surface
tension or the diameter of the bubble are determined by the media and type
of the application. Therefore, in order to carry out control strategies in the
system, the only remaining parameter that can be dealt with, is the per-
turbation of the forcing term. As mentioned using dual frequency sources is
practical and has been proved to have many advantages in an increasing num-
ber of applications. For this reason, in order to stabilize the bubble motion,
