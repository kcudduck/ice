maximum at 9.2 ms. This laser beam passes through a quarter wave plate and polariser for
modulating the energy and then focused using a planoconvex lens of focal length 250mm
that creates a focal spot of 4mm in diameter on the aluminium plate. For bubbles shown with
a > m/2 the laser is focused on the water droplet attached to bottom of an aluminium plate
(1 mm thick) kept at bottom of a water tank and for the bubbles with a < 7/2 the laser if
focused on the top of this aluminium plate kept at the bottom of same tank (see figure 11).
The laser energy is set to 50% of maximum in case where @ < m/2 and we observe the
cavitation phenomenon in the water tank using high speed camera.
