case, an unconventional jetting mechanism 1s observed and shown to be responsible for the
appearance of a vortex dipole travelling in the direction opposite to the wall. The nature of
interaction between the bubble and the surrounding medium is then strongly influenced by
the bubble shape at the instant before collapse, appearing as a critical parameter if one wants
to control or model the physical phenomena triggered by the collapse of bubbles attached to
a wall.

The findings of this work could be used to explain and control various processes triggered
by the collapse of bubbles. Some examples include mixing and transport processes, the
development of treatment technologies based on the bubble—tissue interactions including
drug delivery and high intensity ultrasound techniques (Prentice ef al. 2005; Ohl et al.
20060; Maxwell ef al. 2011) and the interactions between a collapsing bubble and the free
surface (Kedrinskil 1978). Another exciting phenomenon 1s generation of surface waves from
the bubble collapse in deep water. The phenomenon described in this manuscript may be
eventually related to the appearance of Tsunamis from underwater volcanic eruptions where
the mechanisms linking both processes are not fully understood yet Paris (2015). Finally the
fundamental understanding of interaction of collapsing bubble with the surrounding media
should improve the design and development of various technologies based on the physical,
mechanical and chemical effects induced by the collapse of bubbles. The relation of the
singularity of potential flow to the well known force singularity during the motion of contact
line described by Huh & Scriven (1971) remains another open research problem where the
solutions reported 1n this work may inspire new ideas.

Appendix A. Convergence study

The convergence properties of the contact line velocity and jet velocity are discussed in this
section. The velocity of the contact line (figure 10a where |urp| is contact line velocity)
changes as the mesh is refined since slip length changes implicitly (1 = Axi, /2). It is also
evident from the same plot that in very short times the well known scaling for the thickness
of the boundary layer (¢!/?) is not recovered as the boundary layer is not well resolved. At
slightly longer times the boundary layer growth recovers the expected scaling law. Despite of
the sensitivity of the contact line motion to the slip length imposed, the peak interface velocity
(Jet velocity uj.) plotted in Figure 10b reveal that the numerical results are converged and
therefore independent of the slip length.
