FTE Vp. (3.2)
The magnitude of pressure gradient field (or acceleration field) at short infinitesimal times
govern the dynamics of bubble collapse at a finite time. To obtain the acceleration we
introduce the dimensionless pressure p = Pr Note that in the linear problem the
interface does not move, therefore surface tension effects at short times only introduce
a correction on the scaling prefactor (po — po.) upon which the solution depends. The
divergence of equation 3.2 leads to a Laplace equation (V?5 = 0) which can be solved with
appropriate boundary conditions for p. In particular we impose p = 1 far away from the
bubble, p = 0 at the bubble interface and 2p = (0 at the solid boundary. The solution of this
equation depends only on the geometry of the bubble which 1s fully described as a function
of the contact angle (a). This simplified representation of the fluid fields at short times 1s
referred as ‘free surface model’ 1n this article.

In figure 2a we start presenting the 1socontours of the magnitude of the non-dimensional
acceleration (|Vp|) field obtained for a spherical cap bubble with contact angle a = on
while figure 2b shows the variation of same along the wall in the liquid phase with respect
to the distance from the contact line obtained from free surface model. The 1socontours in
the left half are obtained numerically from the free surface model, while on the right half
are obtained from the DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations (using setup shown in figure 4a)
accounting for the presence of a gas with non-zero density (p;/ ps = 1073) and a finite value
of viscosity (u;/pug = 1072) at = = 2.07 - 107°. Good agreement between the two models
supports the argument that equation 2.2 1s a good representation of the fluid dynamics at
very short times. We clearly distinguish two separate regions: the far-field where the pressure
gradient contours are hemispherical caps centred at the axis of symmetry, and the near field
where the contours for pressure gradient are intricate and diverge on approaching the triple
contact point. Next, we characterise each of these regions:

3.1.1. Near field

The numerical solution of the interface acceleration at the initial time 1s shown 1n figure 3a,
where we use the angle with respect to the solid wall 6,,, to parametrise the interface position.
The origin, 6,, = 0, corresponds to the point of contact between the interface and the solid
wall and 6,, = 7/2 is the intersection of the interface with the axis of symmetry. Figure 3a
depicts the local non-dimensional acceleration magnitude at bubble interface |a|/a( for four
representative cases with a = 7/3, n/2,2n/3,3n/4. The value of the reference acceleration
1s chosen as ag = oR which 1s the acceleration magnitude for a spherical bubble with
radius R. and a known pressure difference. As expected, in the case of @ = 7/2, the numerical
solution recovers the Rayleigh-Plesset solution and the non-dimensional acceleration 1s
uniform and equal to one all over the interface. When a < m/2 the interface acceleration
(thus velocity) tends to zero at the contact point, and therefore it seizes to move even In
the potential flow problem with a slip wall. For a > n/2, the appearance of the singularity
1s evident as the acceleration diverges as we approach the 6,, — 0 limit. To interpret this
result one must keep in mind that the general solution of the Laplace equation in spherical
coordinates can be obtained by separation of variables that leads to an infinite series. This
series sometimes diverges at the edge where Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
