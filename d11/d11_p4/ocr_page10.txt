This expression exhibits a singularity at the contact point (ry — 0) when by = 5 < 1
(or @ > m/2) implying that the acceleration at the triple contact point is infinite. In these
conditions the first term in the expansion 1s the leading order term that eventually dominates
the solution 1n the region ry < R.. This can also be clearly seen in figure 2b where the
fitting curve shown with solid line 1s obtained using the first term of the series solution (i.e.
parameters Cy and bg 1n equation 3.4). We repeat the fitting procedure for various a to verify
that the numerical values of by match well with theoretical predictions and find Cy which 1s
a constant of order one that slightly increases with a (figure 3b).

Focusing on the characterisation of the regimes where the singularity appears, figure 3a
clearly shows that the numerical solution (dots) 1s well described by equation 3.4 evaluated at
the interface (solid lines), showing excellent agreement close to the contact point, 1.e. small
values of 6,,. Near the axis of symmetry (e.g. 8,, — n/2 and 7; = 1), the errors are visible
and the first term 1n the series does not suffice to describe accurately the acceleration field.
3.1.2. Far field solution
The far field flow created by the bubble corresponds to a punctual sink sitting at the
intersection between the wall and the axis of symmetry. The integration of the momentum
equation in the radial coordinate provides the magnitude of pressure gradient generated by a
punctual sink at an arbitrary distance from the sink as

where |a;| is the magnitude of averaged acceleration along the interface, which determines
the strength of the punctual sink. Figures 2b clearly shows that this equation captures well
the decay of the pressure gradient with the distance 7,, far from the interface. Because the
first term of the series 1.e. equation 3.4 predicts the interface acceleration reasonably well,
we obtain an estimation of the averaged acceleration magnitude for bubbles with a > 7/2 as

where §;, stands for the bubble interface surface and G («) is a geometrical factor that can be
numerically computed assuming that the first term in the series 1s indeed the leading order
term along the entire bubble interface. Figure 3c shows that the averaged nondimensional
interface acceleration magnitude obtained using this model, which compares well with the
numerical results of the free surface model and the solution of the both viscous and inviscid
Navier-Stokes equations. The results of the simplified model are obtained using the value of
Co numerically computed and reported in figure 3b. For a > 7/2, |a| increases with a. The
three proposed models agree well for the angles tested implying that the free surface model
as well as the simplified expression given in equation 3.6 capture well the averaged bubble
response at short times for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers.
