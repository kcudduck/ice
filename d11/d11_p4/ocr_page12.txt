the wall, the thickness of this layer defined by the height for which the velocity 1s maximum.
Outside this region the free surface potential flow solution (equation 3.4), shown with a solid
black line, predicts the interface velocity obtained from DNS relatively well, therefore the
potential flow solution 1s a good approximation of the collapse process outside the viscous
boundary layer. Inside the viscous boundary layer, the interface acceleration 1s sensitive to
the slip length imposed (see Appendix A) and also to the movement of the contact line. In
this region, the solution of free surface model at # = O cannot be extrapolated to predict the
flow field near the contact line at short times. Remarkably, although the contact line motion
1s grid dependent, the average acceleration and the maximum jet velocity 1s shown to be
independent of the slip length imposed (see Appendix A). This fact together with slight
dependence of the average acceleration with Re (figure 3c) confirms that for large enough
Reynolds numbers, the bubble dynamic response 1s mainly governed by the potential flow
solution and not by the particular contact line motion model used. In these conditions, the
free surface potential flow model at r = O 1s a useful tool to predict the average dynamics of
the interface at short times.

In order to characterise the jet formation process we extract the maximum interface velocity
magnitude from DNS data, which we name as jet velocity uj... This velocity 1s fitted using
a power law function of the form (figure 5a)

where ¢ 1s a coeflicient that becomes smaller than one when the acceleration 1s singular at
t = 0. A theoretical estimation of coeflicient g accounting for viscous effects can be obtained
from the singular solution described in the previous section as following: The jet velocity after
short time (#5) can be approximated from the initial acceleration evaluated at the interface at
height equal to thickness of boundary layer z = d(¢y). The d is given approximately by the
solution of the Stokes problem for the flow near the flat plate that 1s impulsively started from

this case the jet velocity velocity 1s estimated as
