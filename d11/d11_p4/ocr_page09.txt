Figure 3: (a) Non-dimensional acceleration magnitude, |aj|/ag along the interface
parametrised using the angle 6,, (measured in the counter-clockwise direction from the
point of contact of wall and the axis of symmetry) for a = 3 z, 2, 27. Dots represent
the numerical solution from free surface model and the thick lines are predictions using
equation 3.4 evaluated at the interface. (b) Exponent by and coefficient Cy obtained from
fitting the pressure gradient obtained from the free surface model along the wall for
different a. (c¢) Non-dimensional averaged interface acceleration magnitude as a function
of the contact angle using different methods: analytical expression given by equation 3.6

Euler equations (black crosses), and the DNS solution of the Navier—Stokes solver for
Re = 100 (red crosses).
meet due to the appearance of a singularity (Dauge 2006). This singularity was reviewed
extensively in the past (Landau & Lifshitz 1959; Blum & Dobrowolski 1982; Steger 1990;
Deegan et al. 1997; Li & Lu 2000) but the studies where this singularity appears in the bubble
dynamics problems are rare. The asymptotic solutions close to the point where homogeneous
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions meet can be alternatively expressed by using
the general solution of the Laplace equation (Li & Lu 2000; Dauge 2006; Yosibash et al.
2011) and takes the form of

Taking the derivative with respect to the normal of the interface we readily find the interface
