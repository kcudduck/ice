Figure 2: (a) Isocontours of the magnitude of acceleration for bubble with a = a = 37/4:
The 1socontours 1n the left half are obtained from free surface model and those 1n the right
half are obtained from DNS. (») Non-dimensional acceleration magnitude along the wall

Weber number, are determined only by the radius of curvature of the bubble. In the particular
experiments considered in this study the radius of curvature remains to be of the order
1 cm obtaining characteristic values of the Weber and Reynolds number of the order of
We ~ O(10%) and Re ~ O(10°). The influence of finite values of Reynolds is briefly
discussed using Direct Numerical Simulations.
3. Short time dynamics
At short times, we can simplify the system of equations if we consider the liquid as an
incompressible substance and the interface as a free surface, 1.e. we neglect inertial and
viscous effects inside the bubble. This assumption is reasonable given that u,/u; <1
and p,/p; < 1 (in experiments the density ratio is of the order of 10~> when the bubble
pressure equals the vapour pressure). The velocity at short times remains a small quantity,
thus we can neglect the convective terms as compared to temporal derivatives of velocity and
spatial pressure gradients (Batchelor 2000). This hypothesis remains true when time scales
under consideration are smaller than the advection time scales 1.e. he < 1. Under these
assumptions the solution of the velocity is obtained from the integration of the linearised
momentum equation as

It 1s classical for this linear system to decompose the velocity field in to a potential part (ug)
and a viscous correction (u,) i.e. u = uy +u,,. The potential flow theory gives u, whereas the
viscous correction requires complex analysis (Saffman 1995; Batchelor 2000; Pope 2001).
For the short times and large enough Reynolds numbers, the viscous contributions to velocity
are relevant only in the small region of thickness § ~ O(\/vt) near the solid boundary. Thus
in such a situation, we expect the solution to be governed by the potential part and the viscous
part 1s only a correction in a thin region close to the wall. We discuss these aspects next.
