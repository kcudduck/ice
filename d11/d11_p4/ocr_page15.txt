similar to those observed by Reuter ef al. (2017) which are persistent in nature and can travel
large distances in comparison to bubble size. The generation of this vortex ring 1s illustrated
numerically in figure 8a where the colour maps show the vorticity field. A clear re-entrant
annular jet is observed, followed by a mushroom like structure and the bubble detaches from
the wall consequently a jet in the upwards direction which eventually leads to formation of
vortex ring. In the experiments we visualise this by adding the dye in the bottom of the tank
(figure 8b) during the collapse of a flat bubble. This vortex ring can travel to long distance
and induce unusual long range effects like free surface waves and jetting (see supplementary
movie 3).
4.1.2. Dynamics of bubbles with an effective contact angle smaller than nt [2
The dynamics of bubbles with contact angles smaller than 90 degrees (figure 7 b) can be
obtained using a classical experiment where a laser is focused directly in to the liquid very
close to the wall. The bubble shape from snapshot 2 in figure 7b 1s approximated with a
spherical cap that gives R. = 7.63 x 102m and & = 0.389x. The interface contours obtained
numerically are shown with the red curves scaled to size of the bubble size in first snapshot.
In this case, the interface acceleration 1s minimum at the contact line and maximum at the tip
of the spherical cap leading to a conventional high—speed liquid jet directed towards the wall
(see figure 7b and supplementary movie 2). This jet developed towards the wall impinges
in to the solid surface causes cavitation damage. Similar dynamics have been described in
several of previous studies (Naudé & Ellis 1961; Gonzalez-Avila et al. 2021).
4.2. Finite Reynolds number effects
Popinet & Zaleski (2002) showed that for the small bubbles collapsing in the vicinity of a
rigid wall, the jets can be suppressed due to the viscous effects. In this section, we use the
DNS to quantitatively predict the range of size for which the observations reported in this
