solution accurately represents the results of DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation). Despite the
fact that viscosity instantaneously regularise the solution near the singularity and predicts
finite velocities, the effect of singularity 1s still present outside the boundary layer and it
explains the changes in the nature of the jet generated. In addition, we show that there 1s a
direct link between the bubble response at short times and the formation of vortex ring that
eventually leads to surprising long range interaction effects between the bubble and a free
surface (see supplementary video) that have not been reported before. These results provide
a significant advance in the characterisation of the interaction mechanisms between a bubble
and 1ts surrounding medium and may be a reasoning behind unexplained delayed effects in
underwater explosions observed by Kedrinskii (1978) and tsunami generation by underwater
volcano eruptions (Paris 2015).
2. Problem setup
We focus on the classical three-dimensional Rayleigh collapse problem for a bubble that
has a spherical cap shape (figure 1). This choice 1s motivated by the fact that for a spherical
cap the bubble geometry 1s defined by only two parameters, the bubble radius and the
contact angle, which simplifies the discussion of the results compared to more complex
shapes (e.g. ellipsoids) that could be focus of future investigations. We restrict ourselves to
an axisymmetric configuration where the initial bubble pressure p, o 1s uniform inside the
bubble and the liquid, 1nitially at rest, 1s at a higher pressure far from the bubble po, > peo.
This problem represents the solution of a bubble in equilibrium state subjected to impulsive
action caused by a sudden increase 1n far-field pressure, and 1s also a good approximation
for the dynamic response of a low pressure bubble after the expansion stage when it reaches
its maximum radius and the liquid velocity approaches to zero.
The dynamics of this system is governed by the mass, momentum and energy conservation
laws, which for the ith component in a multi-component setup 1s given as
