develops regularising the flow close to the contact point. We use the results from the DNS
of the Navier-Stokes equations at short times to investigate the influence of viscosity on the
dynamic response of the bubbles.

We solve for the full set of equations 2.1 where, for the sake of simplicity, we neglect
surface tension effects. The equations are solved using the All-Mach implementation
(Popinet 2015; Fuster & Popinet 2018), where the one fluid approach is used to solve the
modelling equations. This solver has been already used successfully to investigate some
aspects on the interaction of an oscillating bubble and a rigid tube by Fan er al. (2020)
and interactions of collapsing bubbles with free surface by Saade er al. (2021). The setup
for numerical simulations 1s shown 1n figure 4a, where a spherical cap-shaped bubble 1s
initialised in a square domain of size 100 times the initial radius of curvature of this bubble.
We use such large domains so that the pressure waves reflected from the boundaries do not
affect the solution, moreover grid 1s coarsened away from the bubble to diffuse these waves.
The simulations are axisymmetric about left boundary and the bubble 1s initially in contact
with the bottom boundary where a non-slip boundary conditions 1s applied. The faraway
boundaries are given constant far-field pressure conditions and homogeneous Neumann
condition for velocity. The grid 1s refined progressively near the interface to a minimum
orid size of Axi, /R. = 0.00038. The maximum time step in the simulation is governed
by acoustic CFL restriction, which in our case 1s 0.4. The initial pressure field inside the
domain 1s given from Equation 2.2, velocity field 1s given as zero and total energy 1s given
from EOS.

In figure 4b we characterise the bubble motion at short non-dimensional time tU./R,
by showing the evolution of the time averaged interface acceleration magnitude parallel to
the wall, defined as a, (¢#) = u,(¢)/t, as a function of the normal distance from the wall.
The results shown with coloured dots are obtained from DNS for @ = 27/3 and Re = 100
where colour scale represents the non-dimensional time varying between 7.27 - 10™ and
3.6 - 107%. The inset figure shows the clear development of a boundary layer very close to
