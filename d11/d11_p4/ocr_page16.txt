manuscript apply. We take an ideal case of an air bubble with p;, o = 0.1 atm and constant
contact angle equal to 120 degrees collapsing in water at an ambient far field pressure. In
this situation, the characteristic velocity of the process stays constant and equal to 10 m/s
and the initial radius of curvature 1s then left as the unique parameter controlling the values
of the Reynolds and Weber number.

In figure 9a we show the maximum non-dimensional velocity reached during the collapse
as a function of the Reynolds number. For Reynolds numbers above a given critical value
Re > Re. = 100 the influence of Reynolds on the peak velocities 1s only marginal. However,
when the Reynolds 1s below this critical value, the jet velocity drops dramatically further
decaying with decreasing Re . This sudden change on the peak velocities 1s controlled by the
appearance of jetting, which 1s not visible for Re < 100 (see figure 9b). For a low pressure air
bubble collapsing in water at atmospheric pressure these results reveal that the observations
reported (reversed re-entrant jet) are applicable for bubbles larger than R. > 10um. We
must still emphasise that the results reported here are limited to spherical cap bubbles. In
reality other kind of behaviour can be observed depending upon the mechanism by which the
bubbles are generated and the bubble shape reached at the instant of maximum expansion.
If the bubble shape 1s not a spherical cap or the microlayer 1s not able to drain during the
bubble collapse or the bubble size 1s comparable to pits, it can lead to a variety of other
collapse and jetting dynamics discussed by Lechner ef al. (2020), Reuter & Ohl (2021) and
Trummler ef al. (2020) respectively.

5. Conclusions

In this work, we show that the impulsive potential flow theory can be used to discuss the
influence of the bubble shape on the dynamic response of collapsing bubbles for sufficiently
large Reynolds and Weber numbers. As an example, we present the results obtained for the
collapse of the spherical cap bubbles showing that the effective contact angle at the instant
of maximum expansion controls the interface acceleration at the beginning of the collapse
phase and the jetting direction observed in Direct Numerical Simulations and experiments.
When a > 90 degrees the potential flow solution at small times shows the appearance
of a singularity which causes extremely high accelerations close to the contact point and
a change in vorticity direction with respect to the a < 90 degrees case. In the former
