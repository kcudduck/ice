As shown in Figures 5b this model 1s capable of capturing the evolution of the jet velocity
at short times found from DNS simulations accounting for viscous effects when a > n/2.
The exponent g (figure 5b) decreases as a increases because the acceleration gradient in the
normal direction increases with a as seen in figure 3a. Note that the DNS results confirm
that g < 1 for @ > m/2 and therefore the jet acceleration is singular at 1 = 0 even in the
presence of viscous effects.

Another interesting quantity to describe the overall interface dynamics 1s the vorticity
generated during the collapse. At short times, vorticity 1s concentrated in a sheet vortex at
the wall and at the interface. By assuming zero stress condition at the interface for ¢ = 0, the
only non-zero component of the vorticity can be written as

It follows from the potential flow solution (figure 3a) that the sign of the acceleration gradient
changes depending upon initial contact angle i.e. if it is greater or less than 71/2, reverting the
sign of the vortex sheet generated at the interface. This behaviour is indeed observed from
the numerical simulations as shown in figure 6 (a and b), where the strength of the vortex
sheet 1s plotted with saturated colour maps. The change in dominant colour represents the
opposite sign of vorticity at interface between the two cases.
4. Long time dynamics
4.1. High Reynolds regime
After describing the short time dynamics, in this section we investigate the long time
consequences of this singular response using the experiments and DNS. The results for two
representative cases a > m/2 and a < 1/2 shown in figure 7 (a) and (b) are discussed now.
4.1.1. Dynamics of bubbles with an effective contact angle larger than mw /2
First we discuss the case where the singularity is present (e.g. « > m/2). The generation of
bubbles with @ > 7/2 can be investigated using the setup described briefly in appendix B
and references (Bourguille ef al. 2017; Tahan ef al. 2020). The laser 1s focused at the bottom
of liquid tank where a water drop 1s attached. The cavitation in the water drop induces shock

interact to form a flat bubble with shape similar to spherical cap at maximum volume (figure /
