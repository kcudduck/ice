1 o;u - u per unit volume. Finally the equation of state (EOS) 1s written as p;e; = poi
where I" and II are adopted from Johnsen & Colonius (2006) in such a way that liquid 1s
a slightly compressible and the bubble contents obeys an ideal gas EOS. The system of
equations 1s closed by adding an advection equation for the interface position which 1s
represented by the volume of fluid method (Tryggvason ef al. 2011). After the advection, the
interface 1s reconstructed using a piecewise linear interface construction. The surface-tension
appears implicitly while averaging the equation 2.1 in the mixed cells and 1t 1s added as the
continum surface force using the method of Brackbill er al. (1992) also reviewed recently
by Popinet (2018). All the intricate details of the method are given in Fuster & Popinet (2018)

In the DNS, a non-slip boundary condition is imposed on the velocity field at the wall,
while a standard free flow condition 1s applied in all the other boundaries. Note that
although a non-slip boundary condition imposes zero velocity at the boundary, the velocity
at which the interface 1s advected in the cell adjacent to the wall 1s different from zero. This
effectively acts as an implicit slip length for the contact line motion given as A = Axi, /2,
where Ax,,;, 1s the smallest grid size. This influence of this parameter will be discussed 1n
appendix A. The static contact angle model proposed by Afkhami & Bussmann (2008) is
used to implement contact angle boundary condition which although 1s not very accurate
for prediction the contact line motion but is a convenient tool that gives fair insight of the
growth of boundary layer and range of influence of viscosity. More sophisticated models for
contact line motion could be used but a significant change in the conclusions of this work 1s
not expected.

The initial conditions are defined by imposing the fluid to be initially at rest (uz = 0). In
this case the divergence of the momentum equation gives a Laplace equation for the initial
liquid pressure while assuming the liquid as an incompressible substance,

Ap; = 0. (2.2)
This equation 1s readily solved if we assume that the gas pressure 1s initially uniform such
that the boundary conditions for pressure (as shown in figure 1) are the following: at the
interface the liquid pressure 1s

where o 1s the surface tension coefficient and R, 1s the radius of curvature; at the far—away
boundaries the pressure 1s po, and at the wall the normal pressure gradient is null due to
impermeability condition. The initial condition for total energy 1s then calculated from the
EOS using the initial pressure field.

We finally introduce relevant dimensionless quantities using the radius of curvature as
characteristic length, the liquid density and the characteristic velocity U., = (poo/ on 2
obtained by assuming that at the instant of maximum radius the liquid pressure along the
surface 1s negligible compared to the far-field pressure. A simple dimensional analysis shows
that the solution of the problem depends on the density and viscosity ratios, the Reynolds
number, Re = fre, the Weber number We = pUcRe and the contact angle (a). The
characteristic velocity 1s constant and equal to 10 m/s for the low pressure bubbles collapsing
in water under the action of the atmospheric pressure, therefore both, the Reynolds and
