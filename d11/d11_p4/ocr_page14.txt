Figure 7: The snapshots of bubble shape are shown for the two representative cases, the
numerical bubble shapes shown with red curves are overlaid at same times and scaled to
same length as in experiments. (a) Case where a > 7/2, each snapshots are taken every
0.1 ms (b) Case where a < 7/2, each snapshots are taken every 0.125 ms.
a). The snapshots are taken at every 0.1 ms, the interface from the second snapshotis extracted
and fitted with an approximate spherical cap which gives R. = 7.56x 10m and @ = 0.727.

We reproduce the experimental conditions numerically using the numerical setup
described in section 3.2. The minimum mesh size of Ax = 60um, the far field pressure po 1s
1 atm and the pressure inside bubble 1s set to a low value of 0.1 atm which 1s chosen by hit
and trial method to match the numerical collapse time with the collapse time 1n experiments.
We consider both surface tension and viscous effects in the numerical simulations with
Re =~ 75600 and We ~ 10500. The numerically obtained bubble shapes plotted with red
contours and scaled to bubble size in snapshot 2, these are subsequently overlaid on the
experimental snapshots after same times. A very good agreement 1s seen between the
numerical and the experimental bubble shapes, small differences subsist because of the
simplification of the bubble shape during the expansion, the influence of gravity, mass
transfer and other effects that are not considered in the numerical simulations.

At the beginning of collapse phase the highest interface velocity 1s developed at edge of
the viscous boundary layer (see figure 4b) that leads to the appearance of an annular jet
which 1s generated parallel to the wall and a mushroom-like shape of the interface contour
(see figure 7a and supplementary movie 1). These results are consistent with previous
numerical works of Lauer ef al. (2012) and Koukouvinis ef al. (2016). Remarkably, when
the collapse 1s strong enough and the jet reaches the axis of symmetry, a stagnation point
appears there and a secondary upward jet normal to the wall is generated. The re-entrant jet
observed for @ > m/2 is not conventional in cavitation and generates vortex ring structures
