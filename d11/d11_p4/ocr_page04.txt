effect of cavitation in wastewater and biomass treatment. Lyons ef al. (2019) compared the
low frequency sound signals from volcanic eruptions to that of bubble collapse and suspect
the bubbles of the order of 100 m are created by the interaction of magma with water. Bubbles
can generally appear from the nuclei sitting at walls (Crum 1979; Atchley & Prosperetti
1989; Borkent ef al. 2009), making the interaction with the wall an essential aspect of
bubble collapse dynamics. The wall modifies the symmetry of the pressure field near the
bubble that causes unequal interface acceleration and thus high-speed liquid jets leading to
a complex cavitation phenomena (Popinet & Zaleski 2002; Brenner ef al. 2002; Supponen
2017). These jets are important to understand the destructive potential of the cavitation
bubbles for several biomedical applications such as the disruption of biological membranes
in High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound (HIFU), lithotripsy, histotripsy and sonoporation
techniques (Prentice ef al. 2005; Ohl ef al. 20060; Maxwell ef al. 2011; Pishchalnikov ef al.
2019). Other applications concerning erosion, surface cleaning, noise emission and
manufacturing processes (e.g. shotpeening) are also closely linked to the phenomenon
of jetting (Krefting ef al. 2004; Blake et al. 2015). The bottleneck in development and
comprehension of these techniques as well as naturally occurring phenomenon remains
the limited understanding of the interaction amongst cavitation bubble and its surrounding
medium.

It 1s well known that the jets formed during the collapse of bubbles in the presence of
a nearby wall are directed towards the wall and that the characteristics of these jets can
be described well using the scaling laws given by Popinet & Zaleski (2002) and Supponen
(2017). However, the investigations on the collapse of a bubble initially attached to a wall are
reported less often. Naudé & Ellis (1961) discuss the collapse of bubble initially in contact
with wall by writing the higher order perturbation solutions to potential flow model. They
also show the collapse dynamics of such bubbles experimentally by producing bubbles with
electric spark in the liquid close to wall. Hupfeld ef al. (2020) present experimental results
for laser induced bubbles using ultra-high speed photography in the high capillary number
regimes. They study both expansion and collapse phase in several liquids to understand the
effect of viscosity on the growth, collapse and bubble shapes including liquid microlayer
and contact line evolution. Both Naudé & Ellis (1961) and Hupfeld ef al. (2020) show that
during the collapse the jet 1s directed towards the solid whereas Li ef al. (2018) show that
the jet can be directed in opposite direction when a collapsing bubble 1s 1n contact with a
spherical solid particle. Similar problem 1s studied numerically by Lechner et al. (2020),
who also include the effect of bubble expansion and the liquid microlayer that results in to
different nature of bubble collapse and jetting. This problem has also been briefly discussed
1n numerical studies of Lauer ef al. (2012) and Koukouvinis ef al. (2016) who observe the
change 1n jetting behaviour as a function of bubble shape but they do not show jets opposite
to the wall. Reuter ef al. (2017) speculate the appearance of a jet parallel to the wall during
the secondary collapse and consequently the generation of vortex ring, although no direct
experimental observation 1s reported.

The initiation and consequences of this change of behaviour has not be understood and
the hydrodynamic description of the same 1s not available. In this article we bridge this gap
and describe the factors controlling the jetting direction using comprehensive theoretical,
numerical and experimental evidences. We clarify that the change in the jetting direction 1s
an implication of the singularity in the pressure gradient obtained from the potential flow
model. This singularity only appears when the effective contact angle at the instant before
the collapse 1s larger than 90 degrees. We show that at short instants after beginning of
collapse phase and for sufliciently large Reynolds and Weber numbers, the potential flow
