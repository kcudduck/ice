> This work reveals that the dynamic response of a spherical cap bubble in contact with a rigid
r=) wall depends on the effective contact angle at the instant prior to collapse. This parameter
— allows us to discriminate between two regimes in which the mechanisms of interaction
between the collapsing bubble and its surrounding medium differ significantly: When the
IS contact angle 1s smaller than 90 degrees a classical jet directed towards the wall 1s observed
[~ whereas 1f the initial contact angle 1s larger than 90 degrees an annular re-entrant jet parallel
\O to the wall appears. We show that this change of the behaviour can be explained using the
Ww impulse potential flow theory for small times which shows the presence of a singularity on
VQ the initial acceleration of the contact line when the contact angle 1s larger then 90 degrees.
- Direct Numerical Simulations show that although viscosity regularises the solution at z > 0,
— the solution remains singular at + = 0. In these circumstances numerical and experimental
OO results show that the collapse of flat bubbles can eventually lead to the formation of a vortex
iN ring that unexpectedly induces long-range effects. The role of the bubble geometry at the
oo instant of maximum expansion on the overall collapse process 1s shown to be well captured
> by the impulse potential flow theory, which can be easily generalised to other bubble shapes.
7 These results may find direct application in the interpretation of geophysical flows as well as
the control and design of bio-medical, naval, manufacturing and sonochemistry applications.

1. Introduction
Cavitation, the process of bubble formation and collapse, 1s a key physics problem because
of its applications in nature, mechanics, biomedical, and many other fields (Cole & Weller
1948; Lohse et al. 2001; Ohl et al. 2006a,b; Maxwell et al. 2013; Fuster 2019). In recent
studies, Hou ef al. (2021) show that cavitation bubbles can enhance the efficiency of solar
absorption refrigeration systems, Bhat & Gogate (2021) and Prado ef al. (2022) reviewed the
