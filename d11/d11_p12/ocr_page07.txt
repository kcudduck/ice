sonocrystallization is ambient RT and mostly athermal shock wave-dominated
phenomena needs exploration. In fact demonstration of the sonocrystallization
phenomenon includes (1) aspirin as model for the molecular crystal [90], (2) organic
molecules [91], (3) alkali halides as the ionic crystals [92]. The outputs of such studies
suggest it is the direct particle and shock wave interaction is responsible for facilitating
such phenomena. Still, a general acceptance of sonocrystallization out of these few
individual case studies on crystallization and acoustic cavitation is not sufficient. This
has also been suggested in a recent detailed review of possible mechanisms of
sonocrystallization in solution [93], [94].

Sono-agglomeration as a result of a high-velocity inter-particle collision and
subsequent fusion by melting delivered grain growth is also another significant physio-
chemical attribute. Literature on some unusual sonochemical-assisted assemblies
developed are: (1) graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotube (CNT) [95], (2) 2D-
materials (graphene, MoS;, h-BN etc) on flexible polymer substrates [96], (3)
mesocrystals of TiO2 and BaTiOs [97]-[100], and (4) silica spheres [101] etc. The case of
metals sono-agglomeration during sonoprocess is extensively investigated by Suslick
and co-authors et al [102]-[104]. Two particular outcomes of the metal sono-
agglomeration studies are; if (1) particles collide head-on, it leads to agglomeration;
otherwise if (2) the collision is at glancing angle leads to the removal of the inbuilt
respective metals surface oxide layer by cracking and finally making the surface highly
reactive. Thus, sonocrystallization leads to the generation of the crystalline nuclei while
sono-agglomeration drives these generated nuclei to coalescence resulting in building
unit and crystal growth.

Given these promising physio-chemical viables of ultrasonic sonochemistry, this

chapter is an attempt to realize, demonstrate, and quantity the phenomenon like; (a)

process intensification of chemical reaction, (b) sonocrystallization, (c) sono-

aggregation. These phenomenon are investigated using precursors; (1) N-polyvinyl
