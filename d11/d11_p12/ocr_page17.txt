to 50 nm indicating flat 2D nanostructured layers. One such layer having nano-Al
embedded in it is shown in fig. 4 7 (e). Likewise, PVP sonicated for extended 4 hrs
becomes network like and is, hence, not appropriate for nano-Al surface stabilization.
This extracted product examined in TEM is observed to have around 80-90 nm Al
particles wrapped in GC network. Also, the development of the amorphous-Al:0Os layer
is seen to be developed after storing in laboratory environment for a week.

Fig.4 8 [Sono-crystallization]: (a) PVP surface initiation of onion like features,
(b) densely populated such features, (c)-(e) microstructural evaluation
respectively.
The use of ultrasound in delivering crystallization in pharmaceutical had widespread
demonstrations, but the physical mechanism underlying this process physical
happenings is still under exploration [333], [339], [349]. Sonocrystallization of poly-3-
hexylthiophene (P3HT) chains to nanofibers by the application of the ultrasonic field is
