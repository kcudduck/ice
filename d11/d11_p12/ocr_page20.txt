TEM-SAED pattern. Besides TEM-SAED, the investigation of Al particle surface (i.e.
HRTEM mode) for the presence of surface oxide is attempted. However, HRTEM
surface oxide isolation remained unsuccessful in isolating surface oxide validates the
outcome 2 presented. The Al mesocrystal has shown in fig. 4 9 (d) just exposed to
HRTEM mode e-beam exposure (E4I5M) initiates the disintegration of the
mesocrystalline formulation of cubical building unit (see drawn schematic in tig. 4 3 (f)).
The disintegrated Al mesocrystal after 5 minutes of step-4 HRTEM mode exposure is
shown in fig. 4 9 (f). This implies Al cubical building units are loosely agglomerated
(facile disintegration under TEM e-beam) but in a periodic coherent order to behave as a
whole single crystalline block. Similar to present observation of Al mesocrystal
formation under ultrasonic irradiation, case studies of materials orderly arrangement
achieved in materials during sonoprocessing are; (1) BaTiOs mesocrystals, (2) layered
arrangement of CaCQOs, and (3) TiO, etc [356]-[360].

Although the ultrasonic irradiation-induced inter-particle collision is the leading
attribute contributing to sono-agglomeration, another essential contributor that needs
mention linked to the solvent physical attribute (i.e., surface tension, viscosity, and
vapor pressure, etc) used in sonolysis process. In brief preferred solvents having low
viscosity, low surface tension, and less vapor pressure are the most preferred [361]. The
list of conventional solvents mostly employed for sonochemical processing is; hexane,
hexadecane, pentane, dichloromethane, etc [362], [363]. Also, in the case of polar
(methanol, ethyl alcohol) vs non-polar solvent (diethyl ether, hexadecane) solvent effect
during sonoprocessing for fabricating pu-CuO agglomerates; highlights non-polar
solvents acts effectively [364]. The current Al mesocrystals extraction is done out of the
hexadecane solvent fabricate Al-rich compositions with Al (M)/ PVP (P) ratio higher
than 1:1 ratio. This product develops surface oxide after storage for a week in laboratory
conditions, hence not useful for fuel applications.
