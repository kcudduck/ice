4.6 Conclusions
The specific conclusions drawn from this chapter in the process of synthesizing air-
stable metallic-Al particles embedded in the PVP matrix are listed below.
1) The sonocrystallization of PVP to graphitic carbon (GC) at RT indicates the process as
athermal, thereby favors the dominant role of ultrasonic shock waves in causing it.
2) Similarly, the RT processed composite (RTSC/PVP-Al) only has metallic Al in its
nucleating state, thereby also in agreement with cited literature that sonocrystallization
leads to generation of Al nuclei or a nucleating phase of any sonoprocessed mater.
3) The nano-Al crystal growth is only achieved when the solution is allowed to self-heat
during sonoprocessing. The bulk solution heating probably causes an increase in the
rate of the head-on collision of these RT generated Al nuclei to fuse. The nuclei fusion
