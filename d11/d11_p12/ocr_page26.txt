and crystallized PVP matrix component, respectively. Similarly, the Al reference ICDD
PDEF-2: 04-0787 CIF file generated XRD pattern plotted as Al_generated, matches well
with that of the RTSC/3PVP-2Al composite product Al phase completing
crystallographic phase identification step. No other impurity phase corresponding to
the initial untreated precursor and other reaction generated unwanted phases are
observed, even though the sonocrystallization process progress is achieved at RT. Ice
cooled chilled water maintained at 20 °C is circulated all around the sonochemical
reaction vessel to dissipate bulk solution heat accumulation during 2 h long continuous
mode sonochemical processing.

Among the allotropes of carbon, hexagonal GC crystal form in ABABAB...
carbon layers stacking sequence is a fascinating microstructural feature enriching
extensive research and development activities [390]-[396]. Significantly, this carbon
forms layers one above other in parallel stacking (see fig. 4 13 (a)) which makes GC soft
and slippery nature due to contributions of these carbon layers facile expansion along
the c-axis. These ¢/2 stacked carbon layers are the x-ray diffracting entities that produce
a pronounced (002) diffraction peak, representing layers spacing. Any changes to this
¢/2 spacing brought in can easily be tracked by XRD measurement. The inset shown in
fig. 4 13 (a) is the XRD patterns of graphite, and one of its c-axis expanded structures,
indicates this one to one correspondence of c-axis stretching leading to XRD peak shift
to lower angles. It is important to note here that for material under stress-strain
investigation, in the elastic region below, yield point stress is proportional to strain
[397]. A graphical schematic of the generic physical shape for materials stress-strain
curve in both the elastic and plastic regions is plotted in tig. 4 13 (¢).
