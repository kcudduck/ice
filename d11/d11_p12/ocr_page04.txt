Abstract
The viability of ultrasonic sonochemistry is investigated in the context of delivering air-
stable metallic Al rich-PVP composite. The parameters investigated are; sono-(1)
process intensification, (2) crystallization, (3) agglomeration, and (4) fragmentation,
respectively. The conventional solvent of n-hexadecane is employed as the sonotrode
generated pressure transmitting medium to carry out the above experiments. Two
precursors, (1) Poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and (2) Aluminum chloride (AICls) are
chosen to evaluate and demonstrate the viability of the ultrasonic induced processing.
Temperature controlled investigations at RT and higher temperature help in achieving;
(a) PVP-graphitization, and (b) Al-crystal growth phenomenon, respectively. The
current experiments aid in helping to isolate and identify actual mechanistic
happenings. The investigation, thus, has a fabrication protocol of shortened processing-
duration, native amorphous oxide-free, metal-rich air stable product that leads to 10 g
of composite product for fuel applications.
