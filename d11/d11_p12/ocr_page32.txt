nucleation, growth and grown features respectively, in the absence of any crystal
growth mechanistics.

In the present context, the feasible way to provide a mechanistic understanding
of crystal growth is to employ an appropriate tool that facilitates crystallization. One is
the utilization of the TEM electron beam (e-beam) irradiation. There are many reports of
localized crystallization under TEM e-beam [402]-[406]. The progress of amorphous to
crystalline phase transition under TEM e-beam is divided into two categories. These
are; (1) (beam energy is large to overtake displacement energy) the crystallization is
achieved by the creation/annihilation of point defects and inducing increased atomic
mobility [404], [407]-[409], or (2) (for lower beam energy not sufficient for creating
atomic displacements) crystallization gets initiated at the amorphous to crystalline
interface with the breaking of incorrectly formed interfacial bonds and subsequently
rearranges itself to regular crystalline order [403], [410]-[415]. The reason for athermal
nature of this TEM e-beam induced crystallization and also why an amorphous (of high
relative internal energy) material ends up into an ordered crystalline structure under
continuous e-beam impetus can be found elsewhere [402], [416], [417]. Computed
experimental data suggest to create point defects in crystalline Al displacement energy
of 19 eV is required corresponding to 210 keV primary TEM e-beam [418]. But in the
present case of amorphous material having differing local environment than its
crystalline form, the displacement energy can be as low as 10 eV [419]. Therefore having
200 keV TEM e-beam operating at step-4 emission mode with well above the predicted
displacement threshold energy is expected to create the required effect. It suggests
achieved amorphous to crystalline transition is dominantly controlled by point defects
creation and annihilation, thereby falls in category 1, as stated. With this brief TEM e-
beam irradiation, an athermal crystallization enhancement (DOC increase) tool
appropriate to mimic the actual Al crystal growth observed by sonication generated SH
can be simulated.
