Fig.4 12 [Sonocrystallization of PVP at RT]: Obtained RTSC/3PVP-2Al1 composite
XRD pattern plotted with crystal structure generated patterns below for
developed peak phase identification.
In the designed RTSC/3PVP-2Al composite product, the PVP crystallized GC fraction
structural phase identification is made employing Match! - program [389]. The
fabricated GC structural phase has a match (i.e, the identified file is of the highest
figure of merit) with that of the reference ICDD PDF-2: 89-7213 file with expanded C-
axis. To reaffirm this further, the crystallographic information file (CIF) generated XRD
patterns are included in the plot as Graphitic Carbon (GC) _generated in fig. 4 12. A
perfect match between GC_ generated with that of the GC phase of the fabricated
RTSC/3PVP-2Al composite product is elucidated for observation. Also, in continuation
of the earlier discussions, the reference ICDD PDE-2 file: 04-0787 identified in the
previous sections, remains the perfect match for the metallic Al phase representing the
other composite fraction. This metallic Al structural phase fraction can be seen as in the
initial stage of nucleation, having very well intercalated into its surface stabilizing GC
