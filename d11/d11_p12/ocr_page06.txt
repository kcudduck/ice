4.1 Introduction

The widespread applicability of ultrasound under environmentally benign conditions
delivering industrial scale product quality enrichment and production is fascinating.
The areas of application include: food science and its associated technology (processing,
preservation and extraction) development [54]-[60], water remediation [61]-[66],
biomedical field [67]-[69], and also the process intensification of variety of processes
[59], [70]-[73], etc respectively. It is a demonstrated fact that ultrasound-assisted
protocol is more effective than that its corresponding conventional (physical, chemical,
and biological) approach [74], [75]. In this context, the use of ultrasound in process
intensification to deliver organometallic complexes (e.g., organo-lithium, -magnesium,
and â€”aluminum, etc.) can be traced back as early as the 1950s, demonstrating its utility
[76]. A few well known specific cases of metals activation by ultrasound leading to
substantially shortened reaction duration (sonic acceleration) demonstrations of
synthetically significant protocols are; (1) Zinc-induced Reformatsky reaction [77], (2)
Copper-induced Ullmann couplings [78], and (3) Lithium-induced Barbier reaction [79],
respectively. In addition to the specific cases, the principles of ultrasound-induced
activation of metals and its use in accelerating (process intensification) organic
synthesis are reported in terms of book chapters [80]-[84]. The point being ultrasound-
induced shortened-in-time synthetic protocol development is an ongoing aspect. It is
worth noting here that the ultrasound-induced cavitation and its cavitation impulsive
collapse generated mechanical effects (like liquid microjets, turbulent mixing, shock
waves, and acoustic streaming) are the dominant phenomena responsible for these
synthetic process sono acceleration [85].

Since its invention in 1927, sonocrystallization is another significant physio-
chemical process of ultrasonic sonochemistry [86]-[89]. Investigations on possible
mechanistic reasoning of sonocrystallization are actively ongoing. The question whether
