A detailed guideline for liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) employing ultrasonication and
its slightly modified, adapted techniques for 2D-layered materials published elsewhere
is followed [341]-[348]. Three notable reasons delivering LPE identified are; (1)
cavitational bubble collapse leading to stemming generated mechanical energy in the
form of compressive/tensile stress wave in an unbalanced manner to overturn the
inbuilt layers attraction, resulting exfoliation, (2) shock waves breaking bulk into thin
flakes, (3) cutting of flakes due to frictional force resulting from high strain rates up to
10° s1, and (4) combination of all these processes acting simultaneously respectively. In
the present case, the fragmentation of PVP layers is achieved in hexadecane (Sonics
VCX 750W, 13 mm solid ultrasonic horn is used at 50 % amplitude) ultrasonic irradiated
for 2 and 4 hrs respectively. The non-contact DFM mode observation in both
topography and phase shown in figs. 4 7 (a)-(d), imply thickness almost approachable
