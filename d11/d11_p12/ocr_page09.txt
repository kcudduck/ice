process still runs over several hours resulting in non-uniform larger particle size, scale-
up limitations, and energy content inefficiencies [312]-[315]. The inorganic case
(protocol-1) is the most utilized conventional case left to be investigated employing
heterogeneous sonochemistry as standalone stimulation for process intensification
studies.

4.2 Materials and Methods

Chemicals and precursors used in this chapter are of Analytical Reagent (AR) grade.
Chemicals received from the different vendors are used without any further
purification. Aluminum chloride (AlCls, Reagent plus (R), 99%), Lithium Aluminum
Hydride (LiAlH4, pellets, Reagent grade, 95%), Poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, molecular
weight 10,000), n-Hexadecane (CHs (CH2)1sCHs, anhydrous, 99%), and UHP Argon are
used. Glassware related accessories cleaned by standard laboratory procedures, and the
nitrogen glove box is used to handle moisture-sensitive chemicals.

Sonochemical processing is carried out with Sonics VCX-750 watt ultrasonic
processor. Sonochemical reaction vessel (40-250 mL processing capacity, three 14/20
side necks, glass chamber height 62 mm), with the adapter (Part number: 830-0014) is
screwed into the special long full-wave solid probe (Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, 13 mm
tip, 245 mm long) at the nodal point. The glass sonochemical reaction vessel slides on
the adapter and is fixed in a place as required by the bushing which is screwed into the
reaction vessel, with an O-ring compress. The reaction vessel movement on the adapter
facilitates the probe portion extension out of the adapter required to be immersed into
the sample. A continuous mode of operation for 2 hrs (process control from 1s to a
maximum of 10 hrs) processing is carried out with ice water (20 Â°C) circulation based on
the requirement. The UHP argon bubbling at 30 bubbles /minute is also maintained
