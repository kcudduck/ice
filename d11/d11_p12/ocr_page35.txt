observed clear brighter spots in TEM DF imaging mode all over the GC flake validates
the crystallinity of embedded nanoparticulate. The entire GC flake portion acquired in
TEM SAED mode validates nanoparticulate entities to Al structural phase ring indexing
(see fig. 4 17 (c)). Sequential e-beam irradiated RTSC/PVP-Al composite portion after 0,
2.5, and 5 minutes exposure is shown in figs. 4 17 (d)-(f) validates crystal growth and
supports particle attachment. TEM e-beam electron transparency in the HR-TEM
micrographs of figs. 4 17 (d)-(f) to classify whether the particle attachment is OR or OA
scheme. Another GC flake already once E4I5M irradiated having a comparatively larger
10-15 nm size is chosen for crystal growth observation. One of the edge portions of the
flake having 9 Al nanocrystallites is shown in fig. 4 18 (b). Subsequent E412.5M
exposure few smaller ones disappear, highlighting coarsening of smaller ones
coarsening by OR scheme. This is further illustrated in a still larger particulate marked
as-1 is shown in fig. 4 18 (d). The OR of particles 2, 3, and simultaneous growth and
evolution of particle-1 shape is in support of OR, leading to Al crystal growth. This
physical evidence demonstrated under TEM e-beam is consistent with literature on
metallic particles crystal growth by ultrasonic induced head-on collision facilitated
agglomeration, particle fusion by melting, and coalescence [350]-[355]. The similarity
being both (TEM e-beam and Ultrasonic) Al crystal growth is by classical OR
mechanism. The difference being that the first is athermal, while in the second, localized
temperature rise above melting resulting coalescence is the proven reasoning.
