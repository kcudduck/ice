Fig.4 13 [Expandable GC]: (a) schematic of Graphite unit cell and its generated
XRD pattern (b) change in unit cell density versus lattice expansion as stress-
strain curve, and (c) physical shape of stress-stain curve adopted from
Wikipedia respectively.
Thereby in the elastic region, observation the stress versus strain proportionallity
behavior observation is analogously extended to the material density changes brought
in by c-axis elongation. This presumption is correct until no external mass flows into or
out of this hexagonal carbon unit cell (GC, crystal system- hexagonal, space group
number-194, space group symbol-P63/mmc) is strictly prohibited. That is, elongation
proportionally reduces unit-cell density. Based on this fact, both the c-axis elongation
and corresponding possible density changes of a variety of GC unit-cells are plotted in
fig. 4 13 (b). The expansions of these GC unit-cells are with respect to the ICDD PDEF-2:
89-7213 standard file. The set of expandable GC unit cells utilized are tabulated in
Table-1 taken from “The material project: A material genome approach to accelerating
material innovation” [398]. Two implications of this correlation are; (1) a nonlinear
