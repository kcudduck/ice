Fig4 9 [Sono-agglomeration]: (a)-(d) Al mesocrystal, (b), (c), (e¢) TEM-SAED
characterization, and (f) TEM e-beam de-agglomeration respectively.
Ultrasonic de-agglomeration is a frequently observed event, but literature on materials
agglomeration during sonochemical processing is not rare. Ultrasonic’s during
sonoprocessing in generating agglomeration of metallic particles investigated by Suslick
and group et al. had two interesting outcomes [350]-[355]. They are; if (1) particles
collide head-on, the result is agglomeration, otherwise; (2) glancing angle collisions lead
to surface oxide layer cracking and thereby its loss, respectively. In case of Al
nanoparticles the surface oxide layer is a hindrance for its use as fuel; hence its growth
is favorably inhibited (stated outcome 2) during sonoprocessing bringing about a
positive development. The mesocrystalline Al formulations are shown in TEM BEF/DF
images in figs. 4 9 (a) and (d) are the implication of presented outcome 1. Likewise,
TEM-SAED acquired, as shown in figs. 4 9 (c) and (e) is that of the Al structural phase.
The identified zone axis from the experimental SAED implies a lattice mismatch of less
than 2 % between that of the standard ICDD PDF: 04-0787 and experimental obtained
