Synthesizing oxide-free Al nanoparticles stabilized in the PVP matrix, in gram
quantities, for fuel application is the key objective. In doing so, the sonication induced
“process intensification” activity is to be evaluated. Therefore one of the previously
optimized Al chemical synthetic protocols is considered for experimentation. But an
additional ultrasonic probe introduced to achieve “process intensification”. There is
published literature illustrating the specific chemical synthetic protocol to be replicated
[365]-[367]. In order to have assertive quantification of the “process intensification” in a
quantitative term a physical variable namely “degree of crystallinity (DOC)” linked to
the crystalline Al diffracting volume fraction is chosen [368]-[370]. It is the integrated
intensity of the crystalline Al diffracting component to that of the total integrated
intensity of both the crystalline Al and amorphous PVP fractions. The process followed
