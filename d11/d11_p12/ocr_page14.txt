notable PVP polymer surface observed attributes are; (1) surface rupture, and (2)
evolved randomly distributed crystalline features presence respectively. The first aspect
is mechanical, a physical activity termed as sonofragmentation [329]-[336]. While the
second feature highlights ultrasound application in solution mediated materials
crystallization (otherwise known as sonocrystallization) processes, respectively [337]-
[340].

growth and embedding, and (c)-(f) aggregation respectively.
The major sonochemical attributes encountered are schematically presented as shown
in figs. 4 5 (b)-(d). To achieve these, the impulsive bubble collapse impetus driven
ultrasonic mechanochemistry is depicted in fig. 4 6 (a). TEM BF images, of ultrasonic
irradiation hexadecane solvent medium processed products, acquired justify these
occurrences are displayed in figs. 4 5 (a)-(f) respectively.
