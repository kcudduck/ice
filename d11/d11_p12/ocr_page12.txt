edges to the center. The TEM-SAED recorded from these layers has the characteristic
halo-disc shape of amorphous materials. One such localized region with SAED aperture
and obtained SAED pattern are shown in figs. 4 2 (e), and (f), respectively. The PVP
material is stable under step-2 TEM e-beam investigation used for probing, as evident
from lack of changes to these layers surface microstructures in the present illustrations.
Based on the current TEM-BF study (figs. 4 2 (b)-(e)) and literature, a representative
schematic of PVP lumps concurrent with the observations is overlaid on tig. 4 2 (f) as
inset [316].

3D-topography, and (b) corresponding phase contrast image (arrows indicate

lump wall) respectively.
Ethanol solvent dispersed PVP spin-coated on to a silicon substrate is imaged by
employing the non-contact dynamic force microscopy (DFM) mode in an AFM. PVP
lumps 3D view is acquired to support TEM 2D observations depicting no contrast. A
larger PVP globule is chosen, and its acquired 3D topography is shown in fig. 4 3 (a).
Acquired globule represents one TEM lump and is about micron thick, thereby non-
transparent to TEM e-beam, hence is of darker contrast. Many micron-sized smaller
spherical aggregates constituting this lump can be seen in topography, but are recorded
with better contrast for differentiation in the phase image shown in fig. 4 3 (b) [317]-
[319]. The existing individual aggregate walls are of 100-400 nm thick and are marked
