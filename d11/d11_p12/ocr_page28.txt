cubic power law is the best fit (red curve, x? =0.999) to the entire dataset considered,
when there is mass flow into the unit cell. That is, once the number of carbon atomic
sites in the unit cell is increased from z=4 to z=12. The physical appearance of both the
plots of fig. 4 13 (b) and (c) becomes analogous. (2) A linear fit is the best fit (blue line, y?
=0.999) untill the GC lattice expansion reaches 55 % (proportional limit); and the
number of GC atomic site is maintained at z=4. An unit cell expansion of less than 55 %
is recoverable, and the expandable graphite is in the elastic region. In the fabricated
RTSC/PVP-Al composite do=7.66 A (see Fig.4.10 GC_ generated) represents 48 %
elongation, thereby is in the elastic region. One-to-one correspondence employing fig. 4
13 (b) plots, it is estimated that the expanded GC density must be 1.17 g/cm?. Thereby
the material project mp-99182 file represents the ideal current sonocrystallized
expanded GC unit cell parameters.

This illustration of the soft and expandability feature of the GC, by bringing a
correlation with well-established materials stress-strain plot is most illustrative. This
