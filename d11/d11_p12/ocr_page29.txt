analysis also stands in justification and support of its broad applicability to the field of
batteries as an electrode material, where repeated charging and discharging are linked
to reversible expansion/ contraction of graphite composite electrodes [399]-[401].
4.4.3 Intercalation of metallic Al in sonocrystallized GC and PVP Matrix
composite
The sonication generated self-heating (SH) is utilized as one of the effective means to
facilitate nanocrystalline Al growth, suitably embedded, and stabilized in the
sonocrystallized GC and PVP Matrix fraction delivering required 1:1= polymer(P) to
metal(M) composite. A quantifying parameter, i.e., “degree of crystallinity” (DOC)
representing only the Al crystalline phase fraction, is evaluated to justify the synthesis
of the desired composite. For example, the P: M=1:1, 4:1 composites based on the
definition must have DOC of about 50 and 20 % of Al, respectively. The XRD data are
shown in fig. 4 14 highlights two distinguishable processing aspects; (1) PVP fraction
sonocrystallization at RT, (2) metallic Al crystal growth utilizing the bulk heating
generated by the continuous mode 2 hrs sonochemical processing. The Al grown phase
fraction reaches DOC= 49 % is as per the desired P: M=1:1 composite.
