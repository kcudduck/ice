4.5 Metallic Al Crystal Growth
The synthesized RTSC/PVP-Al composite having the least DOC=2 % of Al, is the
precursor chosen to illustrate the Al crystal growth. In fact the RTSC/PVP-Al composite
is having the Al phase is at its nucleating state (Al_Nucleation). To facilitate Al crystal
growth the sonochemical processing generated solution self heating is considered. The
80 °C reached with 1 h of processing is maintained another 1 h. A total 2 hrs of
processing at 80 °C increases the DOC to 17 % representing Al growth (Al_Growth). In
contrast 130 °C reached during 2 hrs of processing further increases DOC to 49 %,
almost approaching the 50 % theoretical DOC limit chosen. Therefore, the DOC=49 %
achieved product is identified as Al_Grown. Clearly these XRD quantitative DOC data
extracted from the product XRD patterns shown in fig. 4 14, can be identified with Al
