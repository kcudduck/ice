Reports of cavitational reactors delivered process intensification had many
demonstrations [320]-[328]. In this context, 20 kHz ultrasound pressure wave’s
irradiation generated mechanochemical alterations to PVP polymer are investigated
first. For this purpose, a 2 hrs long (previously optimized) ultrasound irradiation
processed PVP polymer product transferred onto TEM grids are imaged. Sonochemical
vessel of 250 mL capacity with 1.08 g of PVP at its bottom is ultrasonic irradiated
(Sonics VCX 750W, 13 mm solid ultrasonic horn is used at 50 % amplitude) through
hexadecane solvent as pressure wave transmitting medium. Out of many, the specific
effects of ultrasonic irradiation generated signatures of importance specific to the
current study observations are shown in figs. 4 4 (a)-(c) as TEM BF images. The two
