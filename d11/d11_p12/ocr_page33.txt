Fig4 16 [Nano-Al crystal nuclei]: synthesized RTSC/PVP-Al composite TEM
analysis.
The RTSC/PVP-Al composite having DOC=2 % representing Al is imaged in TEM-BF
mode, and the micrographs are shown in figs. 4 16 (a)-(c) respectively. GC in layer (fig.
4 16 (a)) and stacking (fig. 4 16 (b)) having 5-8 nm dark spots well embedded densely
packed and uniformly spread can be seen. One of the HR-TEM imaging of these dark
spots suggests dense liquid-like material embedding and its flow behavior, having no
signature of Al lattice fringes. The inset in fig. 4 16 (b) contains one such Al nucleus
(Al_nucleus) in HR-TEM observation. In order to facilitate crystal growth employing
TEM e-beam, the protocol schematized by the present author in the previous chapter-III
(section3.1.4) is followed [420]. In the TEM BF micrograph shown in fig. 4 14 (c), the
blue encircled region is TEM e-beam irradiated (E4I5M) for 5 minutes in HR-TEM mode
with step-4 LaBs electron emission current. The micrograph shown in fig. 4 16 (e) is the
e-beam irradiated region from which there is disappearance of black spots (liquid-like
containment), undergoes crystallization leading to the growth of spherical Al
