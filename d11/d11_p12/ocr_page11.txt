Fig.4 2 [Pristine PVP TEM observations]: TEM BF (a) lumps, (b)-(e) PVP layers,
and TEM SAED aperture, (f) characteristic halo disc pattern overlaid with PVP
as multilayered shell schematic as inset respectively.
PVP powder spread onto a TEM grid inside a nitrogen glove box is transferred to the
TEM sample holder immediately and is imaged. Irregular shape p-size bulky
aggregates of PVP macromolecules bulky aggregates confined to one of the TEM grid
square-mesh is shown in fig. 4 2 (a). Subsequent sequential increased magnification
TEM BF images are recorded and are shown in figs. 4 2 (b)-(d). Individual lumps (see
fig. 4 2 (a)) edge portions are imaged and depict layered morphology having smooth
(no crystallized or foreign entities as an embedded fraction) surface microstructure. The
increasing dark contrast (i.e., increased thickness) is a result of PVP macromolecules’
layered aggregation in sequential fashion when observed from any of the bulky lump
