direct indication of the tensile strain state of the Al phase as evaluated by the profile
fitting computation. No crystalline or amorphous characteristic of the oxide phase is
observed, indicating phase purity of synthesized nano-Al.
4.4.2 Sonocrystallization of PVP at RT
The sono-mechanochemical driven PVP graphitization (i.e., sonocrystallization) process
is investigated by using the bulk powder-XRD method. The analysis of such bulk XRD
data is a reaffirmation and validation of the presented TEM localized microstructural
graphitization. The specific outcomes being; (1) graphitized PVP fraction quantification,
(2) graphitized carbon structural parameters evaluation, and (3) developed structural
phase identification, respectively. A set of the sonochemical designed composites of x
wt% PVP/y wt% Al (denoted as xPPVP-yAl; where x/y=1/1, 2/1, and 4/1) products are
processed. The XRD pattern of RT sonicated 3PVP-2Al composite (denoted as
RTSC/PVP-Al) concurrent to the present discussion is plotted along with the parent-
PVP in fig. 4 12.
The amorphous parent-PVP has characteristic broad humps at 20=11.6 and 20.2 °,
respectively [377]-[380]. The broad hump at 20=20.2 ° develops to a sharpened peak
implying PVP crystallization, along with its simultaneous structural phase evolution to
graphitic carbon (GC) form. This process of crystallization and subsequent GC phase
formation is achieved by probe sonication at RT in solution-phase chemical processing
of the RTSC/PVP-Al composite product. The mechanistics of the ultrasonic pressure
waves devised crystallization is similar to that observed under laser or electron beam
[381]-[388]. The XRD pattern of RTSC/PVP-Al composite also highlights the process of;
(1) intercalation, (2) growth, and (3) stabilization of metallic Al nanoparticulate phase
achieved in the designed crystallized matrix of PVP and GC respectively.
