generates a crystalline building unit, which subsequently grows by further coalescence
based on the duration of sonoprocessing.
4) To validate Al crystals growth by building unit coalescence, Al-rich compositions
with Al (M)/ PVP (P) ratio higher than 1:1 ratio investigated indicates building units
sono-agglomeration. In this case, the reduced fraction of PVP surfactant offers less
hindrance to agglomerate almost 10 nm Al cubes in sidewise fashion to deliver around
359 nm Al 2D-large lumps devoid of an oxide phase. When exposed to TEM e-beam, the
de-agglomeration of individual building units is observed.
5) In the case of Al (M)/ PVP (P) fraction= 1:1, the sono-agglomeration of nano-Al
building units is actively suppressed by the PVP fraction to deliver approximately 15
nm Al crystallites densely packed inside the PVP matrix. The degree of crystallinity of
the Al phase as expected is 56 % (XRD extraction), slightly above the theoretical
expected 50 % in line with the composite fraction considered.
6) The arrangement/attachment of nano-Al crystals at the edges of the GC indicates
almost all the major features linked to the Al phase like; nucleation, coalescence, and
growth mostly happen in the n-hexadecane medium. Simultaneous gradual embedding
of grown nano-Al crystals into the GC layers results in intercalation, and leading
thereby its c-axis expansion.
7) The crystal structural data of the expandable GC extracted indicates that its
expansion is 48 % higher with respect to the standard ICDD structure, to accommodate
56 % nano-Al fraction.
8) The generated composite is air-stable, Al-rich with no amorphous surface oxide and
is expected to have many years storability making it suitable for fuel applications.
9) Finally, the conventional protocol-1, which requires around 16 hrs processing time, is
brought down to just 2 hrs highlights another demonstration to sonic-assisted process
intensification activity.
