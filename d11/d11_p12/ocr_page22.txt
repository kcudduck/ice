is to estimate DOC of the products is to employ Rietveld whole-pattern fitting method.
Bruker AXS TOPAS (Total Pattern Analysis Solution) Version 5 program is used [371]-
[373]. For analysis, the XRD broad signal from the amorphous phase is fitted with a split
pseudo-Voigt (SPV) function. The peak position, the area, the left, and right FWHM,
and the Lorentz fraction for the left and right SPV profiles are refined. The area under
the curve of the SPV function is used as an effective scale factor for the amorphous
phase.

The reflection profiles of crystalline phases are fitted with profile generated by
fundamental parameter approach (FPA), most suited for diffractometer using Bragg-
Brentano geometry [374]. The background intensity is modeled by Chebychev
polynomial of °th order with 1/X background checked implemented in TOPAS. The
implementation of this is subsequently done, but the synthetic chemical protocol to
deliver Al rich fractions is attempted first. Those three Al (M)/ PVP (P) compositions to
having Al theoretical DOC (T) ot 80, 66, and 50 % are synthesized. Out of these, the 1:1
Al-PVP composite having DOC (T) =50 % has the smallest average Al particle size of
(15.619) nm. Thereby this composite is the material of choice for subsequent further
studies. The details of particle size distributions of these three Al-rich composites
counted out of their corresponding TEM-BF images are shown in figs. 4 10 (a)-(f). It is
significant to note that using intensified ultrasound-assisted approach to deliver
nanostructured Al; (1) [bottom up chemical processing employing Al precursor] require
30 minutes of processing time [375], whereas in (2) [top down processing employing Al
foil] takes almost 36 hrs [376]. Thus, in the ongoing experimentation, the ultrasonic
“process intensification” brings down the sole chemical processing protocol from 24 hrs
to just 2 hrs, based on DOC=50 % quantification for 1:1 Al-PVP composite.
