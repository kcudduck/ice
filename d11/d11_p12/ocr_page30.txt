Fig.4 14 [Intercalation of metallic Al]: Metallic Al nucleation and growth by 2hrs
sonication generated self heating (SH). Composite processed at RT
(RTSC/PVP-Al), 80 °C (SHSC/PVP-ALl), 130 °C (SHSC/PVP-Al) respectively.
It is pertinent to mention here that two sonochemical SH temperatures 80 ° C and 130
°C respectively, reached after 1 h and 2 hrs of processing, are utilized for Al crystal
growth. Also, to illustrate DOC values computation, two processed P: M fraction XRD
data (Yxrd) is shown in fig. 4 15. The CIF of the identified crystallized structural phases
of GC, PVP, and Al are used to generate the whole XRD pattern. Each structural phase
is refined, and the individual peak phase is generated using fundamental parameters
profile fitting (FPPF) approach [374]. The extracted DOC of 56 and 22 % are as per the
fraction of 1:1 and 4:1 chosen for P: M, respectively. The obtained final profile fit (Yca),
the difference pattern (Yxd-Yai), and along with goodness of fit index (yx?) is shown in
fig. 4 15 (a), (b).
