proposed based on nucleation and growth aspects. This is a consequence of ultrasound
assist in delivering sufficient mechanical energy to overcome the local energy barrier to
trigger a small crystalline nuclei nucleation [337]. The evolved crystalline nuclei act as
the seed for the subsequent growth of large nanofibers. In this context, consistent with
many previous reports, experimental validation highlighting PVP crystallization to
graphitic carbon (GC) is shown in figs. 4 8 (a)-(b). Initiation of onion-like stripes after 1
h (see tig. 4 8 (a)) and filling of such stripes all over the PVP surface (see fig. 4 8 (b)) atter
2 hrs of ultrasonication in hexadecane is observed. The TEM microstructural data from
these generated structures locally in HR-TEM (see figs. 4 2 (d)-(f)) and SAED (tig. 4 8
(e)) mode confirms PVP crystallization. The microstructural data extraction and
schematic presentation of the same shown in figs. 4 8 (c)-(e), indicates hexagonal GC
along with c-axis tensile strained in comparison with that of the standard ICDD PDF-2:
89-7213 tile.
