                       ABSTRACT. The association between basal hydrology and glacier sliding has become nearly
                       synonymous with the early work of Almut Iken and colleagues. Their research published in the Journal
                       of Glaciology from 1981 to 1986 made an indelible impact on the study of glacier hydromechanics by
                       documenting strong correlations between basal water pressure and short-term ice-flow variations. With
                       a passion for elucidating the physics of glacier-bed processes, Iken herself made fundamental
                       contributions to our theoretical and empirical understanding of the sliding process. From the theoretical
                       bound on basal shear stress, to the inferences drawn from detailed horizontal and vertical velocity
                       measurements, the work of Iken and colleagues continues to inform the interpretation of data from
                       alpine glaciers and has found increasing relevance to observations from the ice sheets.

          pressurized water, pointing to the dominant influence of
          water pressure on glacier sliding speed. They came to this
          conclusion by systematically ruling out the following as
          leading explanations for the observed uplift: temporal
          variations in longitudinal strain rate, increases in glacier
          volume due to crevasse formation, expansion of intra-
          granular veins and dilatation of subglacial sediments. This
          rigorous approach to attribution was characteristic of Iken’s
          work throughout her career. In seeking to explain how a
          minimum of 0.3 m of water could be stored in cavities at the
          bed without precipitating unstable sliding, Iken and others
          (1983) calculated that sinusoidal undulations of 0.56 m in
          amplitude covering most of the glacier bed could accom-
          modate the water; however, they speculated that the cavities
          were probably more compact than this and perhaps
          asymmetric in shape, with more steeply inclined stoss faces.
          The data in Figure 2 have become the classical empirical
          demonstration of ‘hard-bedded’ sliding.

          Observed water-pressure effect on sliding (Iken and
          Bindschadler, 1986)
          Iken and Bindschadler (1986) put the theoretical under-
          pinnings of basal sliding (e.g. Lliboutry, 1968, 1979; Kamb,
          1970; Iken, 1981; Fowler, 1986) to the test with simul-
          taneous measurements of borehole water level and surface
          velocity at Findelengletscher. This temperate valley glacier,
          located in the Pennine Alps of Switzerland, was chosen
          because of its observed sensitivity to changes in water input                     Fig. 2. Detailed theodolite measurements of glacier movement
