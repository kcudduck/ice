Sonoluminescence   and reactions   in cavitation A review  MA   MARGULIS  sonochemical fields.  Contemporary   ideas   on the   nature   of cavitation   are reviewed   in this   paper.   The general   theories   of sonoluminescence   and   sonochemical   reactions,   the   origin, stability   and   splitting   of cavitation   bubbles,   the   dynamics   of cavitation   field evolution,   the   peculiarities   of cavitation   effects   at low   intensity   and   low- frequency   acoustic   oscillations,   the   sonoluminescence   quenching   effect   and some   questions   on the   energetics   of cavitation   fields   are discussed.   The electrical   theory   of the   splitting   of cavitation   bubbles   may, as shown   in the   paper, become   an alternative   to the   thermal   theories   of cavitation   in the   future.  KEWVORDS:   ultrasonics,   cavitation,   bubble   dynamics,   sonoluminescence  Introduction  The   phenomenon   of cavitation.   which   was   discovered more   than   a century   ago.   now   attracts   the   attention   of many   scientists   by its multifaceted   and   contradictory aspects   as well   as the   constantly   appearing   interesting and   sometimes   mysterious   discoveries   on   the   subject. In the   1960s. after   general   publications   on   powerful cavitation   fieldsle3.   sonochemical   reactions4-6.   and sonoluminescencti-‘,   ‘harmony’   was   established   in this   area   between   experimental   and   theoretical   results. However,   since   about   1975 the   number   of publications on   these   problems   has   sharply   increased   and   in   the past   decade   a number   of results   have   been   obtained which   require   the   refinement   of many   deep-seated ideas   on   the   nature   of cavitation.

The   reaction   of zinc with   o-dibromoxylene,   flowing   in   an   ultrasonic   field, generates   xylylene   radicals   which   give   tetrahydro- naphthalenes   by reaction   with   olefins’*.   In   an ultrasonic   field,   the   increase   in the   rate   of acetaldehyde oxidation   is accompanied   by substantially   increased light   emission   (probably,   recombination   light)lg. To   understand   the   mechanism   of chemical   and physicochemical   interactions   of ultrasound,   it is necessary   to establish   coherent   concepts   of the   nature of cavitation.   The   present   review   is concerned   with general   problems   on   the   dynamics   of cavitation evolution   and   modern   ideas   on   the   mechanism   by which   sonoluminescence   and   sonochemical   reactions occur.  Loss of stability   and   splitting   of cavitation bubbles  The   dynamics   of a single   cavitation   bubble   are described   by the   equations   of Rayleighz4,   Noltingk- Neppiras”,   Herring-Flynn’   and   Kirkwood-Bethe1,26. These   equations   postulate   that   the   bubble   retains   its spherical   shape   before   a collapse.   These   problems   have been   discussed   in detail   in   reviews’-3.20-23   and   will   not be treated   in   this   paper.

reaction   rate   and   sonoluminescence   intensity   for different   gases   in   solution   with   similar   CJC,   is governed   by the   heat   conduction   of gases.   However, discussion   of heat   conduction   is irrelevant   when considering   the   adiabatic   collapse   of a cavitation bubble.   involving   excitation   and   dissociation   of molecules:   after   the   collapse,   when   the   bubble   has disappeared_   discussing   heat   conduction   of gases   is also   irrelevant. Heat   conduction   and   gas   dynamics   in   a collapsing bubble   are   taken   into   acccount   by   Refs 2t( and   29. At the   same   time.   another   important   factor.   liquid compressibility.   should   be taken   into   consideration using   the   Herring-Flynn   equation.   However.   the equations   of Ref. 2X   cannot   bc applied   in combination with   the   Kirkwood-Bethe   equations   because   the assumption   of an   isoentropic   shift   of the   shock   wave front   is the   basic   prerequisite   of the   thee@. None   of the   proposed   models   of cavitation   bubble collapse   have   so far been   able   to take   into consideration   jointly   liquid   compressibility.   heat exchange.   change   of mass   of the   vapour-gas   mixture* in the   bubble.   etc.   Limiting   evaluations   of the   effects   of phase   transitions.   straightened   gas   diffusion.   and   heat transfcr’~3’,27   for small   pulsations   make   it impossible   to study   these   phenomena   when   the   bubble   contracts sharply. The   vapour-gas   mixture   in   a   cavitation   bubble   is generally   considered   as   an   idcal   gas;   this   causes  significant   errors   at high   pressures.   Howcvcr,   the   use   of the   van   der   Waals   equation   of state   would   significantly complicate   the   equations   and   numerical   calculations. As a rule.   the   dynamics   of a single   bubble   arc investigated   without   considering   the   interaction   01 bubbles   in   the   cavitation   field.   Rosenber$   has   shown that   one   may   ignore   the   effect   of Bernoulli’s   pressure. which   develops   between   bubbles.   At the   same   time.   in our   opinion.   a much   greater   contribution   is provided by the   interaction   involving   the   Bjerkness3*   and  KGni$’   forces   that   arise   between   pulsing   bubbles. The   dynamics   equations   describe   the   pulsation   ancl  collapse   of spherical   cavitation   bubbles.   Theoretically, vibrations   of   a   bubble   similar   in   siL.e to the   resonance sir.c result   in the   bubble’s   quick   contraction,   crushing  and   disappearance   in the   liquid   (collapse).   However.   in recent   years   studies   have   revealed   other   cxpcrimental results:   deformation   of the   spherical   shape   of the bubble.   its loss   of stability,   and   degradation   into   a number   of fragmentation   bubbles**.   Plesset and   Mitchell33 have   established   a stability   condition   for the   spherical form   of   a   bubble.   Theoretical   studies   of the   motion   of deformed   bubbles   are   based   on   the   general   dynamics equations.   in which   the   radius   of a non-spherIcal bubble.

Experimental   studies   have   shown   that   the   pulsation   ot cavitation   bubbles   gives   rise   to annula?’   and   radial cumulative   jets   near   the   surface   (Fig.   I). This   is accompanied   by the   splitting   of cavitation   bubbles. One   of the   new   and   promising   techniques   in   studying the   movement   and   interaction   of cavitation   bubbles   is to induce   cavitation   by   focused   beams   of laser   radia- tion   (optical   cavitation).   ‘Laser’   cavitation   bubbles   may be created   at predetermined   points   and   a desired instant   of time. Lauterborn   ct al35 investigated   these   bubbles   by means of conventional   and   holographic   rapid   filming   at  frame   frequencies   of   IO6 s-’   and   3 X IO4 s-‘. respcctivcly.   A cavitation   bubble   pulsing   at ;I distance of4-5   maximum   radii   from   the   solid   surface   under- goes   a stage   of maximum   contraction   (‘collapse’)   and then   ejects   a thin   cumulative   jet   (at   a speed 01 -10   111 5-l)   in the   direction   of the   solid   wall (Fig.   I   b: Rcl: 3s.   p. 5). A bubble   of smaller   si/e interacts   with   a larger   one   in the   same   manner   as it does   with   the   wall:   it ejects   ;I thin   cumulative   jet   that penetrates   the   larger   bubble.   The   contraction   of laaet- cavitation   bubbles   and   the   radiation   of shock   waves can   be seen   in detail   in   Fig   2 (Ret:   35. p. 6).

Analysis   of photographs presented   in various   scientific   publications   has indicated   that   the   creation   of the   bubble   ‘roughnesses’ is characteristic   of processes   involving   rapid   bubble formation,   such   as instantaneous   heating   with   high electric   current   of a tungsten   filament.   followed   by a burst   of the   1attePO. electrical   breakdown   of a liquid4’. hydrodynamic   cavitation4*.   etc.   So far,   it is not   quite clear   why   these   micro-inhomogeneities   appear   and what   role   they   play   in cavitation   processes.   The   reason for their   creation   may   lie in   the   formation   of jets   of still   smaller   scale   (than   in   Refs   35 and   37). accom- panied   by   a slight   ‘tear’   of the   liquid   (under   the   effect of electric   charges   created   on   the   bubble’s   surface)   or by surface   waves   leading   to destabilization   of the bubble. We   may   assume   that   the ‘tension   bars’   appearing   in ultrasonic   fields   of great   intensity   (these   ‘bars’   are described   by   Rosenberg   in   Ref. 2, p. 225)   result   from the   interactton   of cavitation   bubbles,   followed   by the formation   of cumulative   jets   between   them.   According to the   analysis3g   of holograms   obtained   by Ebelir@, ultrasonic   fields   of 20 kHz   and   of moderate   intensity give   rise   to many   deformed   cavitation   bubbles.

The   technique   for creating these   fields*   is developed   in   Ref. 44. Very   low frequencies   have   been   proven   to allow   one   to create cavitation   in   liquids   and   observe   various   physico- chemical   and   chemical   effectP   characteristic   of ultrasonic   wave   action:   degassing.   emulsification, dispersion,   and   erosion   and   cleaning   of solid   body surfaceP,   as well   as sonoluminescence’*   and sonochemical   reactionP~48.  *   The   cumulative   jet   is   not   visible   in   the   third   frame   of   Fig.   2.   penetration of   the   bubble   possibly   occurs   earlier,   at   the   stage   of   its   concentration *   Low-frequency   oscillations   of   an   immersed   rod   were   unable   to   convey sufficient   power   to   the   liquid   because,   even   at   low   amplitudes,   vortex streams   arose   rather   than   tensile-compressive   stresses  ULTRASONICS.

Excitation   of a liquid   with   30-200   Hz   acoustic oscillations   results   in   the   gradual   formation   of a large deformed   bubble   (LDB)   of -1   cm   diameter,   to which the   rest   of the   bubbles   rush   under   the   action   of Bjerkness’s   forces.   Short   exposure   photography (0.002   s) has   revealed   that   the   LDB   is not   spherical (Fig.   3a.   b). Like   the   fragments   of a glassy   body.   the LDB   has   numerous   cracks,   cavities   and   projections, which   develop   in various   directions   at high   speed   and apparently   with   equal   probability.   This   can   explain why   an   LDB.   being   visually   observed   or photographed with   a long   time   exposure   (0.1 s). resembles   a spherical hedgehog   (Fig.   3~). When   the   power   was   increased   or the frequency   lowered.   the   LDB   began   to move   away   from the   oscillating   piston   to the   vessel   bottom.   When   the frequency   was   equal   to the   resonance   frequency   (for   a given   size   of LDB)   and   the   power   was   sufficiently   high, the   LDB   gradually   post   its stability.   When   contracting the   LDB   periodically   emitted   pulsed   liquid   streams (Fig.   4), similar   to the   cumulative   jets3s,37. which   were filled   with   fragmentation   microbubbles.   The   streams traced   out   complex   close   trajectories   and   rushed   back to the   LDB.   According   to the   results   of high-speed lilming4.   both   the   LDB   and   the   small   spherical bubbles   breaking   away   from   it pulse   within   an   acoustic oscillation   frequency.   In   no   case   was   the   effect   of a real collapse   (disappearance)   of the   bubble   observed. Until   recently,   sonochemical   reactions   were   carried   out at relatively   high   frequencies.   higher   than   10 kHz.   The chemical   effect   of low   frequency   acoustic   oscillations   is covered   in   Refs   11.47   and   48. At   14-80   Hz,   a bromine- sensitized   stereoisomerization   of maleic   acid   to fumaric acid   is initiated48,‘1.   The   maximum   reaction   rate,   as   in the   case   of 860   kHfg,   was   observed   in a solution saturated   with   argon;   saturation   with   nitrogen   or   air resulted   in   a signlflcant   decrase   in   fumaric   acid formation. At frequencies   of 70-80   Hz   or higher,   the   reaction   took place   only   under   the   conditions   of LDB   formation   and LDB   vibration   with   a sufficient   amplitude   that   a break-away   of small   bubbles   could   be provoked.   It is interesting   that   at   14-40   Hz,   the   precipitate   of fumaric acid   fell out   even   in   the   absence   of an   LDB.   When   this occurred.   intensive   surface   waves   arose   in the   liquid surface   (above   the   piston).   and   bubbles   of OS-2   mm diameter   separated   from   the   surface   and   sped   deep into   the   vessel   in vortex   streams.   The   reactions   could not   be   initiated   in the   absence   of the   bubbles.   Small pulsing*   bubbles   can   initiate   a sonochemical   reaction, whether   they   tear   away   from   the   LDB   or   from   a free liquid   surface. Low-frequency   acoustic   oscillations   of 7-200   Hz provoke   sonochemical   redox   reactions   in   aqueous solutions:   hydrogen   peroxide   synthesis.   ferrous sulphate   (II)   oxidation.   ceric(IV)   sulphate   reduction. etc.47,‘1. Sonoluminescence   in   a field   of low   frequency   acoustic oscillations   (IO-100   Hz)   proved   to be similar   in   many respects   to light   emission   in   a field   of ultrasonic   waves at low   intensities   (jump   likelihood   and   time irregularities   of the   sonoflash   amplitude). Thus   the   study   of low   frequency   sound   fields   has  *   Pulsation   of   the   small   bubbles   is   an   essential   condition   of   their   chemical activity   because   when   small   bubble   vortexes   were   produced   in   a   solution by   means   of   a   high   speed   agitator,   the   reaction   did   not   proceed  shown   that   there   are   two   types   of pulsing   cavitation bubbles:   small   spherical   bubbles   and   large   deformed bubbles.   the   former   being   able   to result   from   the splitting   of the   latter.   LDBs   effectively   interact   with pulsing   bubbles.   solid   body   surfaces.   and   interfaces   of immiscible   liquids.   Therefore,   the   movement   of an LDB   causes   dispersion   erosion,   emulsification,   and other   physicochemical   effects.   When   there   is no   LDB. the   small   pulsing   bubbles   are   unable   to produce   these effects.   The   splitting   of bubbles   and   the   formation   of small   spherical   bubbles   lead   to sonoluminescence   and sonochemical   reactions.   All   this   considered.   we can understand   why   the   rate   of erosion   and   the   rate   of sonochemical   reactions   have   different   temperature- dependencies   . j”.   the   maximum   activity   of LDBs   occurs at 50°C   while   LDB   splitting   becomes   more   effective with   a decrease   in   temperature. The   large   space   ( -   1 cm)   and   time   ( -IO-’   s) scales   of the   cavitation   phenomenon   at low   frequencies   enable   it to be comprehensively   investigated44-46.   For   instance, an   insight   has   been   gained   into   many   details   of the emulsification   and   coalescence   of slurries   in   an acoustic   field   as well   as into   the   nucleation,   growth, pulsation.   and   splitting   of bubbles.   The   procedure developed   permits   extensive   studies   of cavitation.   It should   also   be noted   that   the   two   types   of cavitation bubbles   are   also   observed   in   ultrasonic   fields   (at   least at 20 kHz).   The   LDB’s   loss   of stability   and   the   separa- tion   of small   bubbles   correspond   to the   formation   of new   cavitation   nuclei   in   ultrasonic   fields   and   the ‘multiplication’   of cavitation   bubbles.   At low   intensities, a volume   under   study   contains   one   or two   LDBs (without   spherical   bubbles),   while   at higher   intensities, the   number   of small   pulsing   bubbles   can   exceed   the number   of LDBs   by one   or two orders   of magnitude   or more.   The   transition   from   stable   to unstable   motion   of LDBs   at an   intensity,   I. of -0.5   W cm-*   proceeds   at a sudden   jump;   the   transition   is accompanied   by a sharp change   in   acoustic   field   structure   and   timbre   of acoustic   noise.  Dynamics   of cavitation   field   evolution  The   initial   definition   of cavitation   was   the   rupture   of liquid   as a result   of negative   (stretching)   pressures.   But the   resistance   to rupture   of real   liquids   is less   than theoretically   predicted_   by two   or three   orders   of magnitude.   because   microbubbles   and   other inhomogeneities   are   usually   present   in a 1iquid’J.   So we have   a contradiction:   during   the   appearance   of cavitation   no   rupture   of the   liquid   occurs.   but microbubbles   already   present   and   pulsing   in the   liquid grow.   Bubbles   which   do   not   appear   from   the   rupture   of the   liquid   are   usually   called   pulsing   cavitation   bubbles. We shall   consider   as cavitation   phenomena   the pulsation,   oscillation,   growth,   interaction   and   other kinds   of movement   of bubbles,   regardless   of their origin   and   the   effects   they   produce   (as   opposed   to Flynn’s   definition’).   when   low   and   then   high   pressures occur   in   a liquid.   To   overcome   the   contradiction   in terminology,   the   cavitation   threshold   (which   was   earlier regarded   as the   instant   at which   cavitation   began)   will from   now   on   be called   the   developed   cavitation threshold.   At this   instant   the   number   of cavitation bubbles   increases   suddenly   and   many   physicochemical effects   are   intensified. It was   found   by   improved   methods   that.   before   the  ULTRASONICS.   JULY   1985   161

At low,   near-threshold   acoustic   intensities.   the concentration   of cavitation   bubbles   is low.   and   it is possible   to observe   a number   of features   pertaining   to the   dynamics   of cavitation   region   evolution   as well   as to the   associated   fine   physicochemical   effects   which become   indistinguishable   at high   intensities. At low   intensities,   of the   order   of 0.06 W cnP’,   a delay (up   to I20   s) was   observed   in the   start   of lig.ht emission with   respect   to the   instant   when   the   ultrasound   had been   switched   on5’. The   llux   of sonoluminescence and   the   number   of observed   cavitation   bubbles,   at 0.03-O.

At moderate   intensities.   a hydrophone   made   it possible to discover   a periodic   increase   and   weakening   of cavitation5*.   This   process,   denoted   a pulsing   cavitation by Makarov   and   Neverov.   results   from   the   apparatus effect.   leading   to the   following   sequence   of processes: initiation   of developed   cavitation   and   decrease   in   the medium   wave   drag   detuning   of the   vibratory   system. decrease   in the   oscillation   rate,   and   the   transition   from developed   to prethreshold   cavitation.   If the   wave   drag rises   to its   initial   value,   this   relatively   lengthy   cycle repeats   itself.   and   so on. Let us examine   some   results   obtained   by   Margulis   and  Grundef   in   studying   the   light   emission   of a liquid   near the   developed   cavitation   threshold13.   Ultrasound   ot ‘0   kHz   was   switched   on   after   the   power   had   been preset   lower   than   the   threshold   power.   Then   the intensity   wils increased   in   steps   of 9-3   mW   cnP minimum   at time   intervals   of 3-10   min.

As the   intensity   of ultrasound.   1. increases.   the   counting   speed   curve gradually   deviates   from   the   value   corresponding   to the dark   current   of the   photomultiplier   (clushed   lint’).   At   a  certain   intensity   of ultrusounci   and   after   sufficient obscr\ation   time,   the   counting   speed   rose   sharply,   by approximately   one   or two orders   of magnitude*.   This ultrasound   intensity   may   be   interpreted   as :I threshold of de\cloped   cavitation.   I,,,. At this   instant   I,. conventional   post-threshold   sonoluminesconce   arises: the   observed   slight   light   emission   at t <   t,   is prethreshold   emission.   The   threshold   for this   slight light   emission   is less   pronounced   than   that   for the sonoluliiinescence.   The   prethreshold   light   emission increased   with   intensity   of ultrasound.   The   origin   of the   prcthreshold   light   may   be understood   as the   light emitted   by pulsing   ‘non-collapsing’   microbubbles.   the size   of which   is nc:lr   reson:mce’3. The   monotonic   increase   in prethreshold   light   with   I was   occasionally   accompanied   by ‘splashes’   of light (Fig.   5). momentary   (up   to several   seconds)   sharp increases   in   light   emission.   The   amplitude   and duration   of these   spontaneous   ‘splashes’   increased   with an   increase   in I, the   ‘splashes’   becoming   more   and more   frequent   with   increasing   I. and   longer observation   time,   as well   as when   the   instant   t,   was approached.   The   ‘splashes’   of light   are   probably   causcti by the   ‘collapse‘   (splitting)   of some   pulsing   sufficiently large   bubbles.   which   leads   to a chain   process   of bubble multiplication.   and   a sharp   increase   in   light   emission.

As a consequence.   ;I   stationary   bubble concentration   is not   reached.   Rare   short-term   ‘splashes‘ of light   may   also   be observed   at   a   low constant intensity   with   prolonged   observation.

At intensities   a little   higher   than   I,,   alld   for   t >   t,.  Margulis   and   Grundel’54   observed   large   and   frequent changes   in   the   number   of light   pulses   (by   one   or two orders   of magnitude)   fort   -   0.1 s: occasionally.   iii fell almost   to the   level   of the   prethrcshold   light   (Fig.   5). These   time   irregularities   of the   sonoflashes54   may   be accounted   for by   pulsations   of bubbles   for   a   long   time at low I (of the   order   of I,,,)   ~rnd   by the   occurrt‘nce   01 time   internals   (of   the   order   of many   thousand   cycles) when   practically   no   bubbles   ‘collapse’   in   the   photo- multiplier   tield   of view.

To   register   this,   it is better   to obtain   a ‘/zf’subharmonic component   of the   noise.   Comparison   of the   amplitude of this   subharmonic   with   the   light   intensity   has   shown that   there   is no   correlation   between   these   characteristic manifestations   of bubble   movement   in   an   ultrasonic ficlds4. either   near   the   developed   cavitation   threshold or at high   intensities.

Thus.   the bubble   movement   corresponding   to the   light   emission ULTRASONICS.   JULY   1985  is different   from   that   corresponding   to the   appearance of subharmonic   components,   and   the   increase   in I leads   to a change   in the   bubble   pulsation   character and   the   mechanism   of transferring   the   energy,   accu- mulated   by the   bubbles,   to the   system.   On   the   other hand.   the   instant,   t,.   that   developed   cavitation   starts (corresponding   to a jump   in N   is accompanied   in most   cases   by   a jump   in the   ‘/zf subharmonic. However,   the   instant   that   developed   cavitation   appears and   its activity   may   be   fixed   most   exactly   and   non- inertially   by   registering   sonoluminescence;   for small light   fluxes   one   should   register   the counting   speed. N, and for large   fluxes   the   photomultiplier   total   current.   This appears   to be the   first   practical   application   of sonoluminescence   in   these   techniques. The   term   ‘developed   cavitation   threshold’   is used   to denote   (a)   the   instant   that   cavitation   begins   and   (b)   the minimal   intensity,   Ith. which   gives   rise   to developed cavitation.   The   first   usage   is quite   natural,   but   the second,   despite   the   descriptiveness   of It,, and   the convenience   of its use   in   many   important   equations (see   below).   denotes   a rather   undefined   and   nearly irreproducible   parameter.   If fact, Ith depends   strongly on   the   length   of time   preceding   cavitation   evolution. the   size   of the   steps   by which   I increases,   the   volume and   homogeneity   of the   liquid   sample.   etc. Hence. neither   the   delinition   of f,h, nor   the   time   preceding cavitation   to which   I,,, corresponds   can   be established. Extrapolating   I,,, to an   indefinite   time   before   cavitation is impossible   because   of the   irreproducibility   of measurements   for different   liquid   samples   and   the sharp   decrease   in   the   developed   cavitation   strength   of a liquid   where   cavitation   has   arisen   if only   once. Since.   in   most   experiments.   the   liquid   is used   after   the beginning   of developed   cavitation.   the   equations describing   the   cavitation   field   energetics   have   an I,,, which   does   not   denote   the   liquid   initial   cavitation strength   at a slowly   increasing   I. but   the   strength.   I$,, of a ‘stationary’   liquid   in   which   developed   cavitation   has already   arisen.   As. generally.   I$, <   1. the   narrow   range of the   small   value   Is,!,   changes   the   difference   (I-f,,,)   to only   a small   extent.   (The   superscript   st will   be omitted from   1:: below.) The   existence   of the   prethreshold   light   emission   of a liquid   allows   the   conclusion   that   certain   sonochemical reactions   should.   in   principle,   occur   before   the developed   cavitation   threshold.   In   much   the   same   way as the   weak   prethreshold   light   emission   is super- imposed   on   the   sonoluminescence,   the   prethreshold sonochemical   reactions   run   in   parallel   with   conven- tionally   observed   ultrasound   chemical   reactions; however.   these   reactions   may   be detected   only   by special   experimental   procedures. The   chain   mechanism   of cavitation   bubble   multiplica- tion   was   first   hypothesized   by   Rosenberg   and Sirotyuk*.   Analysis   of available   experimental   data makes   it possible   to refine   many   of the   details   of this process   and   postulate   the   following   chain   of events   in a liquid   affected   by acoustic   oscillations:   pulsation   and growth   of microbubbles   in the   liquid   up   to the   rcso- nance   size   (for   one   reason.   as a result   of the   study   of low-frequency   acoustic   field?4-46.   because   of the coalescence   caused   by   Bjerkness   forces,   and   for another.   when   dissolved   gas   is sucked   in   because   of straightened   diffusion   5s,59); loss   of stability   of bubbles near   the   resonance   si7e:   bubble   destruction   and   sepa- 163

Spectral   studies   of sonoluminescence  An   extensive   study   of sonoluminescence   spectra   of water   and   salt   solutions   is presented   in   Ref. 61. The sonoluminescence   spectra   (Fig.   7) show   a continuum with   a broad   peak   between   300 and   400   nm.   with   lines and   bands   at 290, 310. and   340 nm   distorting   the   peak. The   continuum   peak   obtained   at 500 kHz   is located nearer   to the   UV region   than   that   obtained   at   16 kHz. When   replacing   the   gases   Ar,   Kr, Xe. the   peak sharpens   and   shifts   a little   to the   UV region.   The features   observed   in   the   spectrum   at 300 nm61.62 are classified   by Taylor   and   Jarman   as a transition, OH* (A2 E+) -OH(X2n)   t   hv   (5) which   is characteristic   of the   deactivation   of an   excited hydroxyl.   Generally,   OH*   is produced   by exciting water   up   to a level   of ‘A,.   The   three   weak   bands   in   a region   of -300   nm   are   referred   to transitions   between the   vibrational   levels   u (2,0.0)   and   u (1,O.l).   respectively. This   classification   of the   bands   is in   agreement   with papers   on   flame   spectroscopy.   The   band   (0.0) becomes more   intense   with   the   replacement   by the   gases   Xe, Kr. Ar.   and   the   lowering   the   frequency   from   500 to   16 kHz. We believe   that   the   increased   sharpness   at 300   nm   for 16 kHz   is accounted   for by the   longer   ‘life’ of the excited   OH*   (roH* -   1OP   s). In   fact.   at   16 kHz   the sonoflashcs   last   for about   0.1 T, =   6   x   IOP   s.   which   is greater   than   roH* (here   To is an   acoustic   oscillation period).   At 500 kHz,   0.1 To =   2   x   IO-’   s 4   rooH*.   and   a considerable   part   of the   OH*   has   no   time   to give   a  light   flash;   therefore.   the   intensity   of the   band   for OH* with   respect   to the   continuum   is lower   thaan   it is at 16   kHz. Salts   dissolved   in water   proved   not   only   to give intensive   characteristic   lines   of metals   in   the   spectrum. but   also   to change   the   entire   emission   spectrum   at low ultrasonic   frequencies.   particularly   in   the   red   region6’.  Ref.   63   explains   the   effect   of the   emission   of alkaline and   alkaline-earth   metal   lines   in a cavitation   fie1d64.6’. The   theoretical   results   of the   space-time   distribution   of temperature   (heat   exchange   considered)   in   a   contrac- ting   cavitation   bubble2 8,29 have   shown   that   at the   linal stage   of the   process.   lasting   less   than   1OP   s, heating occurs   of both   the   bubble   vapour-gas   mixture   and   the adjacent   area   ( -   1OP   cm   thick),   the   temperature   of the latter   reaching   -0.1   r,,   (T,,, is the   maximum   tempera- ture   at the   centre   of the   bubble).   The   parameters achieved   at the   boundary   between   the   bubble   and   the liquid   are   sufficient   for evaporation   of halide   salts.   A microquantity   of a salt,   for example   NaCI,   entrained   by the   vapour-gas   stream   inside   the   bubble,   suffices   to excite   metal   spectral   lines   when   heating;   analogous processes   are   provided   by   flames.   shock   tubes.   etc. This involves   elementary   processes   which,   for halide   salts, MeX   are   represented   by the   Terenin   equation:  E  MeX-Me*   +   X   (6) Me* -Me   t   hvMe   (7) For   process   (6). the   dissociation   and   excitation   of the degraded   product   are   involved   in one   elementary  ULTRASONICS.

All   the   studied   salts,   even   Rb,SO,   (which   itself gives   no   characteristic   lines),   suppressed   the   emission band   of OH*   in   the   sonoluminescence   spectrum;   this is attributed   to the   reactions Me   t   OH*-   Me*   t   OH   (8) Me   t   OH*-   MeOH   t   hv   (9) Peterson   and   AndersotY5   obtained,   during   hydro- dynamic   cavitation,   spectra   of light   emission   which were   blue-white   discrete   splashes.   The   spectra   proved to be   rather   flat   and   uniform   (Fig.   7)   and   did   not contain   either   lines   or   bands   (within   the   limits   of the resolution   of the   apparatus). Though   the   sonoluminescence   and   the   light   emission produced   by   hydrodynamic   cavitation   would   be expected   to be similar   in   nature.   the   spectrum   of the latter   (as   opposed   to that   of the   sonoluminescence) proved   to be different   from   black-body   emission.   As yet. the   reasons   for this   are   not   clear.   The   hydro- dynamic   light   emission   spectrum   might   have   a maximum,   but   in   a longer-wave   part   which   proved inaccessible   for the   equipment   used   in   Ref. 65.

Ref. 80 considers   a double   electrical   layer   adjacent   to the neck   that   results   from   the   separation   of fragmentation bubbles   from   a deformed   cavitation   bubble   pulsing   in the   acoustic   field.   its stability   being   lost   (Fig.   10). Immediately   adjacent   to the   bubble   surface,   one   may isolate.   as is known.   a dense   part   of the   double   layer and   a more   distant   diffusion   part   whose   ions   can   move along   with   the   liquid   stream.   Water   molecules   having   a dipole   moment   of -6   X   lO-3o   C   m. orientate themselves   in   the   surlace   layer   in   such   a manner   that an   average   of I/?() of their   total   amount   are   placed   with their   negative   poles   turned   towards   the   gas   phases’. Available   anions   interact   with   the   positive   charges   of the   orientated   dipoles   and   bind   the   diffusion   layer   of cations. Distribution   of the   @(.x) potential   in the   diffusion   part of the   double   layer   is described   by the   Poisson- Boltzman   equation.   The   potential   of the   surface   with the x,   coordinate   (slide   surface),   after   which,   at x >   X, the   ions   move   together   with   the   liquid   stream   U(X), is generally   called   the   < potential   (for   distilled   water, 0.005   G<<   0.064   V).

Taking   into   account   the   fact   that   the   liquid   electric resistance   is x/rrP,   where   X is the   specific   resistance,   the conduction   current   for an   accumulated   charge   Q is  (25)  For   the   process   of charging   and   simultaneous discharging   of a fragmentation   bubble   under formation, dQ   =   (I,--i,)dt   (26) Substitution   of (24)   and   (25)   into   (26)   followed   by integration,   yields:  Q   =   1   [l   -   exp(-Bt)]   (27) where When   specific   parameters   were   substituted   into   (27). we obtained   the   value   of the   charge   accumulated   on   the neck   of the   bubble   at the   instant   of its separation: Q -8   x   IO-‘*   C *O.In   considering   that   the   bubble separation   and   neck   collapse   occur   very   quickly.   one may   assume   that   the   uncompensated   charge   is concen- trated   locally   on   an   area   approximately   equal   to the neck   cross-section,   n?

To cause   an   electrical breakdown   in   dry   air   at atmospheric   pressure,   the critical   intensity,   E,,   =   3   X   lo6 V m-r,   is sufficient. Since   the   critical   intensity   originating   an   electrical breakdown   is proportional   to the   gas   pressure,   the electrical   discharge   in   the   cavitation   bubble   can   result. with   a high   probability,   even   at pressures   of up   to several   thousand   atmospheres.   When   this   happens.   the free pass   length   of a molecule   is much   less   than   the minimal   size   of a fragmentation   bubble.   or even   less than   a primary   cavitation   bubble.   Thus.   the   condition is fulfilled   for the   beginning   of an   avalanche   ionization during   the   breakdown. The   model   proposed   in   Ref. 80 of an   electric   charge localized   on   a cavitation   bubble   surface   and   the bubble’s   breakdown   permits   us to account   for the above   experimental   facts   which   are   difficult   to explain within   the   bounds   of the   thermal   theories.   Further- more.   a natural   explanation   is found   for the   origin   of such   phenomena   as electric   pulses   in   a liquid,   dis-  ULTRASONICS.   JULY   1985   167

Taking into   consideration   the   loss   of stability   of cavitation bubbles   during   hydrodynamic“’   and   IaseP   cavitation, we may   believe   that   the   role   of electrical   phenomena   in the   above   processes   is substantial. When   a cavitation   bubble   undergoes   an   electrical breakdown,   the   lines   of alkaline   and   alkaline-earth metals   in   strong   salt   solutions   should   appear, according   to the   proposed   model,   earlier   than   or concurrent   with   the   continuum   of sonoluminescence. In   accordance   with   the   thermal   mechanism   of cavita- tion   action.   results   obtained   with   the   cavitation- diffusion   modeP,   and   bubble   ‘collapse’   calculations (thermal   exchange   considered)63.   the   emission   of metal lines   should   result   after   the   continuum   radiation.   This fact   may   aid   the   choice   between   an   electrical   and   ;I  thermal   mechanism;   however.   to determine   the   phase of the   metal   line   emission   requires   extremely   high quality   equipment. In   conclusion.   it should   be noted   that   the   model   of the space-time   distribution   of radicals   (cavitation- diffusion)82,   when   applied   to the   electrical   breakdown of a bubble   by the   mechansim   of Ref. X0, undergoes only   insignificant   changes.   In   fact, the   plasma   bunch  resulting   from   the   breakdown   almost   instantly   nloves  to the   bubble   centre,   because   a microscopic   vapour cushion   is produced   near   the   region   of the   neck collapse.   For   this   case.   the   distribution   of temperature and   radicals   is appropriate   for description   by Gauss’s lati2.   The   distribution   of the   dissolved   substance remains   unchanged. The   basic   equations   of cavitation   bubble   dynamics correctly   describe   bubble   pulsations   at least   up   to bubble   sizes   close   to resonance   size   and   up   to their loss   of stability.   The   equations   allow   one   to calculate the   rate   of surface   charge   formation   caused   by quick renovation   of the   gas-liquid   interface   surface.   as well as many   parameters   of a splitting   cavitation   bubble.
