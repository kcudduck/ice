reactions In cavitation fields.
M.A. MARGULIS
Contemporary ideas on the nature of cavitation are reviewed in this paper. The
general theories of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions, the origin,
stability and splitting of cavitation bubbles, the dynamics of cavitation field
evolution, the peculiarities of cavitation effects at low intensity and low-
frequency acoustic oscillations, the sonoluminescence quenching effect and
some questions on the energetics of cavitation fields are discussed. The |
electrical theory of the splitting of cavitation bubbles may, as shown in the paper,

become an alternative to the thermal theories of cavitation in the future.
