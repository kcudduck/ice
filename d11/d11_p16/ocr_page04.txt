RR+ —R* =~ — Py — P(t) —4n= — = | | 1
where p,(R(t)) is the pressure inside the gas bubble, P(t) = FP, sin(wt) the driving acoustical
pressure with amplitude P, and frequency f = w/(27), Fy the ambient pressure, n the
dynamic viscosity, and o the surface tension. A historical review of the development of
this equation is given in ref. [12]. The typical RP bubble dynamics for increasing driving
pressure P, is shown in figure 2b.

The left-hand side of the RP equation (1) was already known to Lord Rayleigh who
derived it in the context of an analysis of cavitation damage of ship propellors |[1, 13, 14].
So already in Rayleigh’s time applied and fundamental science came hand in hand. The
solution to the inertial part RR + 2R* = 0 of the RP equation (1) is the power law

R(t)  (t, — 1)/5 2)
with a diverging singularity in the bubble wall velocity R(t) o (t, — t)~%/ at time t,. This
singularity reflects the violent bubble collapse which can occur for strong enough driving,
see figure 2. In a nutshell, at collapse, the gas inside the bubble gets compressed, heats up,
partly ionizes, and at recombination light is emitted [8, 15].

The work of Andrea Prosperetti also led us to the conditions under which stable single
bubble sonoluminescence can occur: An obvious necessary condition is the (spherical) shape
stability of the bubble, which Eller and Crum [16] had experimentally and Prosperetti
theoretically analysed [17]. We applied his results and determined under what conditions
the collapsing bubble would be (spherical) shape stable so that it would on the one hand
