FIG. 29. (a) Visualization of the different ways to numerically treat bubbles in TC flow, depending
on their sizes. Figure adopted from the PhD thesis of Vamsi Spandan, Physics of Fluids, University
of Twente, 2017. (b) Parameter space of bubble drag reduction in TC flow: Various bubble sizes
dy (given relative to the Kolmogorov scale 6,) were realized in experiments and simulations for
Reynolds numbers Re; from a few hundreds up to more than 10°. The left block of data are
experiments and numerical simulations for microbubble drag reduction from refs. [21/, 215, 222,
223], and the right block of data are our large Re experiments with deformable bubbles [196, 205,
206].
in the low Reynolds number regime the effect of bubble drag reduction gets smaller with
increasing Reynolds number (figure 28a).

As the relevant mechanism for bubble drag reduction in TC flow in the low Reynolds
number regime, we could identity the considerable weakening of the Taylor rolls through the
rising bubbles, see figures 28b-d. The crucial parameter in this low Reynolds number regime
is therefore the Froude number (and not the Weber number as in the large Reynolds number
regime), here defined as square root of the ratio between centrifugal force and buoyancy,
Fr = w;\/1;/g, where r; is the bubble radius, w; the angular velocity of the inner cylinder
and ¢ gravity. For small Fr < 1 (figure 28c), buoyancy wins, and the bubbles rise through
the Taylor rolls, thereby weakening them. This reduces the angular momentum transfer
from inner to outer cylinder and thus the drag. For large F'r > 1 (figure 28d) the bubbles
simply get trapped in the Taylor rolls, without affecting them much, and the overall drag
remains nearly unchanged [217]. For increasing Reynolds numbers the Taylor rolls more and
more lose their low dominance which explains why in this low Reynolds number regime the
bubble drag reduction decreases with increasing Reynolds number (figure 28a).

The challenge for the next years will be to close the gap between the microbubble drag
reduction experiments at lower Re of Murai et al. [214] and our large Re experiments
with deformable bubbles [196], see figure 29. Our first step on this way was to include
bubble deformability in point-particles by picking up an idea of refs. [218, 219] and couple
the deformation dynamics of ellipsoidal bubbles to the flow. Indeed, we found that bubble
deformation helped the overall drag reduction [217]. In a second step [220], we coupled the
well-resolved bubbles with an immersed boundary method to the Navier-Stokes equation,
again finding that an increase in the bubble deformability (i.e., its Weber number) indeed
