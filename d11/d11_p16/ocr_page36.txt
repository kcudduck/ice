FIG. 28. (a) Drag reduction DR as function of the Reynolds number Re; of the inner cylinder
in Taylor-Couette flow in the non-turbulent regime: The data are from the experiments by Murai
et al. [21], the numerical simulations of Sugiyama et al. [215], and the numerical simulations
by Spandan et al. [216]. One clearly sees that for these low Reynolds numbers the drag reduction
is decreasing with increasing Reynolds numbers. (b-d) Corresponding averaged azimuthal velocity
contours with point-bubbles included. Re; = 2500 and single phase flow is compared with two
different Froude numbers Fr = 0.16 (strong buoyancy, weakening the Taylor rolls considerable)
and Fr = 1.28 (weak buoyancy). In the latter case, the Taylor rolls are hardly affected by the
bubbles which get trapped in them. Figures taken from ref. [216].
207]. Also his later work with more bubbles confirmed this interpretation [212, 213].

For the numerical simulations of bubble drag reduction in TC flow, we started off mod-
erately, namely for relatively small Reynolds numbers (based on the inner cylinder rotation,
the outer cylinder was at rest) Re; < 5000, for which the flow is not yet turbulent. Note
that these Reynolds numbers are more than two orders of magnitude smaller than what I
discussed in figures 26 and 27. Interestingly enough, also in that low Re-regime Murai et al.
214] had experimentally found bubble drag reduction, namely by microbubble injection, see
figure 28a. But due to the lack of bubble deformability (We < 1 for the injected microbub-
bles), the physical mechanism in that regime must be very different. The good news is that
this regime is accessible to numerical simulations, and even with effective force models, as
the microbubbles can be considered as point-like, with We < 1 and a diameter d, < 10n,
where 7 is the (global) Kolmogorov length of the flow.

Our numerical simulations of bubbly TC flow at these low Re; < 5000 and with point-like
bubbles [215, 216] indeed resulted in bubble drag reduction in quantitative agreement with
Murai’s data [214], see figure 28a. In contrast to the bubble drag reduction in the large
Reynolds number regime, which increases with increasing Reynolds number (figure 26b),
