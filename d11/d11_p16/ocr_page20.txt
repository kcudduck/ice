namely on acoustical forces on a bubble and on rectified diffusion — was essential in solving
this problem.

Once the bubble has grown by rectified diffusion to considerable size, the actuation pres-
sure pulse to jet a droplet simply leads to bubble compression, and not to a pressure increase
at the nozzle. Therefore, no droplets can be jetted any longer. Only after the acoustic pres-
sure has been turned off, can the bubble dissolve by diffusion so that printing becomes
possible again.

The final goal of course must be to avoid the entrainment of the bubble or to immediately
get rid of it again, e.g., by applying an acoustical pulse immediately after the bubble has
been detected. For the next step — the development of even faster printers with even smaller
droplets — further fundamental work on the meniscus instability leading to the bubble en-
trainment remains essential.

FIG. 15. (a) Schematic cross section of an immersion lithographic scanning device. The water in
between the lens and the wafer reduces the imaging resolution below 40 nm. (b) Visualization of
the contact line instabilities: Bubbles are entrained at the advancing contact line whereas droplets
are lost at the receding contact line. (c) Entrained bubble volume after drop impact versus impact
velocity, given both in dimensional units (right and upper axis) and dimensionless units (left and
lower axis), showing a clear maximum. To the left capillarity prevails, while to the right inertia
prevails. Red circles correspond to experiments with color-interferometry, blue squares to boundary
integral simulations coupled to a viscous lubrication approximation. Figure adopted from ref. [97].

increasing velocity.

Bubble entrainment also turned out to be crucial for so-called immersion lithography, pi-
oneered by ASML, the world’s leading supplier of lithography systems for the semiconductor
industry. Once the photolithography of wafers had been at the edge of optical resolution,
even smaller structures were realized by introducing lithography machines using immersion
technology, i.e., lithography under a film of water (with a refractive index of 1.33, rather than
1.00 for air) between wafer and optical lens, see figure 15a, allowing for smaller structures on
