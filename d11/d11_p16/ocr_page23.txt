of curvature, tiny bubbles should dissolve immediately: In water the gas pressure inside a
bubble with R = 10 nm is pyes = Po + Praplace = 145 atm. With Henry's law this translates
to a gas concentration at the edge of the bubble cp = pyescs/ Fy which is 145 times larger
than the saturation concentration c, and therefore to a large concentration gradient away
from the bubble, leading to very fast dissolution. This even holds in the case of (slight) gas
oversaturation, i.e., as long as the gas oversaturation

is not too large. In the above mentioned classical paper by Epstein and Plesset [20], known
to us from our work on single bubble sonoluminescence, the dissolution time of such a
bubble had been calculated from the diffusion equation and the corresponding boundary
conditions. The result for the typical dissolution timescale is Tgp = Rip,/(2¢sD), where
D 1s the diffusion constant and p, the gas density. For the bubble with R = 10 nm and
the material constants for water, one indeed gets Tgp =~ 3 us, 1.e., such nanobubbles should
dissolve basically immediately.

FIG. 17. (a) AFM image (4 x 4pm?) of a surface nanobubble on a HOPG surface, obtained
through the solvent exchange process. (b) AFM image (30 x 30um?) of surface nanodroplets on a
hydrophobically coated Si surface, also obtained through the solvent exchange process. The color
code goes from 0 (red) to 800 nm (green). Figures taken from our recent review article on surface
nanobubbles and surface nanodroplets [121].

The surface nanobubbles in the AFM image figure 17a were generated with the so-called
solvent exchange process, which had been pioneered by Xuehua Zhang [122, 123]. Here, a
gas-saturated liquid having high gas solubility (e.g., ethanol) is replaced by another liquid
with lower gas solubility, e.g. with water. This leads to a local gas supersaturation ¢ > 0
and therefore to the nucleation of bubbles. Macroscopically, we know this effect of everyday
life: When we fill a water glass with cold tap water and leave it for a while in a warm room,
small air bubbles form on the inside of the glass. The reason is that in general tap water
is oversaturated with air and gases in cold water dissolve much better than in warm water.
If the tap water in the glass slowly warms up to room temperature, the gas solubility is
reduced and bubbles nucleate on the edge of the glass. Depending on the size of the glass,
the bubbles last about four days, as anyone can easily try.
