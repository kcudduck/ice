1. Acoustic and other forces on bubbles

2. Bubble dynamics and bubble shape stability

3. Diffusive bubble stability

4. Chemical bubble stability

5. Bubble nucleation

6. Bubble collapse and cavitation

7. Plasma formation and thermal bremsstrahlung

As we will see, all these items turned out to be very relevant in connection with various
applications — sometimes very unexpectedly. The insight obtained from single bubble sono-
luminescence therefore helped us enormously to discover and identify applied problems and
to help to solve them or at least make some progress on them. In the next chapters I will
report how this came about.

Namely, 1 will report on:

e¢ How our understanding of the bubble dynamics and of the bubble shape stability (sub-
ject 2 in above list) contributed to ultrasound diagnostics and to improve ultrasound
contrast agents. I will also report on other applications of bubble dynamics in the
medical context (section III).

e¢ How we found out that the sound of snapping shrimp originates from a cavitating
bubble (section IV, originating from subjects 5 and 6 in the above list).

e How the collapse of a bubble or a void close to a surface focuses the energy, leading
to a major jet (section V, originating from subject 6 in the above list).

e¢ How an entrained bubble in a piezo-acoustic inkjet channel can cause major trouble
due to rectified diffusion (subject 3 in the above list) and how to solve this problem
(section VT).

e How bubbles can nucleate on a microstructured surface and, when acoustically driven,
collapse in a controlled way, enhancing the efficiency of ultrasonic cleaning and chem-
ical reactions (section VII, originating from subjects 4, 5 and 6 in the above list).

e¢ How our understanding of diffusive bubble stability (subject 3 in the above list) was
instrumental to figure out why surface nanobubbles and surface nanodroplets are sta-
ble, with various applications in electrolysis, catalysis, diagnostics, and the food and
remediation industry (section VIII).

e Finally, how our understanding on bubble forces (subject 1 in above list) brought us
to bubbly two-phase flow, including studying drag reduction in turbulent bubbly flow,
for which bubble deformability (subject 2) is crucial (section IX).

The paper closes with conclusions and with a short outlook (section X). In particular, I
will motivate why from my point of view we live in the golden age of fluid dynamics. Both
wonderful bubble science and very relevant bubble applications are ahead of us.
