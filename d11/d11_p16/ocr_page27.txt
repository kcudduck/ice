processes with the outside world [140]. If the distance to the outside world is ¢, the typical
diffusive time scale is Toyser ~ £?/D. For £ = 1 cm we get Tourer = 14 hours and for £ = 3
cm Tuer ~ O days: This is exactly the time scale that we also observe for the dissolution
process of air bubbles which nucleate at the edge of the above mentioned glass filled with
cold, gas-supersaturated tap water when put into a warmer room.

FIG. 20. Time evolution of a surface nanobubble in MD simulations: (a) Without chemical
heterogeneities and gas-oversaturated liquid (¢ > 0) the bubble grows. (b) With hydrophobic chem-
ical heterogeneities and gas-undersaturated liquid (C < 0) the bubble shrinks. (c) With hydrophilic
chemical heterogeneities and gas-oversaturated liquid (( > 0) the pinning force for nanobubble stabi-
lization is not sufficient. (d) Only with hydrophobic chemical heterogeneities and gas-oversaturated
ligutd (C > 0) one does get a stable surface nanobubble. Figure taken from [139].

Just as single bubble sonoluminescence can be seen as the hydrogen atom of inertial
bubble dynamics [15], a single surface nanobubble can be seen as the hydrogen atom of
diffusive bubble dynamics. Its properties — in particular its on first sight surprising stability
and its small contact angle — are meanwhile reasonably well understood, see our review article
ref. [121]. As a next step, we have moved towards diffusively interacting surface nanobubbles.
Just as for inertial bubbles (section VII and figure 16b), one can best study also the diffusive
behavior of surface bubbles by fixing their distance by offering “weak spots” on a hydrophobic
surface, namely by micro-machining the surface: During the solvent exchange, the bubbles
will nucleate in the cavities and grow [141]. In fig. 21a we show snapshots of this growth
process over a period of three minutes. Note the very different timescale as compared to the
