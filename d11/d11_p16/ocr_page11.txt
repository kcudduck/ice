FIG. 6. (a) HeLa cells (some um in size) glued to a glass plate. In the center of the cell colony a
bubble imploded, leading to a cell detachment due to the induced shear flow. Cells at the edge took
up fluorescine, which is only possible through holes in the cell membrane. (b) These holes can be
visualized through electron microscopy. Figures taken from ref. [55].
vapor bubbles [58]. While for gas bubbles it makes sense to ascribe them an ambient radius
as the gas exchange processes with the environment are slow due to the slow gas diffusion,
it does not make sense for vapor bubbles, which are controlled by the much faster heat
diffusion and condensation and evaporation. Also the resonance frequency of vapor bubbles
does not scale like the inverse radius as for gas bubbles (equation (4)), but as ~ 1/R?/3
58]. Note that an expanding vapor bubble is not only invaded by evaporating liquid, but
also by gas dissolved in the liquid, which in the long term crucially determines its dynam-
ics and lifetime, as we showed for vapor bubbles generated with water-immersed plasmonic
nanoparticles [59].

Such so-called plasmonic microbubbles [60, 61] indeed also have potential biomedical
applications [62-66], again both in diagnosis and therapy (next to other potential appli-
cations in micro- and nano-manipulation, catalysis, and solar energy harvesting [67]), and
understanding and controlling the dynamics of these microbubbles is key to successfully
exploit them â€” and to recognize potential risks. In figure 7a we show the life-cycle of such
a plasmonic nanobubble, nucleating in air-saturated water thanks to laser-illumination of
plasmonic gold nanoparticles, each with a diameter of about 100 nm. Note the very differ-
ent timescales in between the four snapshots. After some delay time 7; after the beginning
of the illumination, the bubble explosively grows to giant size (as compared to the size of
the nanoparticle), up to a maximum radius of 80 um, and collapses again within ~ 10us
(bubble life phase 1, which we time-resolved with ultra high-speed imaging in figure 7b).
The maximum bubble volume V,,,,, remarkably increases with decreasing laser power IF, see
figure 7c, and, also remarkably, decreases with increasing gas saturation of the water.

We could explain [57] these remarkable features, based on the phase diagram of water (see
figure 7d for a sketch) and in particular the lines of attainable superheat therein, which are in
between the line of liquid-vapor coexistence and the liquid spinodal line. We first measured
the delay time 7; from the beginning of the illumination up to nucleation, which drastically
increases with decreasing laser power, leading to less total dumped energy FE = Py74. This
