the fuel consumed by ships without adding substances into water. As far as I can remember,
I myself first heard of this phenomenon at an APS DFD meeting in a talk of Kazu Sugiyama,
then a postdoc in the group of Yoichiro Matsumoto and Shu Takagi in Tokyo/Japan. For
excellent recent reviews on bubble drag reduction I refer to refs. [200-202].

Despite all efforts done to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind this effect,
a solid understanding of the drag reduction mechanisms occurring in bubbly flows has still
been missing. To achieve such an understanding, we wanted to study bubble drag reduction
under the well-defined conditions of turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow, the flow between
two coaxial co- or counter-rotating cylinders. For recent reviews on low-Reynolds number
and high-Reynolds number TC flow, we refer to ref. [203] and ref. [204], respectively. The
advantage of this canonical flow of physics of fluids is that it takes place in a closed system
and that both global measurements (the overall torque required to drive the system, i.e.,
the drag) and local measurements (by PIV or LDV) are possible. In a series of papers on
turbulent bubble drag reduction [196, 205, 206], we could indeed measure major bubble
drag reduction in this TC system, namely in the strongly turbulent case up to 40% with
only 4% volume fraction of the bubbles, see figure 26b, and in addition characterize bubble
concentration and velocity profiles. The measurements were consistent with the conjecture
that it is the bubble deformability that is responsible for the strong drag reduction, i.e, we
only found substantial drag reduction for bubble Weber numbers We larger than 1 [196].
These findings were in line with the results from numerical simulations by Gretar Tryg-
gvason’s group [207], employing the front-tracking technique. The modification of the lift
force on the bubbles due to their deformability (for We > 1) seems to play a central role in
the mechanism and the bubbles arrange themselves in between the turbulent bulk and the
boundary layers, blocking the momentum transfer and therefore reducing the overall drag.

How to further validate this hypothesis? If the hypothesis were correct, one should
change the bubble deformability during the experiment and then the drag should change on
the spot. But how to achieve this? In 2010 I had visited the group of Yoichiro Matsumoto
and Shu Takagi in Tokyo and saw their impressive huge bubble column experiment, in
which the addition of a few drops of surfactants (Triton X) immediately changed the flow
characteristics and bubble size, see ref. [208]; for a recent review of this phenomenon, see
209]. The main reason is that the Triton X surfactant prevents bubble coalescence, and that
therefore in strongly turbulent flow in which bubble splitting is omnipresent, the average
bubble size will dramatically decrease after the addition of Triton X.

We decided to apply the same trick in turbulent bubbly TC flow, and indeed found that
also here the addition of a few drops of Triton X (to 111 liter of water in our TC setup
210) dramatically changed the flow [211], see figure 27, in spite of the unchanged bubble
volume fraction: Optically (fig. 27a-f), because the flow became very opaque, just as in ref.
208], but in particular also mechanically (fig. 27g-h), as the effect of bubble drag reduction
nearly vanished. The combination of these local and global findings strongly supports the
hypothesis that it is the bubble deformability which is relevant for strong turbulent bubble
drag reduction.

How to numerically model turbulent bubble drag reduction? Given that the mechanism
is bubble deformability, which requires to resolve the gas-liquid interfaces of the bubbles and
given the large Reynolds numbers, this is extremely challenging. With the front-tracking
technique, Tryggvason and coworkers could simulate a few large bubbles in a “minimum
turbulent channel”, indeed qualitatively finding bubble drag reduction due to deformability
