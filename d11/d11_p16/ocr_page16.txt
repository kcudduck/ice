FIG. 10. (a) A disk (diameter 6 cm) is pulled through an air-water interface with constant velocity
of Im/s. The emerging void is collapsing due to the hydrostatic pressure. The photos are taken
88ms, 115ms, and 131ms after the impact of the disk, the solid line results from a boundary integral
calculation without any free parameter and shows excellent agreement with the data. The pictures
are taken from ref. [79]. (b) Here the pulled impact disk (diameter 4 cm) has a small azimuthal
asymmetry with a mode m=20 and an amplitude of 4%. Again, the impact velocity is 1 m/s. The
three snapshots show the evolution of the shape distortions. Taken from ref. [86].
FIG. 11. A comparable process as
in figure 10 at a later stage: Two
i jets have developed at the singular-
O ity: One upwards and one down-
wards into the bubble. This photo
is taken from ref. [1/].

The analogy between the 3D bubble collapse and the 2D void collapse goes so far that even
the shape stability can be analysed in one-to-one analogy, as again first done by Prosperetti
88]. Later, we extended this analysis both theoretically and experimentally to find the
shape of a collapsing non-axisymmetric impact-created air cavity in water [86], see figure
10b.

To proceed to even larger scale: How comparable is the impact of a ball on a water surface
with that of an asteriod on the surface of a planet? We downscaled such an astroid impact
to lab-scale by fluidizing very fine sand. Before the impact event, the air-flow is turned
off. The first reason for the fluidization is to create reproducible conditions. Second, the
fluidization implies that the energy stored in the ground decreases by orders of magnitude,
corresponding to the much smaller kinetic energy of the falling ball in the lab as compared
