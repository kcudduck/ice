forces acting on the bubble (a), the spiralling trajectories for certain parameters (b), and
the extracted rotational lift coefficients C';,, which remarkably can take both negative and
positive values (c¢) [169]. In a particularly counter-intuitive example, employing the Basset
history force as a non-local-in-time effective force [170], we could explain how viscosity can
destabilize the path dynamics of sonoluminescing bubbles [171], a phenomenon discovered
by Suslick and coworkers for sonoluminescing bubbles in glycol and called moving-SBL [172].
The unstable, chaotic path-trajectory of such a bubble is shown in figure 24d.

FIG. 24. (a) Forces acting on a bubble spiralling in a rotating horizontal cylinder: Drag Fp, lift Fr,
added mass Fx, and buoyancy Fg. The net force typically leads to a spiralling trajectory, as shown
in (b) for bubbles with two different sets of parameters (axes in mm; the center of the cylinder is
at (0,0). (c) Rotational lift coefficient Cro extracted from such trajectories (open symbols) and
compared with numerical data of ref. [170]. Figure (a) — (c) are taken from ref. [169], to which we
refer for more details. (d) y-position and three-dimensional trajectory of a moving SBSL-bubble in
N-methylformamide [172] from a dynamical model based on effective forces (including the history
force), for the same parameters as in experiment [172], where similar trajectories are observed.
Taken from ref. [171].

Encouraged by these successes, we |[175, 176] dared to transfer Maxey and Riley’s seminal
idea of using effective forces on small particles to describe their (collective) dynamics in
dispersed multiphase flow with point-like particles [173] to turbulent dispersed multiphase
flow [177-179] with point-like bubbles, following refs. [180-190|. The motion of the small
and thus non-deformable bubbles of radius a, volume V, = 4mwa’/3, velocity v(x,t) and
