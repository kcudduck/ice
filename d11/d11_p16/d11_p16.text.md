                       Contemporary ideas on the nature of cavitation are reviewed in this paper. The
                       general theories of sonoluminescence         and sonochemical   reactions, the origin,
                       stability and splitting of cavitation bubbles, the dynamics of cavitation field
                       evolution, the peculiarities of cavitation effects at low intensity and low-
                       frequency acoustic oscillations, the sonoluminescence         quenching effect and
                       some questions on the energetics of cavitation fields are discussed. The
                       electrical theory of the splitting of cavitation bubbles may, as shown in the paper,
                       become an alternative to the thermal theories of cavitation in the future.

were blue-white   discrete splashes. The spectra proved
to be rather flat and uniform (Fig. 7) and did not
contain either lines or bands (within the limits of the
resolution of the apparatus).                                                                  ffpwp ---     ...A.
