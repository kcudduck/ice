e Lewis number Le = k/D, ratio of thermal diffusivity x to mass diffusivity D, and thus
another material parameter,

e¢ Damkohler number Da, ratio between chemical reaction rate and (diffusive or convec-
tive) mass transport rate,

e Jakob number Ja = pc,(T — Tsqt)/(pu/\), ratio of sensible heat to latent heat. Here c,
is the liquid specific heat, A is the latent heat, p, the vapor density, T%,: the saturation
temperature of the liquid, and 7" the temperature of the surrounding liquid.

We will encounter most of these numbers in this article.

The selection of which bubble problems I will report on is naturally subjective and, as said
above, along my own scientific bubble journey. This will also be reflected in the citations,
where I will restrict myself to papers that had a significant scientific impact on me and
to references to our original work. Some of the given examples I briefly discussed before,
in a short Proceedings |3] (without Web of Science Index). There are many more bubble
problems and applications, which I cannot report here or which I am even not aware of, but 1
hope that the paper stimulates other scientists to look into the subject and be open towards
both fundamental and applied bubble problems, because — as I hope to be able to show with
this article — it is intellectually very rewarding, covers many areas of fluid dynamics, and
extremely relevant in many applications.

II. SONOLUMINESCENCE — ILLUMINATED BUBBLE DYNAMICS

The first major scientific bubble problem I bumped into was sonoluminescence. In 1994,
during my time as postdoc at the University of Chicago in the group of Leo Kadanoff, I
attended a lecture by Brad Barber on his PhD thesis on single bubble sonoluminescence
4, 5] (later summarized in [6]). This phenomenon had been discovered a few years earlier
by Felipe Gaitan |7, 8, then a PhD student in Mississippi, when he experimented with an air
bubble trapped in a water-filled flask by piezo-acoustical forces (the so-call Bjerknes force
9, 10], see figure 1 for a similar setup), which at the same time drive the bubble: When
the pressure is low, the bubble expands, and once it is high, it is compressed. But what
Galtan observed was first not believed by anybody: Under certain conditions the bubble
can emit light! How can this be? Typical acoustical energies are in the range of 10712 eV
per molecule, typical light energies in the range of 1 eV. This means that there is an energy
focusing factor of 101%! Sound, radius, and light intensity as function of time are reproduced
in figure 2a.

Directly after Barber's talk, I discussed this fascinating subject with my colleague Michael
Brenner, then also a postdoc at the University of Chicago. We asked ourselves the two
obvious questions: What is the light emitting process and under what conditions does this
phenomenon happen, i.e., what is the phase space of single bubble sonoluminescence? We
first focused on the second question, and started to read and learn about bubble dynamics.

We very soon found the seminal papers by Andrea Prosperetti on this subject, most visibly
summarized in his review [12]. The core dynamical equation is the celebrated Rayleigh-
