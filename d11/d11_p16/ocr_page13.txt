FIG. 8. (a) Sound emission of a snapping shrimp as function of time. (b) The frames show the
closing claw at the four times ty, to, ts, and ty indicated in (a): At ts the claw is closed, but there is
no sound. At ts the cavitation bubble has nucleated and grown. The bubble collapse at t4 coincides
with the maximum of the sound emission. The figure adopted from ref. [68].
IV. SNAPPING SHRIMP AND THE UNDERWATER SOUND OF BUBBLES

In another outreach effort, in 1999 I gave a colloquium talk on single bubble sonolumi-
nescene at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), also addressing the issue of sound
emission from the collapsing bubbles. After the talk, I met with a TUM zoologist who showed
me a signal of the sound emission of so-called snapping shrimp, and the same evening I met
these animals in the lab. They are about 5 cm long and live in the tropical ocean. With the
help of a huge claw they can make considerable noise. This animal is very unpopular with
the navy: First, it disturbs underwater communication between submarines. Second, even
worse, hostile submarines use shrimp colonies to “acoustically hide” themselves.

The first obvious question to ask is: How does the shrimp make such noise? Zoologists
thought that the sound pulse is caused by mechanical vibration on claw closure. Knowing
the sound emission of a collapsing bubble from the work on sonoluminescence, I had my
doubts on this hypothesis. Moreover, I knew the beautiful paper of Prosperetti, Crum, and
coworkers on the underwater noise of rain [69], in which it is shown, by correlating high-
speed imaging and sound detection with a hydrophone, that the noise arising when rain
drops fall on a water surface does not originate from the impact, but from the oscillations of
an entrained bubble. Following their example, we made high-speed movies of the snapping
event (the shrimp had to be tickled) and correlated them with the corresponding sound
track [68]. What we saw was that the shrimp closes its claw so quickly that a fast water
jet develops. High velocities imply low pressure. Just as in single bubble sonoluminescence
this leads to growth of bubbles. Once the pressure has equilibrated, the bubble collapses,
leading to sound emission (figure 8) at bubble collapse,
