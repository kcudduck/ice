detach. The condition L < L./( is the reason that there can be stable surface bubbles
only on a microscopic scale. The stabilization mechanism does not work on a macroscopic
scale, because then the Laplace pressure is too weak and cannot compensate for the gas
overpressure from the outside. We also see that on the microscopic scale, the radius of
curvature of a surface bubble is not given by Young's equation but by the relationship (8).
We note that eq. (8) and the stability of the equilibrium have also been confirmed both
by numerical simulations of the full diffusion equation [138], employing immersed boundary
methods for the growing or shrinking bubble, see figure 19, and in addition also by MD
simulations — but now with built-in pinning [139], see figure 20.

FIG. 19. Results from a numerical simulation (using the finite difference method) of the diffusion
equation, with the shrinking or growing pinned surface bubbles coupled with the immersed boundary
method: (a) Snapshots of the diffusive dynamics of a pinned surface nanobubbles growing towards
its equilibrium state. The color code represents the gas concentration field. Here L = 1 um and
¢ = 1. (b) Time evolution 68(t) of the contact angle growing or shrinking towards its equilibrium
value 6. given by Eq. (8). Two cases with different initial contact angles 6; are shown. Here, L = 1
um and = 1. (c¢) Equilibrium contact angle 0. for various gas concentrations (. The straight line
is the prediction eq. (8), giving perfect agreement. Again, L = 1 um. In the simulations here, the
domain size 1s 6umx3umx6um. Figures taken from ref. [138].

As we see, the size L of the pinning site and the oversaturation ( > 0 determine the
stability of the surface nanobubbles. But how is the oversaturation ( determined? When the
liquid container with the surface nanobubbles on some substrate is closed and in equilibrium,
( remains constant and hence the equilibrium contact angle 6., Eq. (8). In an open vessel,
on the other hand, an initial gas oversaturation ¢ > 0 will not last long due to diffusive
