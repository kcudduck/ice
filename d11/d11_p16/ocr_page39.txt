interaction between experiment, theory, and numerics is crucial in physics of fluids and
in particular in physics of bubbles, and makes this subject so particularly nice. Only a
combination of all three methods gives real insight into the phenomena.

I also hope to have demonstrated with the chosen examples how crucial and essential
for innovation of any kind fundamental research is. In what direction creative fundamental
research will go is often unpredictable. If one ends up exactly where one had expected, the
chance is large that the research was standard. What remains crucial is to be open, watch,
and listen.

I want to close with some more general comments on fluid dynamics: From my point of
view we presently live in the golden age of fluid dynamics: The reasons are that (i) Moore’s
law is kept on still being followed for the computational power, now making simulations
possible of which even ten years ago we did not dare to dream of, and (ii) a similar rev-
olution (for the same reason) in digital high-speed imaging, now being able to routinely
resolve the millisecond time scale and even smaller time scales [224], revealing new physics
on these scales which up to now was inaccessible and producing a huge amount of data
on the flow. Also other advanced equipment like confocal microscopy, digital holographic
microscopy and atomic force microscopy get more and more used in fluid dynamics. With
all of these advances together, the gap between what can be measured and what can be
ab-initio simulated is more quickly closing than we had anticipated at the end of the last
century.

Also other gaps are closing: Fluid dynamics and in particular that of bubble fluid dy-
namics 1s bridging out to various neighboring disciplines such as chemistry and in particular
colloidal science, catalysis, electrolysis, medicine, biology, computational science, and many
others. Here the techniques, approaches and traditions from fluid dynamics can offer a lot
to help to solve outstanding problems — vice versa, these fields can offer wonderful questions
to fluid dynamics. Academic (bubble) fluid dynamics is also bridging out not only to tra-
ditional applications on large scales such as in chemical engineering, in the food industry,
or in geophysics, but also to various new high-tech applications, be it in inkjet printing,
immersion and XUV lithography, chemical diagnostics, and lab-on-a-chip microfluidics.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Science 1s a collective activity. The scientific insight in this paper is gained during my
bubble journey over more than two decades together with my colleagues, postdocs, PhD
students, and students and I would like to thank them for all their work and contributions,
and for the stimulation and intellectual pleasure we have enjoyed when doing physics. But
first of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my scientific teacher, Professor
Siegfried Grossmann, for all what I learnt from him, which goes way beyond physics. Then,
in particular, on this subject of bubbles, I would like to thank Michael Brenner, Sascha
Hilgenfeldt and Michel Versluis, with whom my bubbly journey started, and the “part-time
professors” of our Twente Physics of Fluids group, namely my colleagues and friends Andrea
Prosperetti (who also inspired us on the beauty of bubbles in art [225]!), Roberto Verzicco,
Chao Sun, and Xuehua Zhang, whose intellectual contribution to our group is way beyond
“part-time”, from whom I learned tremendously, and with whom it has been a great pleasure
and privilege to work.

I also gratefully acknowledge generous financial support over the years, mainly from NWO
