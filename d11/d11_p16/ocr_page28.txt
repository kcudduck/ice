FIG. 21. (a) Controlled microbubble formation and growth on hydrophobic surfaces decorated with
maicro-machined micropits (with diameter of 10 um and edge-to-edge distance of 13 um) by solvent
exchange: The microchannel was first filled with air-saturated water which was then replaced by
ethanol solution under a flow rates of 100 uL/min. Figure taken from ref. [145]. (b) Dissolution
process of an ensembles of HDODA nanodroplets with a typical contact diameter of L = 10—30um.

The color scale corresponds to a height of Oum (blue) to 0.9um (red) of the droplets. The dissolution

process was stopped by polymerisation of the HDODA by UV-radiation, so that a visualization of
the droplets by AFM became possible, a trick introduced in ref. [146]. Figure taken from [147].

For interacting surface nanobubbles, according to above sketched theory [134] one would
expect that in equilibrium all surface nanobubbles would have the same radius of curvature
R. = L./(2(). On first sight, one may expect that this equilibrium is unstable due to
Ostwald ripening of the bubbles [142]: Small bubbles shrink due to their larger Laplace
pressure and neighboring larger ones grow. However, it turns out that again it is pinning
which stabilizes these neighboring bubbles against Ostwald ripening [143, 144].

As stated above, a central idea of solving the surface nanobubble paradox originated from
the analogy to the pinned coffee stain [136]: The first problem is controlled by diffusion of
air in liquid, the latter one by diffusion of vapor in air. In between these two cases is the one
of a liquid surface nanodroplet (see figure 17b) in a sparsely miscible host liquid, for which
the stability (with pinning, or lack thereof, without pinning) is given by the same equations
and mechanisms [121].

Not only the dissolution processes of such surface nanodroplets (see figure 21b) are com-
pletely analogous to those of surface nanobubbles, but also the nucleation and growth pro-
cesses. In particular, it is again the solvent-exchange process that allows surface nanodroplets
to be generated in a controlled manner [146, 148]: Now a high solubility liquid saturated with
a certain substance is replaced by another with less solubility. The emerging oversaturation
leads to droplet nucleation.

As an example, consider the Greek liquor “Ouzo” (alternatively Pastis (France) or Sam-
