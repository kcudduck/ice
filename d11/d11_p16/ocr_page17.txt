FIG. 12. (a-f) Impact (at t=0 s) of a steel ball (diameter 2.5 cm) on soft, decompactified sand
(grain diameter typically 40 um). The splash and the jet emerge, just as in water. The grains in
the jet cluster due to their inelastic collisions. The last frame shows a granular eruption caused by
the rising air bubble. (gq) A cross section of the void collapse following from the axially symmetric
Rayleigh-type model of ref. [76]: The void is pressed together by the hydrostatic pressure from the
side, leading to a singularity and an upward and downward jet. Both series of images are taken
from ref. [76].
to that of an impacting astroid. The idea is to achieve similar Froude numbers and Newton
numbers (the ratio between yield stress of the surface and kinetic energy of the intruder) as
in the geophysical event, hoping for similar dynamical behavior.

Indeed, the phenomena of the impact of a ball on such prepared sand turned out to be
very comparable to those of the impact on water [76]: First a splash is formed and then
a jet develops (figure 12), just as in the water case (figure 11). Even the bubble, which
forms in water, again develops and slowly rises, finally, when hitting the sand-air interface,
causing a granular eruption. It however also turned out that the air in between the sand
grains has a major role in the emergence and intensity of the jet [89-91], namely, when prior
to the impact event (partially) evacuating the air from the container with the sand, the jet
is much less pronounced as the impacting object can intrude less deep, leading to a weaker
“hydrostatic” collapse. An excellent review on impact of objects on granular beds can be
found in ref. [92].

Science in the university and science in industry often have a difficult time finding each
other. In an effort to facilitate the contact, in 2001 the Dutch science foundation organized
a get-into-contact event, where I met Hans Reinten from Océ, at the time an independent
Dutch company, and since 2010 a member of the Canon Group. Today, Océ is the leading
developer of high-end production printing systems for commercial printing. Océ has been
