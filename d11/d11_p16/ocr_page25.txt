FIG. 18. (a) The nanobubbles can dissolve in two different “modes” (the time direction is indicated
by the arrow): In the CA mode (constant contact angle, above), the contact angle is constant. As
a result, the radius of curvature becomes smaller and smaller, which leads to the divergence in the
Laplace pressure, as can be seen in (b) (red curve), where we show Ap = Drapiace aS a function
of the bubble volume V. In the CR mode (constant contact radius, bottom), the contact radius is
constant and the contact angle becomes smaller. As a result, the radius of curvature increases in
the course of the dissolution process and the divergence in Laplace pressure does not occur (blue
curve in (b)). In (c), we show a sketch of the phase space for the stable equilibrium, which results
in “pinning” (CR-mode, bottom), with the equilibrium contact angle 0., given by equation (§8)),
and a sketch of the phase space for unstable equilibrium without pinning (CA-mode), in which the
surface bubble either shrinks or grows. In (d) the used notation is introduced: L is the lateral extent
of the bubble at the substrate (contact diameter), H is the bubble height, 0 is the contact angle at
the gas side, and R the radius of curvature.
can exist. That the equilibrium indeed is stable is seen from the phase space figure 18c,
bottom. In this stable equilibrium, Laplace pressure (causing gas flux out of the bubble)
and gas overpressure (causing gas influx) are in balance.
From equations (7) and (8) we also see that for too large oversaturation ( > L./L there
is no stable equilibrium and the surface bubble keeps on growing so that it will finally
