FIG. 26. (a) Sketch of the envisioned bubble drag reduction for naval transportation (Mitsubishi
corporation, Japan): Bubbles are injected under the ship hull. (b) Drag reduction as function of
bubble volume concentration in turbulent bubbly Taylor-Couette flow for three different Reynolds
numbers of the rotating inner cylinder, namely Re = 0.5-10° (red data), Re = 1.0-10° (blue data),
and Re = 2.0 - 10% (yellow data). The vertical axis shows the required torque with bubbles divided
by the required torque in the single flow case. Figure taken from ref. [196].

FIG. 27. (a-f) Snapshots of bubbly Taylor-Couette turbulence (a = 1%, Re; = 2 - 10°) with
increasing magnification (as shown by the scale bars). In the first row no surfactants (a-c) are
present in the turbulent flow, whereas the second row (d-f) shows the (statistically stationary)
situation after addition of 6 ppm Triton X-100. In the left photos the Twente Turbulent Taylor-
Couette (T° C) apparatus [210] can be seen. (g) Friction coefficient cs as function of time for various
bubble volume concentrations a. The surfactant is added at time t = 0 s. (h) Corresponding drag
reduction DR (in %) as function of time. The inset shows how the drag reduction depends on the
bubble volume concentrations: open circles: without surfactant; stars: with surfactant. Figures
taken from ref. [211].
