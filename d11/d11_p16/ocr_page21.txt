the wafer than standard lithography in air. However, the development of immersion lithog-
raphy machines has been hindered by two fundamental fluid dynamical problems, namely,
the entrainment of bubbles into the water and the loss of water from the film, see fig. 15b.
Both of these contact line instabilities have challenged the further development of immer-
sion lithography, as obviously the entrainment of light-scattering bubbles into the film or
the partial loss of the film is unacceptable for the lithography process. These hydrodynamic
instabilities set in at a certain velocity with which the wafers under the lens are pulled away.
It 1s thus this hydrodynamic instability which sets the production rate of the wafers and
therefore the price of the lithographic system.

In the context of this problem, together with ASML we looked at the entrainment of
bubbles under droplets impacting on a solid substrate, following pioneering work of the
Chicago, Harvard, Kaust and other groups [98-103] (for recent reviews, see refs. |104, 105]).
By combining high-speed color interferometry [106], scaling arguments, and numerical sim-
ulations with the boundary integral method for the droplet coupled to a viscous lubrication
approximation for the gas flow in the thin and narrowing gap between impacting droplet and
substrate, we found that there is an optimal velocity for maximal bubble entrainment [97]:
For lower velocities the impacting droplet remains more spherical (capillary regime) and for
higher velocity (inertial regime) the drop is smashed against the surface so much that not
much air can be entrained, either, see fig. 15c. Obviously, this work is also of interest for
the inkjet industry and the coating industry.

VII. FROM SURFACE BUBBLES TO SONOCHEMISTRY & ULTRASONIC

CLEANING

As stated above, single bubble sonoluminescence can be seen as the hydrogen atom of
bubble fluid dynamics. But atomic physics did not stop with the understanding of the
hydrogen atom but moved ahead to more complicated and interacting atoms, molecules,
and condensed matter. So it was also our desire to better understand interacting bubbles,
but in the most controlled way, with fixed distance. To achieve this acoustically is difficult,
as acoustically driven microbubbles either repel or attract each other through the so-called
Bjerknes forces of the second kind [1, 109], depending on their size and the driving pressure.
If trapped by the primary Bjerknes forces in different pressure antinodes of the acoustic
field, they are too far away (7.5 cm corresponding to the acoustic wavelength for f = 20
kHz in water) from each other to considerably interact. Therefore we came up with the
idea to trap the bubbles through pinning forces to hydrophobic micro-machined micro-
cavities which act as gas traps when the substrate is immersed in water [107, 110], see figure
16a,b. The patterning of the substrate allows us to control the number of bubbles and the
distance between them. Each hemispherical bubble experiences the effect of its mirror image.
Correspondingly, an isolated hemispherical bubble together with its mirror image behaves
like a free spherical bubble, i.e., its dynamics is well described by the Rayleigh-Plesset
equation (1). By putting the micro-cavities close to each other, we could study interacting
microbubbles, either in a row (i.e., in 1D) as in figure 16b, where we could compare the
results with boundary integral simulations (i.e., under the potential flow approximation)
with axial symmetry, or in 2D with bubbles arranged on a surface in any order.

In fact, by varying the diameter of the microhole down to 100 nm and less, we could quan-
titatively test [108] the crevice model of bubble nucleation [111-114]. Figure 16cÂ¢ compares
