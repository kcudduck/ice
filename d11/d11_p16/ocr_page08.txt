III. ULTRASOUND DIAGNOSTICS, ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS,
AND OTHER APPLICATIONS OF BUBBLES IN DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPY,
AND MEDICINE

In an outreach effort, in order to popularize physics, fluid dynamics, and bubbles, in
1995 I had written an article on single bubble sonoluminescence in “Physikalische Blatter”,
which was the German analog of Physics Today. Based on this, I got contacted by a
physicist working for a pharmaceutical company on ultrasound contrast agents (UCA), which
are Introduced into the blood to enhance the acoustic scattering and which contain small,
encapsulated microbubbles. These very effectively scatter ultrasound, see fig. 4a. In this
way, 1t 1s e.g. possible to visualize the perfusion of tissue, like the heart muscle. The images
are meanwhile used to obtain diagnostic information from the volume, shape and movement
of the heart ventricles, in studying the blood flow in small blood vessels, in blood perfusion
measurements, and in targeted molecular imaging, among others [33-35].

FIG. 4. (a) Ultrasound image of a heart without (left) and with (right) previous injection of
micro-bubbles. In the second case the structures become clearer as the bubbles act as ultrasound
contrast enhancers. (b) Electron micrograph of a microbubble coated with a protein layer, taken
from ref. [36]. (c) Figen frequency fo of a sound-driven coated with DPPC monolayers as function
of the ambient bubble radius (blue data points, from [37]). The solid blue line shows the fit to the
Marmottant model [38], whereas the dashed line shows the Minnaert frequency (3). Figure adopted
from ref. [39]. (d) With the coating the sound-driven bubbles show the typical “compression only”
behavior, with the compression being much more pronounced than the expansion. Figure taken from
ref. [38].

One of the nagging questions in ultrasound diagnostics in the mid 1990s was: How does
