FIG. 14. (a) Acoustic response (as reflected in the piezo-current) of a normally operating nozzle
(blue line) and with an entrained air bubble with a volume of Vi, = 80pl (red) close to the nozzle
plate. It can be seen that the volume oscillations of the entrapped bubble modify the piezo-current
significantly: the piezo-current amplitude is less damped and the main frequency decreases. (b)
Comparing optically and acoustically measured bubble volume during bubble dissolution (which takes
about 250 s here): The acoustically measured bubble volume is shown as red dotted line and the
optically measured bubble volume as blue solid line. The areas around the lines give the error
margins in the results. Figures taken from ref. [94].

Hans Reinten then told me that unfortunately this very fast and precise printing facility
can break down from time to time: After billions of cycles a distortion of the droplet
formation in a channel can develop. This distortion either vanishes after a short time (figure
13b), or the jetting process of that channel eventually completely breaks down. The only
solution then is to turn off the piezo and wait for a minute or so, which of course is extremely
annoying for a high-speed printer (though other nozzles might take over during that time).
The suspected culprit for the problem was a bubble within the inkjet channel. But how does
the bubble get there and what is its dynamics? And how to avoid this trouble?

To solve this problem, we employed the same method as for the snapping shrimp [68]
or the entrained bubble at water droplet impact [69]: watch and listen. I.e., we measured
the acoustic response of the channel and combined it with high-speed imaging. Indeed, we
found that the distortion of the droplet is correlated with a modification of the acoustic
response of the channel. This result indeed suggested that the distortion originates from a
bubble, because bubbles modify the acoustical behavior of the channel [94, 95]. In fact, we
were even able to “hear” the size of the bubble, see figure 14. But how does the bubble get
there? Is it nucleated or entrained at the nozzle?”

By combining high-speed imaging for the inkjet and infrared imaging for the interior of
the ink-channel, we succeeded to visualize how a bubble is entrained at the nozzle [93, 96
and what are its dynamics inside the channel (figure 13c). Here small dirt particles —
either on the nozzle plate or in the ink channel — play a crucial role. Once a tiny bubble
is entrained at the nozzle, the acoustical forces pull it into the channel. Just as in single
bubble sonoluminescence, the oscillating bubble then grows in the acoustic field by rectified
diffusion. So the knowledge which we had acquired from single bubble sonoluminesence —
