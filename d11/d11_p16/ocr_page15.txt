integral methods, in the context of fluid dynamics again pioneered by Andrea Prosperetti
72]. With such methods one can optimize the sound emission in the low frequency range.
This 1s not restricted to single bubbles, but one can also analyse bubble clusters and their
collective sound emission, either in 2D by employing some symmetry, or fully 3D. Presently,
together with the oil company Shell, who contacted us on this problem, we are pursuing
such calculations.

V. IMPACT ON LIQUIDS AND ON “SOFT” SAND

We had started to work with boundary integral methods in the context of impact events.
What had triggered us was again the above mentioned pioneering paper by Prosperetti,
Crum and coworkers on rain drops falling on the ocean [69, 72], leading to bubble entrainment
and sound emission. Apart from the question on sound emission, another important question
to ask 1s: How much air ends up in the water? The answer is relevant, for example, in climate
models, in which models for the atmosphere are coupled to those of the ocean. To answer
this question, Prosperetti and coworkers had employed boundary integral methods [72-74],
finding very good agreement with the experimental results.

In the late 1990s and in the first two decades of this century, the development of digital
high-speed cameras has boomed, ever increasing in frame-rate, resolution, and storage, and
lowering in price considerably. That gave us the opportunity to look into the impact events
and the subsequent void collapse in more detail. This line of research was also triggered by
single bubble sonoluminescence, namely to analyze in detail the hydrodynamic singularity
at collapse; here not the spherically symmetry bubble collapse, but the axially symmetric
void collapse. In fact, mathematically the collapse of the void formed after impact can
approximately be described by a two-dimensional Rayleigh equation [75-79] analog to the
3D Rayleigh equation (1), which has been so successful in describing the collapse of the
sonoluminescing bubble. The 2D version of the inertial part of the Rayleigh equation reads
RR + R? = 0, with the singularity solution R(t) x (t;, — t)'/2. However, the collapse of a
void emerging at impact is not purely 2D and correction terms emerge. Indeed, experimental
studies have found that the exponent of the power law is higher than 1/2 (typical values
found are 0.54 — 0.60) [77-82] and theoretical studies have shown that the exponent indeed
has a weak dependence on the logarithm of the remaining collapse time, approximating to
1/2 only asymptotically at the end [83-85].

To analyze these questions in a controlled way, rather than letting droplets or spheres fall
on a water surface, we pulled a disk with controlled velocity V (defining the Froude number
Fr = V?/(gRgs,) as dimensionless control parameter) through the air-water interface and
performed high-speed imaging of the void collapse and jet formation [79, 82, 85]. Figure 10a
shows how the cavity develops and then collapses due to the hydrostatic pressure from the
side. At singularity two jets emerge (figure 11): one upwards straight into the air, the other
downwards into the developing bubble. Just as in 3D the focusing power of the collapsing
(sonoluminescing) bubble is converted into sound and light emission (and of course heat),
in 2D this focusing power is converted into the jet formation. As one can see from figure
10a, excellent agreement between experiments and the boundary integral simulations can
be achieved. Even the effect of the air flow can be included [87], which reverses during the
collapse from downwards during void formation to upwards during void collapse, leading to
a supersonic air flow out of the closing void.
