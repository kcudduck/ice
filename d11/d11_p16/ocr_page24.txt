First it was speculated that the stability of surface nanobubbles is due to surfactants [124],
which however for various reasons (explained in ref. [121]) could be ruled out. Moreover,
with the help of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy it could be shown [125], that the
objects observed with AFM are indeed air bubbles, and not nanodroplets of a contaminating
liquid. In addition to the remarkable stability of the nanobubbles, another paradox was that
their contact angle (measured on the bubble side) was not Young's angle, as known from
macroscopic measurements, but much smaller [126, 127].

When there is such a large gap between experiment and theory, numerical simulations of-
ten help. We therefore performed MD (molecular-dynamics) simulations of surface nanobub-
bles [128], and at least those adhered to the theoretical expectation: they dissolved in mi-
croseconds.

The key to solving this paradox came from the experiments of Xuehua Zhang and
coworkers [129] who observed that surface nanobubbles exposed to gas-undersaturated water
(¢ < 0) dissolve slowly, but (initially) not by reducing their lateral size, but by reducing their
contact angle (on the gas side), see Fig. 18a: The three-phase contact line remains pinned.
This dissolution mode is called “CR-mode”, standing for constant contact radius, in con-
trast to the so-called “CA-mode”, standing for constant contact angle [130, 131]. Pinning
dramatically changes the dissolution scenario: the Laplace pressure prgpiace = 20/R now no
longer diverges, but approaches zero, see Figure 18b. Thus, when the bubble dissolves, no
large internal pressure can build up and thus no concentration gradient from the outside
of the bubble to the predetermined concentration level c,, far away from the bubble: The
bubble becomes stable.

The reason for the pinning lies in the unavoidable surface inhomogeneities of geometric
and/or chemical nature. These are also relevant in the above mentioned daily life phe-
nomenon of bubble formation in a glass with cold tap water which warms up or when we
pour soda water into a glass: In both cases bubbles nucleate out of oversaturated water
on such inhomogeneities. Macroscopically, the surface inhomogeneities lead to contact line
hysteresis, as studied extensively by de Gennes and co-workers in the 1990s [132, 133].

We could generalize the classical Epstein-Plesset calculation [20] to calculate the diffusive
dynamics of pinned surface bubbles [134]. Here the key idea was to adopt the quasistatic
calculation of Popov [135] for the so-called “coffee stain problem” [136, 137], which is on
the evaporation of a liquid drop on a plain substrate. This is not surprising, because both
processes are controlled by diffusion outside of the drop / bubble: in the evaporating droplet
case, of diffusion of water vapor in air, and in the surface nanobubble case, of air into water.
For bubbles with constant contact diameter L (i.e., in the CR-mode), the result of this
adopted (quasistatic) calculation reads [134]

with a positive definite f(6) given in ref. [135] and a critical lateral extension L, = 40/ Fy ~
2.84m for air bubbles in water with 1 atm ambient pressure. From eq. (7) it immediately
follows that for gas undersaturation —1 < ¢ < 0 no stable surface nanobubbles can exist, as
then the right-hand side of eq. (7) is always negative: the bubble dissolves down to 8 = 0.
For gas oversaturation ¢( > 0, however, a stable equilibrium with the equilibrium contact
