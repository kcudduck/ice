FIG. 7. (a) Time sequence of a plasmonic bubble (generated at gold nanoparticles) under continuous
laser irradiation in gas-rich water. The nucleation and growth dynamics of the plasmonic bubbles
as four phases (see text). The scale bar is 25 um. (b) Evolution of the initial giant plasmonic
bubble during its life cycles in an air-saturated liquid, captured at 7.47 million frames per second.
The laser power was Py = 185mW. (c¢) Maximum volume Vy,q. of the giant bubble as function
of laser power Pp in gas-rich water and gas-poor water. (d) Schematic phase diagram of water.
The green solid line is the liquid spinodal line, the theoretical limit of superheat, while the blue and
red dashed lines schematically depict the attainable superheat for gas-poor and gas-rich water. (e)
Maximal volume of the giant bubble Vi. as function of the dumped energy E = Py14 in gas-rich
and gas-poor water. Both cases show the identical linear relation, regardless of the delay time 74
and the applied laser power Py. All figures taken from ref. [57].
dumped energy E shows a universal linear scaling relation with V,,,,., irrespectively of the gas
concentration of the surrounding water (figure 7e). This finding supports the interpretation
that the initial giant bubble is a pure vapor bubble. In contrast, the delay time does depend
on the gas concentration of the water, as gas pockets in the water facilitate an earlier
vapor bubble nucleation, which leads to smaller delay times and lower bubble nucleation
temperatures (see again the phase diagram of water, figure 7d). After the collapse of the
initial giant bubbles, first much smaller oscillating bubbles form out of the remaining gas
nuclei (bubble life phase 2, up to typically 10 ms, see fig. 7a). Subsequently, a vaporization-
dominated growth phase takes over and the bubble stabilizes (life phase 3). In the final life
phase 4, the bubble slowly grows by gas being expelled due to heating of the surrounding.
