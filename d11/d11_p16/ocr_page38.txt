FIG. 30. (a) Drag reduction in turbulent TC flow as function of Weber number for two differ-
ent Reynolds numbers: Increasing Weber number implies increasing bubble deformability which is
crucial for the drag reduction. Taken from the numerical simulations of ref. [220]. (b,c) Numer-
ical simulations showing plume detachment from the inner TC cylinder for single phase flow (b)
and bubbly flow (c), where the momentum transfer is considerably depressed. In the latter case
deformable bubbles considerably lower the momentum transfer. The calculation was done with the
immersed boundary method.
implies larger drag reduction, see figure 30a. Profiles of the local angular velocity flux
show that, in the presence of bubbles, turbulence is enhanced near the inner cylinder while
attenuated in the bulk and near the outer cylinder. We connect the increase in drag reduction
to the decrease in dissipation in the wake of highly deformed bubbles near the inner cylinder
220], as visualized in figure 30b,c. As in the closed TC system the total dissipation is
proportional to the total torque [204], the decrease in dissipation implies a decrease in the
overall drag.

Bringing all these fundamental insights into bubble drag reduction towards applications in
naval industry however still is a very long way to go and other concepts like air cavities may
be more efficient [221]. We are presently collaborating with the Dutch Maritime Research
Institute (MARIN) in Wageningen on this subject.

X. CONCLUSIONS

I hope to have demonstrated — along my own bubble trajectory — how fascinating and
broad the fluid dynamics of a bubble is, from the nanometer scale to geophysical scales,
with both outstanding fundamental questions and relevant applications. Clearly, the close
