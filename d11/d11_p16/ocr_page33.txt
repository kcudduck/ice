Here, ps is the liquid density and p, < ps is the (low) gas density. The terms on the
right-hand side of eq. (9) represent buoyancy, drag, added mass plus fluid acceleration, and
lift, where Cp, Cs and Cf, are the corresponding coeflicients, which are modelled. Though
in such complicated turbulent flow situation in particular the lift coefficient is not exactly
known, as an approximation — and in order to explore the effect of the lift force on the overall
flow dynamics — we took the standard value Cp, = 1/2 [166] for small spherical bubbles in
shear flow. Following this approach, we studied the effect of the bubbles on the turbulent
energy spectra [176], the Lagrangian statistics of bubbles in turbulence [191] finding very
pronounced intermittency of the bubble acceleration, and the clustering of bubbles in the
vortices [174, 192], see figure 25, in which we compare the distribution of bubbles with that
of particles in dispersed multiphase flow. We also extended the effective bubble force idea
to vapor bubbles in turbulent flow which can shrink and grow thanks to evaporation and
condensation [193-195]. In this way we could reveal the physics of the considerable enhanced
heat transfer in boiling thermal convection as compared to normal thermal convection.
Two enhancing effects compete: Enhancement due to additional mixing by the rising vapor
bubbles, and enhancement due to the bubbles as directed carriers of (latent) heat from
the boiling bottom plate to the cold top plate. Due to the many modelling assumptions a
quantitative comparison with experimental data [117] however remains difficult.

One of the most remarkable features of dispersed bubbly flow is that a bubble addition
of only a few percent leads to remarkable drag reduction of up to 80% [197, 198], with great
potential for naval applications [199] (see figure 26a), as it can lead to significant reduction of
