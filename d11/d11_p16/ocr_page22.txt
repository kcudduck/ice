FIG. 16. (a) Electron microscopy image of an individual hydrophobic microcavity (diamter 4pm)
etched on a silicon plate acting as gas trap. Taken from ref. [107]. (b) Comparison between
experiment and boundary integral simulation of the cavitation of 5 bubbles in microholes set on a
line with a distance of d = 200 um and a driving pressure of P, = —1.4 MPa. One clearly sees
the shielding effect for the inner bubble, collapsing later than the outer ones. Figure taken from
ref. [107]. (c) Nucleation threshold p,, as function of the pit radius r. for both theory (line) and
experiment (symbols, crosses: nucleation, circles: no nucleation). The inset shows a zoom in with
error bars. For visibility overlapping points are shifted £0.25 nm with respect to each other. Figure
taken from [108].
the nucleation threshold calculated from the crevice model [114] with the experimental data,
finding good agreement. We also used such hydrophobic micro-machined pits as artificial
crevices for bubble nucleation to achieve higher sonochemical yields at ultrasound powers
that would otherwise not produce a significant chemical effect [115] and for ultrasonic clean-
ing purposes [116], in both cases making use of the energy focusing power of the collapsing
bubbles. Out of this activity another spin-off company emerged from our group. Finally,
with such pits we enhanced the heat flux in thermal convection by vapor-bubble nucleation

VIII. FROM SURFACE NANOBUBBLES TO CATALYSIS AND
ELECTROLYSIS
Being interested in tiny surface bubbles, the so-called surface nanobubbles caught my
attention, which from about 2000 on have been found in atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images of water-immersed, preferentially hydrophobic substrates [118-120], see figure 17a.
One of course immediately wonders why such surface nanobubbles are stable. Because of the
diverging Laplace pressure prapiace = 20/ R, where o is the surface tension and R the radius
