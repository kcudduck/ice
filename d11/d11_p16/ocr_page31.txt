FIG. 23. Snapshots of the coalescence of two diffusively grown gas bubbles pinned to 50 um radius
pits. When they touch and coalesce, both bubbles have a diameter of 600 um. Three main stages
can be identified: neck formation between the two bubbles, images (a-d); propagation of the capillary
waves along the upper and lower half-surface of the coalescing bubble and their final convergence
at its side, images (e-l1); and final detachment, upwards jumping, rising and oscillation with the
Minnaert frequency, images (m-o). Adopted from ref. [165].

IX. EFFECTIVE BUBBLE FORCE MODELS, DISPERSED BUBBLY FLOW,

AND BUBBLE DRAG REDUCTION

I now come back from the predominantly diffusive bubble dynamics to further inertial
bubble phenomena. As explained in section II, the acoustic forces (“Bjerknes forces”) are
the reason why the bubble is pushed towards the pressure antinode where it can oscillate in
the strongest way, possibly even leading to single bubble sonoluminescence [15]. In general,
these acoustic forces will compete with inertial forces such as the added mass force, drag,
and lift, and of course with buoyancy. In 2001, we aimed to understand this competition
in more detail, in order to gain more insight into the hydrodynamic forces on bubbles such
as drag and lift (which had very nicely been reviewed by Magnaudet and Eames [166])
and in order to better control the motion of bubbles in a shear flow with the help of an
external acoustic field. We thus built an experimental setup with an acoustic spherical
glass resonator through which we pumped some liquid in a controlled way, thus generating
controlled shear flow [167]. Remarkably, for certain parameters, the entrapped bubbles
performed a spiralling motion, out of which we could extract various pieces of information
on the drag and in particular on the lift. The work — and follow up work in similarly
controlled geometries such as a rotating horizontal cylinder [168, 169] — also confirmed the
usefulness of the concept of effective bubble forces, even for deformed or oscillating bubbles.
In figure 24, for a bubble spiralling in the rotating horizontal cylinder [169], we show the
