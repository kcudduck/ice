FIG. 2. (a) Acoustic driving pressure P(t) (in red), resulting bubble radius R(t) (in green), and
light intensity I(t) (in blue), as measured by [11]. A negative driving pressure causes the bubble to
expand; when the driving pressure changes sign, the bubble collapses, resulting in a short pulse of
light (marked SL). The figure is taken from ref. [8]. (b) Solutions to the Rayleighâ€”Plesset equation
(1) with a sinusoidal driving P(t) = P,sin(wt) at forcing pressures P, = 1.0,1.1,1.2,1.3 atm. The
ambient bubble radius is Rg = 2um and the frequency f = w/ (27) = 26.5 kHz. Material parameters

survive the collapse, but at the same time would still collapse strongly enough so that the
gas inside the bubble would be considerably heated [18]. Both a parametric instability and
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability turned out to be relevant [15, 18, 19].

Another necessary condition for stable single bubble sonoluminescence is the diffusive
stability of the bubble. Also the diffusive bubble stability had been analysed before, namely
in the seminal work by Epstein and Plesset [20], later extended by Fyrillas and Szeri [21] to
oscillating bubbles, for which rectified diffusion [22-24] can occur: For large pressure, the
bubble loses gas to the outside liquid, but during the low pressure period, it can gain gas
from outside. For very strong driving the growth can win, mainly due to the thin boundary
layer during that time but also due to the much larger bubble size. Applying these ideas
to the regime of sonoluminescing bubbles could account for the experimentally observed
diffusively stable single bubble sonoluminescence [25], and combining the conditions of shape
stability, diffusive stability, and energy focusing led to the phase diagram of sonoluminescing
bubbles [19], which for pure argon bubbles was in good agreement with the experimental
observations.

However, air bubbles were found to be stable for 100 times larger gas saturation than
pure argon bubbles, see figure 3. The reason for this turned out to be the chemical stability
of the gas inside the bubble [26]: The bubble is collapsing so strongly that the gas inside
is nearly adiabatically compressed. This means that the collapse of the bubble is so violent
that no thermal equilibrium with the surrounding water can be established: The bubble is
heating up, to about 15000 K, as we now know both theoretically [27] and experimentally
28]. For molecular gases such as O, or Ny this is much too hot and they dissociate: The
resulting radicals react with each other and with the dissociation products of water vapor.
NO, NH, etc. are formed, which dissolve in water. Therefore it is mainly argon that remains
in the bubble, which is contained in air with a concentration of about 1%, explaining the
