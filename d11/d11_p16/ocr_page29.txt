buca (Italy) or Raki (Turkey)): Ouzo consists of alcohol, water and anise oil, which is very
soluble in alcohol. When served, the ouzo is diluted with water. As a result, the alcohol
concentration and thus the solubility of the oil decreases: Oil droplets then nucleate and
crow in the supersaturated solution. This leads to the known milky appearance of the
ouzo-water mixture. In the presence of a hydrophobic surface, nucleation naturally takes
place at this surface and surface nanodroplets are formed in complete analogy to the surface
nanobubbles. With the help of the control techniques of microfluidics, one can study very
precisely the dependencies of the nucleation process on the control parameters such as flow
velocity, channel thickness, oil concentration, size and shape of the pinning sites etc. and
understand them theoretically and quantitatively [148-150].

The technological relevance of surface bubbles and droplets and the solvent-exchange
process can hardly be underestimated. In our review article [121] we have dedicated a whole
chapter to it; here I restrict myself to some particularly relevant and beautiful examples.

Liquid-liquid extraction — the transfer of a substance from one solvent to another — is
one of the key processes of chemical technology and analysis. Since the work of Nobel Prize
winner Fritz Pregl [151], efforts have been made to further miniaturize processes for chemical
analysis and chromotography. The need to do this has increased in recent years [152]. First,
it 1s important to be able to demonstrate ever smaller traces of chemical substances, be it in
a medical context or for environmental reasons. Moreover, this proof must be fast and small
samples should be sufficient, also to come to a “greener” chemical technology. One way to
achieve this is single drop microextraction, where a substance A dissolved in water slowly
dissolves in a drop of an organic solvent with a much higher solubility for A (e.g. carbon
tetrachloride) held in the water. The drop is then extracted and analyzed. However, this
process generally takes a long time and the efficiency is low.

These limitations were elegantly overcome with the so-called disperse liquid-liquid mi-
croextraction (DLLME) technique [153-155] invented just 12 years ago. The technique in-
volves a third liquid that is miscible with water and with carbon tetrachloride, e.g., ethanol.
If a mixture of carbon tetrachloride and ethanol is now added to the water containing the
substance A to be extracted, instantaneously many nano- and microdroplets of carbon tetra-
chloride nucleate, due to the enhanced water concentrations these molecules experience and
the resulting lower solubility. With their very large total surface area, these nano- and
microdroplets are very efficient to extract the substance A. As a final step, the carbon tetra-
chloride microdroplets are centrifuged off. The highly enriched substance A can then easily
be detected by conventional methods. So far, DLLME is mostly optimized by trial-and-
error; however, to achieve further control and progress, from my point of view it is very
promising to apply the well-controlled methods of microfluidics and fluid dynamics to this
process [156].

A good understanding and control of the diffusive processes in and around microdroplets
and microbubbles may even save lives: in open-heart surgery, the blood stream is decoupled
from the heart and maintained by a heart-lung machine [157] and at the same time the
blood is cooled down. In the cold blood more air dissolves than when it is warm. However,
warming up the patient after surgery can be seen as a solvent-exchange process that can
result in the nucleation of (surface) nano- and microbubbles that may significantly affect
the blood supply locally. Here, too, it is essential and possibly life-saving to well understand
bubble nucleation in diffusive processes.

Further examples are electrolysis and catalysis: In both processes, the forming surface
