Indeed, the singularity (2) in the RP bubble dynamics is reflected in a singularity P(t) ~
(ts —t)~%° in the sound emission.

The second obvious question to ask is: Why is the snapping shrimp doing all this? The
answer is simple: It wants to eat! The emitted sound pulse of the collapsing bubble is so
strong that little fish or shrimp get stunned or even killed by it and are then eaten up by
the snapping shrimp. Our explanation immediately solved another paradox: Why aren’t
there any snapping shrimp in the deep ocean, but only in water up to about 50 m depth
70]? The reason is that the hydrostatic pressure increases with increasing depth so that
eventually the shrimp can no longer generate a cavitating bubble. Thus it would starve in
deeper water.

With our background in single bubble sonoluminescence, we could not resist looking into
possible light emission from the shrimp-produced collapsing bubbles: Indeed, there was a
faint light emission, a phenomenon we called shrimpoluminescence [71].

Sound emission from oscillating or collapsing bubbles is not only relevant for snapping
shrimp, but also on a much larger length scale. Eq. (4) is not only valid in the micrometer
or millimeter range, but can even be employed as an estimate in the meter range, implying
that the resonance frequency of a bubble with an ambient radius By = 1 m is 3 Hz. Such
extremely low frequencies are of great interest, for example, in the oil industry for acoustic
marine geophysical exploration. The giant bubbles are generated with so-called airgun
acoustic sources. Their operating principle is as follows: During the charging process, air is
put under very high pressure in a cavity in the airgun. This air is laterally released during
the discharging process, leading to a giant air bubble with typical diameters of one meter
and beyond. The oscillations of this air bubble leads to sound generation and emission,
according to eq. (5). The sound gets reflected at the ocean-bottom and is detected both
with hydrophone streamers and with ocean bottom seismometers and hydrophones, see
figure 9. To extract the relevant information from these data, low frequencies around 1 Hz
are crucial, whereas high frequencies beyond 120 Hz are attenuated in the earth. This is the
reason why it is essential to generate low frequencies with the airgun (or airgun clusters)
and thus employ big bubbles.

Bubbles of this size will no longer be strictly spherical during their whole period of
life, and this will affect their sound emission behavior, both with respect to intensity and
direction. The way to calculate the dynamics of such large bubbles or voids from the Navier-
Stokes equation (or, to be precise, from its potential flow approximation) are boundary
