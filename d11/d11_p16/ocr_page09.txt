one increase the signal-to-noise ratio? Namely, when detecting the emitted sound from the
bubble at the driving frequency, the signal is obscured by the reflections from tissue. To
improve the signal quality, it had been proposed [40] to detect higher harmonics of the driving
frequency in the sound emission spectrum of the bubble. Vice-versa, also subharmonics had
been suggested for better contrast. The immediate question was: What bubble properties
are optimal for these purposes, in particular what bubble size, for given driving frequency?
This indeed was the question with which the pharmaceutical industry approached us, and
thanks to our work on single bubble sonoluminescence, we could straightforwardly provide an
answer, namely by simply solving the RP equation with the relevant parameter for medical
ultrasound imaging: Here, rather than in the range of 20 kHz — 30 kHz as common for single
bubble sonoluminescence, the typical driving frequencies are between 2 MHz and 10 MHz
and typical bubble radii are a few micrometers. From linearizing the RP equation (1) it
follows that the eigenirequency of the volume oscillations of an acoustically driven bubble
with ambient radius Ry and under isothermal conditions approximately is [1, 12, 41]

This eigenfrequency is called Minnaert frequency. With the material parameters for water
under ambient conditions this gives the well-known rule-of-thumb [41]

foRo ~ 3 MHz pm = 3 kHz mm = 3 Hz m (4)
for the resonance frequency fy = wg/(27). For the frequencies of medical ultrasound imaging,
the resonance radii are thus in the micron range. Also in the fully nonlinear case, thanks
to the full RP equation we could calculate optimal parameter values for maximal sound
emission in the second harmonic and in subharmonics, and could make statements on the
expected bubble shape stability in those regimes [42].

One issue we had first ignored was that the ultrasound contrast agent bubbles are not
“naked”, but coated with lipids and polymers (figure 4b), to avoid the obviously undesirable
bubble clustering in the body and to increase their lifetime. The coating however modifies the
oscillation behavior of the bubble in an a priori unknown way. Therefore, a few years later,
to take the effect of the coating on the bubble dynamics into consideration, we developed
a model to quantitatively describe this modification of the RP dynamics (1), which is now
known as “Marmottant model” [38]. The key idea behind this model is to introduce an
instantaneous bubble-size dependent surface tension, reflecting the buckling behavior of the
bubble coating when compressing the bubble, an elastic regime, and a shell-ruptured regime.
An excellent recent review of such modified bubble dynamics can be found in ref. [39].

To experimentally test such models for the relevant frequencies in the MHz regime, one
unavoidably needs ultra high-speed imaging, with frame rates > 1 MHz. In an effort led
by Nico de Jong and Michel Versluis, we therefore developed [43, 44] an ultrafast camera,
which allows imaging 128 digital frames with a frame rate of up to 25 MHz. We called it
“Brandaris 128”, as it is based on a rotating mirror, just as the famous Dutch lighthouse
Brandaris on Terschelling. This camera allowed us to gain insight into the volume and shape
oscillations of ultrasound contrast agent bubbles [45-47], in particular when combining it
with measurements of the acoustic emission of such coated bubbles [45]. This procedure
allowed us to adjust the model parameters of the Marmottant model [38] to the experimental
