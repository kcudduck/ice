I. INTRODUCTION

“How do you find the problems you work on?” And “What do you think is the difference
between fundamental and applied research?” These are questions I am often asked. My
short answer to the first question is: “Be curious!” And to the second one: “In principle,
none”. And what in particular holds for both fundamental and applied problems, both in
finding and in solving them: “Watch, listen, and be open”. The answer to both questions
can be summarized as: “Work on problems you most enjoy. Strange things can happen on
the way.” (Walter Munk, UCSD). In the best case, the problem to work on is both relevant
and outstanding, at the same time.

In this article I want to take the opportunity to give longer answers to these questions,
in particular by giving examples from my own scientific biography and scientific journey. As
the thread of the article I will choose “bubbles”. I will report how I first incidentally bumped
into the science of bubbles, what and how I learned about them, what wondertul science
and great interactions and collaborations with colleagues this endeavor opened for me, and
how I kept on bumping into very relevant applications of bubbles in technology. So bubbles
have provided me both wonderful scientific problems and very relevant applied questions, to
whose solution, I think, we have contributed over the last two and a halt decades.

The length scales on which bubbles are relevant range from nanometers to at least tens
of meters, and I will give examples for interesting and relevant bubble phenomena on all
these scales. The richness of bubble fluid dynamics is reflected in the many dimensionless
numbers that are relevant in the context of bubbles |1, 2|, namely the

e¢ Reynolds number Re = UR/v, expressing the ratio of inertia forces to viscous forces.

Here U is the bubble velocity, R its radius, and v the kinematic viscosity.

e Froude number Fr = U/+\/gR, ratio of inertia to buoyancy, where ¢ is the gravitational

acceleration.

e Archimedes number Ar = gR?p(p — p,)/n? , ratio of buoyancy to viscosity. p is the

liquid density, n 1ts dynamic viscosity, and p, the gas density.

o Galileo number Ga = gR’/v?, ratio of gravitational to viscous forces,

eo Weber number We = pU?R/co, ratio of inertia to capillarity, where o is the surface

tension.

e Capillary number Ca = nU/0o, ratio of viscous to capillary forces,

e Ohnesorge number Oh = n//pocR = We'/?/Re, ratio of time of viscous damping to

time of the capillary oscillations.

e E6tvos number Fo = (p — p,)gR?/o, also called Bond number Bo, ratio of buoyancy

to capillarity,

eo Stokes number St, ratio of characteristic timescale of bubble to that of the flow,

e Morton number Mo = gn*(p—p,)/(p?c?), which is a material parameter for a bubble in

a certain liquid, depending only on surface tension, density, density contrast, viscosity,
and gravity.
