FIG. 13. (a) Schematic of the ink channel (side view) of a MEMS-based drop-on-demand inkjet
printer. An air bubble has been entrained and pushed to the corner of the ink channel. (b) Droplet
distortion (droplets 28-29) caused by a dirt particle around the jetting nozzle. Such a dirt particle
can lead to bubble entrainment. In the shown case here the normal droplet formation process
recovers and becomes reqular again. Figure taken from ref. [93]. (c) Upper: Infrared bottom view
through the silicon around the nozzle into the ink channel. In the center the nozzle is seen. In three
of the four corners bubbles got entrained which affect the printing process. The nine smaller images
show the diffusive dynamics of the bubbles, clearly revealing bubble growth (by rectified diffusion)
and Ostwald ripening. The times are given in seconds. Images taken by Arjan Fraters, Physics of
Fluids group, Twente, in collaboration with Océ.

developing piezo-acoustic ink-jet printers and obviously various great fluid dynamics chal-
lenges come with this, starting from the flow in the nozzle, to the jetting and droplet process,
down to drop impact, drop spreading and drop-paper interaction, and finally (partial) drop
evaporation or solidification. One of the most burning questions Océ had in those days was
on the fluid dynamics in the print-head.

A schematic cross-section through a typical modern MEMS-based print-head is seen
in figure 13a. The piezo-actuator — similar to the piezo used to generate single bubble
sonoluminescence — gives short pulses with — depending on the printer — a frequency of
around 20 kHz to 100 kHz. Each pressure pulse drives out a little droplet. Altogether,
typically there are presently hundreds of nozzles within one silicon chip and several chips
are integrated in one print-head. A modern inkjet printer has tens of such print-heads.
