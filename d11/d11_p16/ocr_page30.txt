FIG. 22. (a) Confocal images of surface oxygen bubbles in a HsOs-solution (0.1% in water),
growing on a (catalytic) platinum surface, 7.2 s after exposure of the platinum with the peroxide.
Image made by Pengyu Lv, Physics of Fluids, University of Twente. (b) Three snapshots of the
same surface bubble, pinned at a micropit, and growing out of a C'Os-oversaturated solution with
a (pressure controlled) oversaturation of ( = 0.18. Figure taken from ref. [158].

nano- and microbubbles considerably impair the efficiency, as they cover the electrode or
catalyst. How does one control the growth of the bubbles and how to get rid of them?
We have taken some first steps to answer these questions [159-162|. Figure 22a shows
catalytically grown oxygen bubbles on a platinum surface immersed in a hydrogen peroxide
(H>O5) solution. The platinum acts as a catalyst which triggers the decay of the peroxide to
oxygen (evolving in bubbles) and water. For such bubbles evolving out of chemical reactions
the relevant dimensionless number coming into play is the Damkohler number Da, which is
the ratio between the chemical reaction rate and the (diffusive or convective) mass transport
rate. If Da is very large, the chemical reactions is controlled by the latter.

An example of a carbon dioxide bubble which is purely growing by diffusion is shown in
figure 22b. As discussed above, according to the Epstein-Plesset theory [20], for such bubbles
the radius should grow in time with a square-root behavior. As we found in ref. [158], in the
beginning it indeed does, but later on convective effects take over, as the dissolved carbon
dioxide affects the density of water. We also found that in the long term gas depletion effects
become very relevant and bubbles nucleating later at the same location grow much slower
than the earlier ones [163]. After growth, the bubbles finally detach. This happens because
of buoyancy, either directly once they are so large that the buoyant forces overwhelm the
capillary forces (the so-called Fritz radius [75, 164]), or when they coalesce and then detach,
as shown in figure 23. In the context of catalysis and electrolysis, the bubble detachment is
of course advantageous, as pointed out above.

The area of electrolysis and catalysis seems to me to be a very important and promising
future field for physics of fluids, building a bridge from fluid dynamics to process technology
and (colloid) chemistry.
