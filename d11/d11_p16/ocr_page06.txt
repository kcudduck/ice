factor of 100 higher gas concentration required for stable single bubble sonoluminescene
with air as compared to the pure argon (or any other inert gas) case. This theory later got
confirmed through various experimental results, see e.g. [29, 30]. Another advantage of argon
for achieving strong SBSL is that in contrast to Oy or Ny, argon has no internal degrees
of freedom. Thus the focused energy of the bubble collapse can directly be transferred
into heat. The 15000 K which are reached in this way are sufficient to partly ionize the gas.
Recombination of ions and electrons leads to light emission through thermal bremsstrahlung
31, 32]. Later we extended the ideas of chemical stability of ref. [26] to include various
other chemical reactions of air with water [27] to find very good and quantitative agreement
between experimental and theoretical phase diagrams, see figure 3b.

FIG. 3. (a) Phase space of single bubble sonoluminescence in the argon concentration P./Py vs.
driving pressure P,/Py phase plane for pure argon bubbles, showing the three phases “no SL”,
“stable SL” (only possible for very small argon concentrations), and “unstable SL”, where the
bubbles grow by rectified diffusion while emitting light and finally run into a shape instability [19].
Adopted from [19]. (b) Phase space of single bubble sonoluminescence in the bubble radius vs.
driving pressure phase plane for air bubbles, taken from ref. [27]: Bubble equilibrium radius Ry
versus driving pressure P, for three different air concentrations (10%, 20%, and 40% of saturation;
the driving frequency is 33.4 kHz). The curves, signalling stable bubbles, follow from our parameter-
free theory [27]; the data points had been measured by Ketterling and Apfel [30]. The bubble emits
light only on the right curves where argon has accumulated in the bubble (filled diamonds). On the
left curves, the losses by chemical reactions and the growth by rectified diffusion balance.

In a sense, single bubble sonoluminescence can be viewed as illuminated bubble dynamics,
with the RP dynamics as backbone. A combination of concepts from hydrodynamics (both
shape stability and diffusive stability), chemistry, plasma physics, applied mathematics,
thermodynamics, and acoustics led to the phase diagrams, which are in good agreement with
the experiments [15, 27|. In its conceptual simplicity — an isolated, fixed, non-interacting
single bubble in a flask — it can also be seen as “hydrogen atom of bubble fluid dynamics”,
on which we learned a lot.

Our work on sonoluminescence started off as pure fundamental research, driven by cu-
riosity. We had not asked ourselves whether there would be any applications. Single bubble
sonoluminescence simply was a fascinating and outstanding problem, with major open ques-
tions. In answering them, we learned tremendously, including on
