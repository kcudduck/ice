Q For centuries, bubbles have fascinated artists, engineers, and scientists alike. In
@\ spite of century-long research on them, new and often surprising bubble phenomena,
= features, and applications keep popping up. In this paper I sketch my personal
py scientific bubble journey, starting with single bubble sonoluminescence, continuing
cn with sound emission and scattering of bubbles, cavitation, snapping shrimp, impact
— events, air entrainment, surface micro- and nanobubbles, and finally coming to ef-
Ss fective force models for bubbles and dispersed bubbly two-phase flow. In particular,
® I also cover various applications of bubbles, namely in ultrasound diagnostics, drug
~ and gene delivery, piezo-acoustic inkjet printing, immersion lithography, sonochem-
T- istry, electrolysis, catalysis, acoustic marine geophysical survey, and bubble drag
Tp reduction for naval vessels, and show how these applications crossed my way. 1
9 also try to show that good and interesting fundamental science and relevant appli-
2 cations are not a contradiction, but mutually stimulate each other in both directions.
