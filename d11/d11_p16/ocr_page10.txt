data, very nicely reflecting the observed so-called “compression-only” behavior of the UCA
bubbles [38, 45, 48, 49] (see figures 4c¢,d), which is nothing else than — thanks to the bubble
coating — modified RP dynamics, thus giving the ultrasound contrast agent community a
very relevant tool.

Another necessity which arose out of the applications of bubbles as ultrasound contrast
agents was to produce large numbers of relatively monodisperse and coated microbubbles.
The monodispersity is desirable to enhance the scattering property otf the bubbles, which is
optimal close to the bubble resonance size given by eq. (4). We achieved this with a so-called
co-flow device originally developed by Howard Stone, Dave Weitz and coworkers [50-52] and
in the case of bubbles by Gordillo and coworkers [53], but now operated in a regime in which
we could produce particularly small monodisperse bubbles in large quantities [54], see figure
5. Meanwhile this method has been commercialized within a start-up company, as spin-off
from our Physics of Fluids group.

control parameters are the gas flow rate QQg, the liquid flow rate QQy, and the geometric parameters,

The development of the Brandaris 128 ultra-high-speed imaging facility also allowed
us to study the interaction of ultrasonically driven bubbles with cells. This interaction is
sometimes spectacular, as seen in figure 6 [55], which shows a HeLa cell culture (a commonly
used human cell line) grown on a glass plate, just after a bubble has collapsed close to it.
The collapsing bubble exerts such strong shear forces on the cell that they detach from the
class plate, or, if they are more remote, holes in the cell membrane are induced. These holes,
which can close again after some time, allow drugs or genes to invade the cell. Therefore
ultrasonically driven bubbles can be used for local application of genes or drugs. This
includes employing emulsions of droplets composed of liquid perfluorocarbons, which are
acoustically activated to undergo a phase change into a bubbly dispersion, a procedure
termed acoustic droplet vaporization [56].

I take the opportunity to stress the fundamental differences between vapor and gas bub-
bles, which in detail are elaborated and explained by Prosperetti in his recent review on
