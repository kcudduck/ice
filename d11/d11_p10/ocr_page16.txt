FIG. 4: Example of the different treatments of a shock front forming after the collapse of a cavitation bubble
produced by a femtosecond laser, as studied by Liang et al.””. (a) Selected outgoing wave characteristics are shown
in a time-space plot, where the characteristic associated with the minimum radius is seen to intersect previously
emitted characteristics. The thick black line shows the bubble radius. (b) The resulting multivalued density profile
50 ns after the bubble attained its minimum radius. (c¢) Close up of the density profile, to which two different shock
treatments are applied. The clipping of the profile as proposed by Denner and Schenke °° is applied at run time,
whereas the rule of equal areas®’ is applied as a post-processing step.
