FIG. 1: Schematic illustration of the considered (quasi) one-dimensional domains: one-dimensional planar (a = 0),
cylindrical symmetry (a = 1), and spherical symmetry (a = 2). The one-dimensional spatial coordinate is denoted
with r and the width or radius of the gas cavity or bubble is denoted with R.
