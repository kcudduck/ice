The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis for bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions  Fabian Denner 1,   a)  Department of Mechanical Engineering, Polytechnique Montréal, Montréal, H3T 1J4, Québec, Canada  Pressure-driven bubble dynamics is a major topic of current research in fluid dynamics, driven by innovative medical therapies, sonochemistry, material treatments, and geophysical exploration. First proposed in 1942, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis provides a simple means to close the equations that govern pressure-driven bubble dynamics as well as the resulting flow field and acoustic emissions in spherical symmetry. The models derived from the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can be solved using standard numerical integration methods at a fraction of the computational cost required for fully resolved simulations. Here, the theoretical foundation of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and contemporary models derived from it are gathered and reviewed, as well as generalized to account for spherically symmetric, cylindrically symmetric, and planar one-dimensional domains. In addition, the underpinning assumptions are clarified and new results that scrutinize the predictive capabilities of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis with respect to the complex acoustic impedance experienced by curved acoustic waves and the formation of shock waves are presented.   Although the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is built upon simplifying assumptions and lacks some basic acoustic properties, models derived from it are able to provide accurate predictions under the specific conditions associated with pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions.

INTRODUCTION  Pressure-driven bubble dynamics are encountered and play an important role in countless engineering applica- tions and natural phenomena 1–3 . The formation and col- lapse of vapor bubbles ( cf.   hydrodynamic cavitation) are well known to cause material erosion of propellers and hydro turbines 4–6 , and the related acoustic emissions are actively studied and monitored   in situ 7–9 . However, the past decades have seen a paradigm shift in how pressure- driven bubble dynamics and, especially, cavitation are studied, away from treating cavitation solely as a haz- ard, towards leveraging its mechanical and thermal ef- fects.   This has spawned innovative new applications, such as contrast-enhanced medical imaging 10 , intensify- ing chemical reactions 11 , breaking down kidney and uri- nary stones 12,13 , treating tumors 14 , using cavitation as a sonic scalpel for precision surgery 15,16 , targeted drug delivery by ultrasound-driven micro- and nanobubbles 17 , 3D printing with sound 18 , actuating smart materials 19 , and enhancing bioadhesion 20 .   The energy focused by a strong bubble collapse can be utilized to pierce bi- ological cells 21,22 ,   to destruct bacteria for wastewater treatment 23 , to clean surfaces and membranes 24,25 , to synthesize nanoparticles and nanostructured materials 26 , and to manipulate hardened materials, such as metals 27  and glass 28 .   Ferns use cavitation-driven catapults to eject their spores 29   and pistol shrimps use the shock waves   generated   by   collapsing   bubbles   to   stun   their prey 30 .   The pressure and shock waves of underwater explosions are studied for defense purposes as a major  a) fabian.denner@polymtl.ca  component of marine warfare 31–33   and the pressure tran- sients produced by the generation and collapse of un- derwater bubbles are used for seismic surveys in marine and geophysical exploration 34–36 .   The advent of mod- ern monitoring and control techniques for bubble dy- namics, many of which now leverage machine learning algorithms, largely rely on acoustic signals to identify and classify bubble activity 8,37–42 . This, in turn, requires high-fidelity models of the complex bubble dynamics and nonlinear acoustics to classify the related acoustic signa- tures and to train machine learning algorithms. The   Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis 43   is an important tool for fundamental and theoretical research on pressure- driven bubble dynamics, as well as the related fluid dy- namics and acoustics. It stipulates that in spherical sym- metry the quantity  g   =   r    h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2    ,   (1) emitted at the gas-liquid interface of a gas cavity or bub- ble, is constant along outgoing characteristics and prop- agates with speed   c   +   u , where   r   is the radial coordinate,  c   is the liquid speed of sound,   u   is the flow velocity, and  h − h ∞   is the difference in specific enthalpy between radial location   r   and the ambient state denoted with subscript  ∞ .   The power of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis lies in the fact that it enables, in conjunction with a suit- able equation of state, to close the set of equations gov- erning the pressure-driven behavior of gas bubbles and the resulting flow of the surrounding liquid, such that mathematical models for the velocity and pressure gen- erated by a cavitation bubble or an underwater explosion can be derived.   Computer programs developed in the 1960s using models for pressure-driven bubble dynam- ics and acoustics based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypoth-  arXiv:2404.17361v2 [physics.flu-dyn] 4 May 2024

2 esis were also among the first open-source software tools in fluid dynamics 44,45 . Despite the widespread availabil- ity of simulation tools that can predict two- and three- dimensional pressure-driven bubble dynamics in complex scenarios with increasing accuracy and robustness 46–50 , the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and the models derived from it, henceforth collectively referred to as   KBH mod- els , still play an important role for the prediction of pressure-driven bubble phenomena.   Predicting the dy- namic behavior of collapsing bubbles and the pressure transients they produce remains challenging and KBH models have emerged as robust benchmarks for testing and validating these numerical methods 50–54 .   In addi- tion, acoustic emissions can be modulated by different mechanisms 55–57   and, consequently, interpreting acous- tic signals at a distance remains a complex task. To this end, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis has seen a renewed interest over the past years as the basis for gaining an im- proved understanding of the interaction between acoustic emissions and fluid dynamics 57–61 , primarily in relation to pressure-driven bubble dynamics. Although the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and mod- els are well established and widely used today, much of their theoretical foundation is scattered over many insti- tutional reports 45,62–66 , declassified military reports 67–71 , textbooks 31,72–74 , PhD theses 44,75 , and papers 76–82   pub- lished in the years and decades following the report of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   . Many of these formidable works are difficult to obtain and are, thus, often not credited correctly or even overlooked in the modern literature. Further adding to the difficulties associated with gain- ing a comprehensive picture of the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis and models, the original report of Kirkwood and Bethe 43   does not appear to be indexed in scientific databases, meaning that a list of subsequent publications referencing this report is not readily available, and no re- view of the scientific literature related to the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis has been published. The aim of this review is to gather, for the first time, the theoretical foundation of the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis, as well as models derived from it that are still relevant today, in a single document. Moreover, the de- scription of the flow field arising from the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis is further generalized and the analy- sis of the limitations and assumptions underpinning the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is extended. As a first step, Section II provides a short historical overview of major developments and applications related to the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis.   Subsequently, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is derived from the conserva- tion laws governing mass, momentum and energy in Sec- tion III, paying particular attention to the underpinning assumptions.   The application of different equations of state describing the properties of the liquid is presented in Section IV, the equation of motion of the gas-liquid inter- face of a pressure-driven gas bubble or cavity is presented in Section V, and models to describe the flow generated by oscillating or collapsing bubbles and cavities are de- rived in Section VI. The model hierarchy with respect to the Mach number following from the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis is briefly reviewed in Section VII and numerical methods to solve KBH models for the bubble dynamics, flow field and shock waves are discussed in Section VIII. In Section IX, the assumptions and capabilities of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis are further scrutinized and new results are presented.   Conclusions are drawn and open questions are discussed in Section X.  II.   RETROSPECTIVE  The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis was proposed as part of a technical report 43   commissioned by the research of- fice of the United States federal government on predict- ing the pressure wave produced by an underwater explo- sion, completed in 1942 by John G. Kirkwood and Hans A. Bethe. This report focused on obtaining an approxi- mation for the pressure amplitude at some distance from an underwater explosion and, more precisely, the decay constant describing an approximately exponential decay of the peak pressure. To this end, Kirkwood and Bethe focused on the propagation of the shock front, the con- ditions in the liquid behind the shock front, the rapidly expanding gas bubble of burnt detonation products, and the rarefaction wave forming inside the gas bubble. The work of Kirkwood and Bethe was first brought to the attention of a wider audience through the textbook of Cole   31   .  A.   Theoretical foundations  Shortly after its publication, Rice and Ginell   67,68   ex- tended the work of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   to an explosive charge in the shape of an infinite cylinder by consider- ing cylindrical instead of spherical symmetry. Although they found that the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is less accurate in cylindrical symmetry than it is in spherical symmetry, it provided a first glimpse into the dynamics of underwater explosions that are not spherically sym- metric.   The work of Rice and Ginell   67,68   later became the foundation of the studies of Naugol’nykh and Roy   71  on the hydrodynamics of electrical discharges in liquids and of Kedrinskii   80   on cylindrically symmetric underwa- ter explosions. In 1952, Gilmore   62   studied the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis further, focusing, however, on cavitation bub- ble   dynamics   rather   than   on   underwater   explosions. Aside from clarifying some assumptions and exploring the theoretical limits of the Kirkwood-Bethe assumption, Gilmore presented a second-order differential equation of the radial motion of the gas-liquid interface of a spherical gas bubble in a compressible fluid as a result of ambient pressure differences, now known as the   Gilmore model , which has since become a staple of fundamental research on cavitation.   As it contains important terms that are second order with respect to the Mach number of the

3 gas-liquid interface motion, the Gilmore model presents an extension to the models of Herring   83   and Trilling   84  that are bound to first-order acoustics.   In addition, Gilmore   62   also derived models for the flow velocity and pressure induced by a bubble or cavity under different assumptions. Among these models is an ordinary differ- ential equation (ODE) for the flow velocity with respect to the radial coordinate along outgoing characteristics based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, which allows to reconstruct the flow and acoustics resulting from a bubble collapse or oscillation. Generalizing the Gilmore model for spherical bubbles, Kedrinskii and Kuzavov   85  proposed a model of the radial dynamics of bubbles in planar and cylindrical symmetry. Hickling and Plesset   64   published an institutional re- port on a study of the collapse and rebound of an adiabat- ically compressed gas cavity in 1963, using the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis in conjunction with the method of char- acteristics. A shortened version of their report was pub- lished as a paper 76   the following year.   To describe the flow of the liquid surrounding the gas cavity, Hickling and Plesset presented ODEs for both the flow velocity and pressure with respect to time along outgoing characteris- tics based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, although they did not present a detailed derivation of these ODEs. Under the assumptions associated with the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis, the ODE for the flow velocity with respect to time (d u/ d t ) proposed by Hickling and Ples- set   64   is equivalent to the ODE with respect to the radial coordinate (d u/ d r ) of Gilmore   62   . Ivany   44   revisited the theory on cavitation bubble dy- namics and acoustic emissions in a PhD thesis on the collapse of gas cavities, completed in 1965. In this thesis, which was in parts published in a subsequent paper 77 , Ivany presented a detailed derivation of an ODE for the flow velocity in the liquid starting from the momentum and continuity equations by using the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and, in fact, arrived at the same ODE as Hick- ling and Plesset   64   two years prior.   However, while the model presented by Hickling and Plesset required to also solve an ODE for the pressure, Ivany employed an explicit expression for the pressure along outgoing characteristics obtained directly from the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis using the Tait   86   equation of state (EoS), as previously suggested by Gilmore   62   .   In the appendix of the thesis, Ivany   44   carefully explains how the bubble dynamics and the flow field are solved and, remarkably, provides listings of the developed computer codes, written in the   Michi- gan Algorithm Decoder   programming language, making it perhaps the first open-source software for cavitation research.   Shortly after, in 1966, Lilliston   45   provided a computer code written in   Fortran IV   for bubble dy- namics and the resulting flow field based on the work of Gilmore   62   in the appendix of a report on the collapse of a gas-filled cavity. Akulichev   et al.   79   proposed an explicit approximation for the pressure emitted by oscillating bubbles using Rie- mann invariants and the Tait EoS on the basis of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, which does not require ex- plicit knowledge of the generated flow velocity. Moreover, while previous studies 44,62,64   had deliberately avoided the multivalued solutions arising at shock fronts, Akulichev  et al.   79   used the   rule of equal areas 87   to treat such mul- tivalued solutions. As a result, Akulichev and co-workers were able to demonstrate that when the emitted pressure wave forms a shock front, the pressure may be severely overpredicted if the additional dissipation arising at the shock front is not taken into account. All the research reported in the publications discussed above employ the (modified) Tait equation of state 86   to describe the liquid properties, starting with the original work of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   .   The main shortcom- ing of the Tait EoS is that it drastically overpredicts the temperature due to isentropic compression 88–90 .   How- ever, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is not limited to a specific EoS for the liquid. Flynn   63,66   used a tabulated EoS based on the work of Rice and Walsh   91   to define the properties of the liquid.   Unfortunately, however, a copy of one of Flynn’s reports 63   on this matter could not be located (the reference here relies on the account of Ivany   44   ), while the other report 66   does not present the methodology in detail. Recently, Denner   90   extended the Gilmore model using the Noble-Abel stiffened-gas (NASG) EoS and, subsequently, Denner and Schenke   60  used the NASG EoS successfully to model the flow and acoustics induced by cavitation bubbles in conjunction with the models of Gilmore   62   , Hickling and Plesset   64   , and Ivany   44   . These milestones form the foundation of KBH models today. Concurrent and subsequent research efforts have primarily focused on applying these models to various engineering problems, as well as to elucidate the physics of pressure-driven bubble dynamics and acoustics.  B.   Applications  The application in the context of which the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis was originally conceived are underwater explosions, whereby the expansion of burnt gaseous deto- nation products and the emitted shock wave in the water are of primary interest. Early work on this subject, start- ing with the study of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   , focused on predicting the evolution and decay of the peak pressure of the emitted shock wave in spherical 43,92–98   and cylin- drical symmetry 67,68,80,99 . To this end, the main aim was to find an accurate definition for the decay constant   θ   of the approximately exponential decay,   e − t/θ   , of the peak pressure. In the 21st century, the focus has shifted away from approximating the peak pressure in favor of using KBH models to compute and study the full range of dy- namics arising in underwater explosions, including the associated bubble dynamics 100–103 , pressure and shock waves 100,104 , and fluid-structure interaction 105 .   These models have repeatedly been found to be of very high predictive quality 101–104 .   The research into underwater

4 explosions is closely related to subsequent applications of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and, especially, the Gilmore model to predict the bubble dynamics of seis- mic air guns for geophysical exploration and the shock testing of defense vessels 34,106–108 .   For instance, Lan- drø and Sollie   109   proposed a methodology based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis to determine the pressure transients produced by an array of air guns, the results of which Laws, Landrø, and Amundsen   110   found to be in very good agreement with measurements in different experimental scenarios.   Similar methods to predict the pressure field produced by air guns were proposed by Ziolkowski   106,107   .   KBH models were also leveraged to study the influence of rough seas 111   and shallow water 112  on the acoustic signatures of seismic air guns. Other applications in which a strong local energy de- position produces a gaseous bubble that emits pressure waves, and subsequently collapses and rebounces, are cavitation bubbles induced by an electrical discharge or a focused laser beam. Especially laser-induced cavitation has established itself as a widely-used tool to study cavi- tation bubble dynamics 53,113–122   under controllable, pre- cise, and reproducible conditions, both experimentally and computationally.   Mellen   78   was an early adopter of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis in the 1950s, in the form of the Gilmore model,   to provide a theoretical basis for an experimental study of the evolution of a spherical cavity produced by an electrical discharge, re- porting an encouraging agreement between experimen- tal measurements and computational results.   With re- spect to laser-induced cavitation, KBH models have been used, aside from studying the resulting bubble dynam- ics, to understand and quantify the formation and at- tenuation of shock waves 58,59,61,123–128   and the energy partitioning 59,61 .   The results produced by these mod- els have been shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental measurements 58,61,125,126,129 . A major driver of research into pressure-driven bub- ble dynamics over the past decades have been diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications.   In 1984, Vacher, Gimenez, and Goutte   130   used the Gilmore model to show that ultrasound-driven bubbles emit significant energy at the second harmonic of the driving frequency, now a widely used indicator to detect and classify cavitation in medical ultrasound treatments 131 .   Since then, KBH models have been used to study tissue ablation 132–134 , histotripsy 135–137   and   lithotripsy 138   treatments,   laser surgery 124,128 , and ultrasound-driven encapsulated mi- crobubbles, including their dynamic behavior 133,139–143 , bubble-bubble interactions 144   and the associated acous- tic emissions 141,142 . To this end, Gümmer, Schenke, and Denner   142   showed a favorable comparison of the fre- quency spectrum predicted by the Gilmore model for lipid-coated microbubbles with the experimental mea- surements of Song, Moldovan, and Prentice   145   .   To ac- count for the viscoelastic rheology of tissue, Zilonova, Solovchuk, and Sheu   146,147   extended the Gilmore model to include the linear elastic solid model, also known as the Zener model, resulting in a markedly different bubble behavior 143,146,147 . The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis has also been utilized to study other applications of pressure-driven bubble dy- namics, including food processing 148 , the spall forma- tion in aluminium 149 , the treatment of materials 150,151 , material synthesis 26,152,153 , the preferred nucleation of crystals during solidification 154 , surface cleaning 155 , as well as the dynamics of a collapsing cylindrical cavity driven by an annular piston 156 . Studies on sonolumines- cence, whereby ultrasound-driven bubbles emit a light pulse upon collapse 157 , have also directly benefited from KBH models, for instance to estimate the conditions in- sight the bubble during collapse 158–160   and to correlate acoustic measurements to bubble dynamics 161–163 . Aside from specific applications, KBH models have been used extensively to study and elucidate fundamental pressure- driven bubble dynamics and acoustics. Some examples of studies using the Gilmore model to study pressure-driven bubble dynamics include studies on the natural bubble frequency 164 , self-similar bubble behavior 165,166 , period doubling of ultrasound-driven bubbles 166 , the excitation of bubbles with multiple frequencies 167 , as well as the in- fluence of the liquid compressibility 168 , heat transfer 169 , the vapor content 170 , and a narrow confinement 171   on the bubble dynamics.   Moreover, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis has been used to gain quantitative insight into   the   acoustic   emissions   associated   with   pressure- driven bubble dynamics, such as the acoustic noise spec- trum generated by pressure-driven bubbles close to a free surface 172,173 , the acoustic translation of bubbles 174 , and the pressure and shock waves emitted during a strong bubble collapse 58–61,163 .  III.   THE KIRKWOOD-BETHE HYPOTHESIS  The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can be derived using basic fluid dynamics, and the arising definitions and ex- pressions then allow us to close the system of governing equations. In the following, we start in Section III A by bringing the conservation laws governing a fluid flow into a convenient form.   Subsequently, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is derived in Section III B and its major limi- tations are discussed in Section III C.  A.   Governing conservation laws  The conservation of mass, momentum and energy gov- erning a fluid flow are given as D ρ  D t   +   ρ ∇ ·   u   = 0   (2) D u  D t   +  1  ρ   ∇ p   =   1  ρ   ∇ ·   τ   (3) D h  D t   −   1  ρ  D p  D t   =   1  ρ   ( τ   :   ∇ u   − ∇ ·   ˙ q )   ,   (4)

5 where   ρ   is the fluid density,   u   is the flow velocity,   p   de- notes the pressure,   h   is the specific enthalpy,   τ   represents viscous stresses,   ˙ q   is the heat flux due to thermal conduc- tion, and D D t   =   ∂ ∂t   + ( u   · ∇ )   (5) denotes the material derivative operator. The thermody- namic relation d h   =   T   d s   +   d p/ρ   allows us to reformulate the energy equation in terms of the specific entropy   s , such that D s  D t   =   1  ρT   ( τ   :   ∇ u   − ∇ ·   ˙ q )   ,   (6) where   T   is the temperature.   This system of equations is closed with a suitable equation of state (EoS) that defines a relationship between the thermodynamic quan- tities. Since the subsequent derivation is agnostic to the applied EoS, we proceed without assuming a specific EoS and revisit commonly used EoS in Section IV. Assuming that the considered flow is ideal, without viscous dissipation ( τ   = 0 ) and heat conduction (   ˙ q   = 0 ), we obtain the Euler equations: D ρ  D t   +   ρ ∇ ·   u   =   0   (7) D u  D t   +  1  ρ   ∇ p   =   0   (8) D s  D t   =   0 .   (9) This   set   of   governing   equations,   with   which   Kirk- wood and Bethe   43   commenced their work, assumes that changes to the state of the fluid of a sufficiently smooth flow are adiabatic and reversible. Consequently, the flow is   isentropic , as imposed by Eq. (9).   Especially for wa- ter, this turns out to be a good assumption even for pressure waves with a large amplitude, because the re- sulting change in entropy is small.   The previously sug- gested upper limit for the validity of this approximation is   p   =   O ( GPa ) . 43,76   Assuming that the flow is isentropic does, however, not imply that all fluid elements are on the same isentrope, because the entropy may change at a shock front, which is further discussed in Section VIII C. The differential relation of the specific enthalpy for an isentropic fluid is  d h   =  d p ρ   =   c 2   d ρ ρ  ,   (10) with the speed of sound   c   defined as  c 2   =     ∂p ∂ρ    s  ,   (11) where subscript   s   implies a constant entropy. In addition, to account for a time-varying pressure in the far field, we introduce the ambient enthalpy   h ∞   and redefine, in a slight abuse of notation, the specific enthalpy difference as   h   →   h   −   h ∞ .   The ambient enthalpy   h ∞   is spatially invariant ( ∇ h ∞   = 0 ), such that D h ∞  D t   =   ∂h ∞  ∂t   .   (12) Inserting Eq. (10) in the form d ρ   =   ρ   d h/c 2   alongside the ambient enthalpy   h ∞   into the continuity equation, Eq. (7), yields  1  c 2  D h  D t   +   ∇ ·   u   =  1  c 2  ∂h ∞  ∂t   .   (13) For convenience, we also separate the kinetic energy and the rotation of the flow by reformulating the convective velocity derivative as  ( u   · ∇ )   u   =   ∇     u 2  2    −   u   ×   ( ∇ ×   u ) ,   (14) with which the momentum equation, Eq. (8), becomes  ∂ u  ∂t   +   ∇     u 2  2    −   u   ×   ( ∇ ×   u ) +   ∇ h   =   0 .   (15) Note that, since the density and pressure have been re- placed by the specific enthalpy and the speed of sound on the basis of the flow being isentropic, the entropy equa- tion, Eq. (9), is now obsolete.  B.   Hypothesis  The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is typically derived and   applied   under   the   assumption   of   spherical   sym- metry.   However,   it   can   be   derived   more   generally for one-dimensional problems, e.g. exploiting cylindrical symmetry 67 , to explore the influence of the shape of a bubble on its dynamics and the induced flow field. Here, we consider an arbitrary (quasi) one-dimensional domain, illustrated in Figure 1, characterized by the dimension- ality coefficient   α   that defines the effective dimensions of the system:   α   = 0   describing a planar case,   α   = 1   de- scribing cylindrical symmetry, and   α   = 2   describing the conventionally assumed spherical symmetry. Considering a (quasi) one-dimensional flow by exploit- ing the symmetry of the system, we know that the flow is   irrotational , with   ∇ ×   u   = 0 . The continuity equation, Eq. (13), and the momentum equation, Eq. (15), along the one-dimensional spatial coordinate   r   are, therefore, given as  1  c 2     ∂h ∂t   +   u  ∂h ∂r    +   1  r α  ∂ ∂r   ( r α u ) =   1  c 2  ∂h ∞  ∂t   (16)  ∂u ∂t   +   ∂ ∂r     u 2  2    +   ∂h ∂r   = 0 .   (17) Since the flow is irrotational, the velocity may be ex- pressed in terms of the potential   ψ ,  u   =   −   ∂ψ ∂r  ,   (18)

The one-dimensional spatial coordinate is denoted with   r   and the width or radius of the gas cavity or bubble is denoted with   R . with which the continuity and momentum equations can be written as  1  c 2     ∂h ∂t   −   ∂h ∞  ∂t   +   u  ∂h ∂r    −   1  r α  ∂ ∂r    r α   ∂ψ ∂r    = 0   (19)  −   ∂ ∂t ∂ψ ∂r   +   ∂ ∂r     u 2  2    +   ∂h ∂r   = 0 . (20) Integrating Eq. (20) from   r   to   ∞ , assuming the poten- tial   ψ   vanishes at infinity, yields the transient Bernoulli equation,  −   ∂ψ ∂t   +   u 2  2   +   h   −   h ∞   = 0 ,   (21) based on which Kirkwood and Bethe   43   defined the spe- cific kinetic enthalpy as  Ω =   ∂ψ ∂t   =   h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2   .

(23) can be rewritten as a wave equation with a non- linear correction of order   O ( u 2 ) , 43,175  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ψ ∂t 2   − ∇ 2 ψ   =  1  c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    ,   (25) suggesting that the velocity potential   ψ   propagates like a wave.   As discussed in detail by Prosperetti   176   , the finite propagation speed is unimportant in the near field, where the flow behaves similar to an incompressible fluid ( c   → ∞ ), with   ∇ 2 ψ   = 0 , while the perturbations are small in the far field, such that terms of order   O ( u 2 )  become negligible 79 , and Eq. (25) reduces to the classic form of the wave equation,  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ψ ∂t 2   − ∇ 2 ψ   = 0 .   (26) Comparing   the   magnitude   of   the   right-hand   side   of Eq. (25) to   the magnitude of   the second-order   time derivative of the velocity potential on the left-hand side may   be   used   to   quantify   the   local   error   of   using   a wave equation to propagate acoustic information in this case 105 . The work of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   rests on a refor- mulated velocity potential in spherical symmetry, defined as   ϕ   =   rψ . With this new potential, the wave equation, Eq. (25), becomes  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ϕ ∂t 2   −   ∂ 2 ϕ ∂r 2   =   r c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    (27) and the transient Bernoulli equation, Eq. (21), yields  ∂ϕ ∂t   =   r  ∂ψ ∂t   =   r    h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2    ,   (28) which is, in fact, the quantity defined in Eq. (1). Adopt- ing this principle for the general one-dimensional domain considered here, with   α   defining the symmetry of the problem, the reformulated velocity potential is defined as   ϕ   =   r α/ 2 ψ , originally proposed by Rice and Ginell   67   . The wave equation then reads as  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ϕ ∂t 2   −   ∂ 2 ϕ ∂r 2   =   r α/ 2  c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    (29) and the transient Bernoulli equation yields  ∂ϕ ∂t   =   r α/ 2   ∂ψ ∂t   =   r α/ 2    h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2    .

7 The validity of this definition of the velocity potential is further discussed together with the limitations presented by the dimensionality coefficient   α   in Section III C. In principle, the method of characteristics may be ap- plied to solve the wave equation governing the velocity potential and any of its derivatives, even though an ana- lytical solution is not readily obtainable due to the contri- butions of   O ( u 2 ) . 79   The   Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis   stip- ulates that the quantity   g   =   ∂ϕ/∂t , as given by Eq. (30), is constant along an outgoing characteristic, satisfying 43  d g  d t   c  = 0 ,   (31) where the derivative operator along an outgoing charac- teristic is defined as  d d t   c  =   ∂ ∂t   +  d r  d t   c  ∂ ∂r  .   (32) Observing that small disturbances to the velocity po- tential of the fluid propagate like a wave according to Eq. (25), i.e. with speed   c   relative to the flow, Kirkwood and Bethe   43   proposed to approximate the propagation speed along an outgoing characteristic by  d r  d t   c  =   c   +   u.   (33)  C.   Limitations  The assumption of a constant value of   g   =   r α/ 2 ( h   −  h ∞   +   u 2 / 2)   along outgoing characteristics can be justi- fied by the conservation of specific energy when dissi- pative effects are neglected, as it follows from the tran- sient Bernoulli equation. However, the assumptions that the acoustic potential is   ϕ   =   r α/ 2 ψ   and propagates with speed   c   +   u   may entail errors. A plane finite-amplitude acoustic wave moving in one direction ( cf.   simple wave) propagates with speed   c + u , 177  and   c   ±   u   are the eigenvalues of the Euler equations for plane waves, 178   meaning that plane waves travel with the local speed of sound   c   relative to the flow 87 . Moreover, Eq. (33) reduces to the asymptotic speed   c   in the far field, since   u   →   0   for   r   → ∞ , and is consistent with the Chapman-Jouguet condition 179,180   for detonation waves. However, the propagation speed   c   +   u   is not exact. This can be seen by considering the Riemann function   ς   for an isentropic flow 181 ,  ς   =  ˆ   p p ∞  d p ρc   =  ˆ   h h ∞  d h c  .   (34) Introducing   ς   into the continuity and momentum equa- tions, Eqs. (16) and (17), yields  ∂ ∂t   ( ς   +   u ) + ( c   +   u )   ∂ ∂r   ( ς   +   u )   =   −   αuc r   (35)  ∂ ∂t   ( ς   −   u ) + ( c   −   u )   ∂ ∂r   ( ς   −   u )   =   −   αuc r   ,   (36) with the quantities   ς + u   and   ς − u   being so-called   Riemann invariants 181 .   For a plane wave ( α   = 0 ), the Riemann invariant   ς   +   u   propagates with constant value along the right-going characteristic with speed   c   +   u , whereas   ς   −   u  propagates with constant value along the left-going char- acteristic with speed   c   −   u .   When the right-hand side, which accounts for the geometric divergence of, for in- stance, cylindrical ( α   = 1 ) or spherical ( α   = 2 ) domains, is not zero, the Riemann invariants   ς   +   u   and   ς   −   u   do not propagate with   c   +   u   and   c   −   u , respectively. Hence, quantities that are invariant along outgoing characteris- tics of a curved wave do not propagate with speed   c   +   u , rendering Eq. (33) an approximation that becomes more accurate as a curved wave moves outwards or when the velocity is small with respect to the speed of sound 62 . As- suming the (dominant) fluid flow is the result of the bub- ble motion and the associated acoustic emissions only, the velocity is   u   ∝   r − α/ 2   in the far field and, hence, the right-hand side of Eq. (35) decays rapidly with   r − n , where   n   ≥   1 +   α/ 2 . Considering a plane acoustic wave, the acoustic parti- cle velocity   u 1   =   p 1 / ( ρc )   is in phase with the acoustic pressure   p 1 , whereby   p 1   and   u 1   follow from the expan- sions   p   =   p 0   +   p 1   and   u   =   u 0   +   u 1 , and where sub- script   0   denotes the reference or ambient properties of the flow field. However,   u 1   and   p 1   of a curved wave are not in phase 182 . As a consequence, the specific acoustic impedance   z   =   p 1 /u 1   experienced by a curved wave is complex, given for a spherical harmonic wave as 182,183  z   =   ρc   ( kr ) 2   +   ikr  1 + ( kr ) 2   ,   (37) which is dependent on the wavenumber   k   and radial co- ordinate   r , and where   i   denotes the imaginary unit. For large   r , the imaginary part (specific acoustic reactance) vanishes and the real part (specific acoustic resistance) approaches the specific acoustic impedance of a plane wave,   z   =   ρc , whereas the imaginary part dominates for small   r .   KBH models do not account for this complex acoustic impedance and the associated error is investi- gated in Section IX B. The dimensionality coefficient   α   defines the dimen- sion and symmetry of the considered problem. Inserting  ϕ   =   r α/ 2 ψ   in the corresponding wave equation, Eq. (29), reads as  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ( r α/ 2 ψ )  ∂t 2   −   ∂ 2 ( r α/ 2 ψ )  ∂r 2   =   r α/ 2  c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    ,  (38) which, after expanding the left-hand side and dividing by  r α/ 2 , becomes  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ψ ∂t 2   −     ∂ 2 ψ ∂r 2   +   α r ∂ψ ∂r   |   {z   }  ∇ 2 ψ,   Eq. (24)  −   α ( α   −   2) 4 r 2   ψ  =  1  c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    .   (39)

8 The last term on the left-hand side vanishes for plane ( α   = 0 ) and spherical ( α   = 2 ) waves, such that Eq. (39) is identical to Eq. (25).   This means that the potential  ψ   and the shape of plane and spherical waves of small amplitude, where   u 2   ≪   c 2 , remain unchanged as they propagate away from the emitter.   However, the corre- sponding wave equation for cylindrical waves ( α   = 1 ),  1  c 2  ∂ 2 ψ ∂t 2   − ∇ 2 ψ   +   ψ  4 r 2   =  1  c 2     ∂u 2  ∂t   +  1 2   u  ∂u 2  ∂r    ,   (40) contains a spurious term proportional to   1 /r 2   and pro- vides an accurate solution only in the asymptotic limit  r   → ∞ . 67,184   In fact, in the interval   0   ≤   α   ≤   2 , the spu- rious term in Eq. (39) is largest for   α   = 1 , and Rice and Ginell   67,68   reported more accurate results for cylindrical underwater explosions with   α   = 0 . 8 . In   summary,   the   assumptions   underpinning   the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis are, strictly speaking, valid only when either the wavelength is relatively small, such that the plane wave assumption is valid 185 , or when the Mach number of the induced flow is small.   The var- ious modelling errors of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothe- sis vanish in the asymptotic limits   r   → ∞ , representing the far field, or   u   →   0 , representing the linear acoustic regime. More generally, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can be regarded as an extrapolation of the linear acoustic theory 176   and, as briefly revisited in Section VII, is part of a consistent hierarchy of models 60,186 .   Nevertheless, as further discussed in Section IX, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis provides accurate predictions under the spe- cific conditions associated with pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions.  IV.   LIQUID EQUATION OF STATE  The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis does not assume a specific   equation   of   state   (EoS)   for   the   liquid,   even though it is almost always presented and used in con- junction with the modified Tait EoS 86 , which Kirkwood and Bethe   43   used in their original work.   Similarly, the influential works of Cole   31   on underwater explosions and Gilmore   62   on cavitation also used the modified Tait EoS. The reasons for the popularity of this EoS are rather straightforward:   it has a simple analytical form and it provides an accurate (isentropic) relationship between the pressure   p , the specific enthalpy   h , the density   ρ , and the speed of sound   c   of water,   even when com- pared against modern standards, such as the IAPWS R6-95(2018) standard 187 . While   the   original   Tait   EoS   is   formulated   along isotherms 86 ,  −     ∂v ∂p    T  =   1  n   [ p   +   B ( T   )]   ,   (41) where   v   = 1 /ρ   is the specific volume,   n   is the polytropic exponent, and   B   is a pressure constant, the modified Tait EoS used widely in conjunction with the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is formulated along isentropes 31  −   1  v     ∂v ∂p    s  =   1  n   [ p   +   B ( s )]   ,   (42) which is, in essence, the isentropic (or, more generally, polytropic) form of the stiffened-gas EoS 188,189 .   The modified Tait EoS defines the fluid properties based on the pressure   p   as  h   =   n n   −   1  p   +   B ρ   (43)  ρ   =   ρ 0     p   +   B p 0   +   B     1  n  (44)  c   =  s  n  p   +   B ρ   ,   (45) where subscript   0   defines a reference state.   For water, commonly used values are   n   ≈   7   and   B   ≈   3   ×   10 8   Pa, or   B   ≈   ρ 0 c 2 0 /n . 43   The reference density, pressure and speed of sound of water are typically assumed to be  ρ 0   ≈   1000   kg/m 3 ,   p 0   ≈   10 5   Pa, and   c 0   ≈   1500   m/s, re- spectively.   Figure 2 shows the density, speed of sound and temperature predicted by the Tait EoS in compari- son to the IAPWS R6-95(2018) standard. The polytropic exponent for an isentropic flow repre- sents the ratio of specific heats, which is approximately unity for water and other liquids. Thus, the large poly- tropic exponent for water,   n   ≈   7 , points to the main shortcoming of the Tait EoS: it severely overpredicts changes in temperature as a result of adiabatic compres- sion or expansion 89,90 ,  T   =   T 0     p   +   B p 0   +   B   ( n − 1) /n  ,   (46) as seen in Figure 2.   In fact, during a violent bubble collapse, the Tait EoS may predict the temperature of the liquid in the vicinity of the gas-liquid interface to be higher than the temperature inside the gas bubble 90 , which is unphysical on account of the considerably larger heat capacity of liquids compared to gases. To rectify this shortcoming of the Tait EoS and, simi- larly, the stiffened-gas EoS, Le Métayer and Saurel   88   pro- posed the Noble-Abel stiffened-gas (NASG) EoS, which had already been postulated in similar (isothermal) form by Tammann   191   .   The NASG EoS extends the Tait and stiffened-gas EoS by introducing the co-volume   b  that represents the finite volume occupied by the fluid molecules, rendering the NASG EoS a simplified version of the van-der-Waals EoS 192   with constant coefficients   B  and   b . For an isentropic flow the specific enthalpy, den-

Just like the Tait EoS, to which it reduces for   b   = 0 , the NASG EoS is unconditionally convex 88 , making it an equally robust alternative to the Tait EoS. The temperature as a result of adiabatic com- pression and expansion is also for the NASG EoS given by Eq. (46).   Different model constants for the NASG EoS of water have been proposed in recent years, as listed in Table I and shown in Figure 3.   In particular the model constants for isentropic water proposed by Denner and Schenke   60   exhibit a very good agreement with the IAPWS R6-95(2018) standard. The NASG EoS was first used in conjunction with the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothe- sis in the Gilmore-NASG model for bubble dynamics by Denner   90   and, using the theory derived in Section VI for spherical bubbles, to model the full flow field introduced by cavitation bubbles by Denner and Schenke   60   . Other equations of state, such as the van-der-Waals EoS or any tabulated EoS, may also be applied in con- junction with the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. However, the simplicity and robustness of the Tait EoS and, more recently, the NASG EoS have prevailed so far.  V.   BUBBLE DYNAMICS  The propagation of the invariant   g   along outgoing char- acteristics, as stipulated by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypoth- esis, can be readily employed to derive the equation of motion of the gas-liquid interface of a gas bubble or cav- ity. Expanding Eq. (31) under consideration of the time- dependent ambient enthalpy defined by Eq. (12) yields  r   D h  D t   −   r   D h ∞  D t   +   ru   D u  D t   +   rc     ∂h ∂r   +   u  ∂u ∂r    +   α  2    h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2     d r  d t   c  = 0 .   (50) Expressions for the spatial derivatives of the flow velocity and specific enthalpy follow by rearranging the continuity and momentum equations, Eqs. (16) and (17), as  ∂u ∂r   =   −   1  c 2     D h  D t   −   D h ∞  D t    −   αu r   (51)  ∂h ∂r   =   −   D u  D t  ,   (52) respectively.   Inserting Eqs. (33), (51), and (52) into Eq. (50), we obtain  r     D h  D t   −   D h ∞  D t    +   r   D u  D t   ( u   −   c )   −   ru c     D h  D t   −   D h ∞  D t    −   αcu 2   +   α  2    h   −   h ∞   +   u 2  2    ( c   +   u ) = 0 .

The reference temperature is  T 0   = 298 . 3   K. Evaluating this equation at the gas-liquid interface ( r   =  R ) yields a second-order ODE describing the change in radius   R   of a gas bubble or cavity, given as  1   −   ˙ R c L  !  R   ¨ R   +  3 4   α   1   −   ˙ R  3 c L  !  ˙ R 2  =   α  2   1 +   ˙ R c L  !  H   +   1   −   ˙ R c L  !  R   ˙ H c L  ,   (54) with   H   =   h L   −   h ∞   and   ˙ H   =  ˙ h L   −   ˙ h ∞ , where   ˙ ♢   =   D ♢ / D t  denotes the material derivative at the gas-liquid interface and the subscript   L   denotes quantities of the liquid at the gas-liquid interface.   In this general form, Eq. (54) was first presented by Kedrinskii and Kuzavov   85   , while in spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ), Eq. (54) is the well-known Gilmore equation 62  1   −   ˙ R c L  !  R   ¨ R   +  3 2   1   −   ˙ R  3 c L  !  ˙ R 2  =   1 +   ˙ R c L  !  H   +   1   −   ˙ R c L  !  R   ˙ H c L  .   (55) Note that the assumption of a cylindrical or spherical bubble, as well as the assumption of a spatially invariant ambient enthalpy   h ∞ , are only valid if   λ ∞   ≫   R , 193,194  where   λ ∞   is the wavelength of   h ∞ ( t ) . The specific enthalpy   h L   incorporates the kinematic boundary conditions at the gas-liquid interface. Consid- ering a Newtonian liquid and a clean gas-liquid interface without surface-active substances, the liquid pressure   p L  at the gas-liquid interface is defined as 195  p L   =   p G   −   ασ R   −   2 α  μ   ˙ R R  ,   (56) where   σ   is the surface tension coefficient and   μ   is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid. The Gilmore model has also been used in conjunction with viscoelastic materials surrounding the gas bubble 143,144,146,196   and considering a coated gas-liquid interface 60,142–144 . The gas pressure inside the bubble,   p G , is defined by an appropriate EoS as a function of the bubble size. As- suming the gas to be ideal, the pressure in the bubble to be spatially uniform and the compression to be adiabatic, the gas pressure of a cavitation bubble under considera- tion of the dimensionality parameter   α   is given as  p G   =   p G , 0     R α +1 0  R α +1   γ  ,   (57) where   p G , 0   is the gas pressure at initial radius   R 0   and   γ  is the ratio of specific heats (or, more generally, the poly- tropic exponent) of the gas. The finite volume occupied by the gas molecules, which becomes important during a strong bubble collapse, can be taken into account by the van-der-Waals hardcore radius   r hc , 157   such that  p G   =   p G , 0     R α +1 0   −   r α +1  hc  R α +1   −   r α +1  hc   γ  .   (58) Alternatively, the same can be achieved with the Noble- Abel (NA) EoS 197,198 , a simplification of the NASG EoS discussed in Section IV, with which the gas pressure and density as a result of adiabatic compression are defined as 90  p G   =   p G , 0     ρ G (1   −   b ρ G,0 )  ρ G , 0 (1   −   b ρ G )   γ  (59)  ρ G   =   ρ G,0     R 0  R   α +1  ,   (60) respectively, where   ρ G,0   is the gas density at pressure   p G , 0  and   b   is the co-volume of the gas.   More elaborate gas models that dispense with the polytropic relation or use more complex gas equations of state 199–201 , account for heat transfer 202–206 ,   mass transfer 34,124,200,201,206 ,   and external damping effects 34   can also be readily applied in conjunction with the Gilmore model. For underwater explosions, the Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) EoS 207,208   is a popular choice in conjunction with the Chapman-Jouguet isentrope 179,180   to describe the properties of the gaseous detonation products constituting the bubble and to pro- vide initial conditions for the velocity of the gas-liquid interface 98,100–102,104,209–211 .

11 The Gilmore equation for spherical bubbles, Eq. (55), has been shown in many studies to yield remarkably accurate results, which Prosperetti and Lezzi 212,213   at- tributed to the fact that the specific enthalpy of the liq- uid is retained in the equation of motion. Even though the Gilmore equation contains some high-order terms, it is not consistently second-order accurate with respect to the Mach number of the gas-liquid interface.   Ben- jamin   214   pointed to missing second-order terms in the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, which was met with some skepticism by Plesset (see the discussion on p. 232-233 in the book edited by Cooper   72   ), although similar second- order errors in the Gilmore model 62   were later identified by Tilmann   194   and Prosperetti and Lezzi   212   . Lezzi and Prosperetti   213   proposed a more elaborate equation of motion for pressure-driven dynamics of spherical bubbles that is second-order accurate with respect to the Mach number, which was, however, derived under the explicit assumption that the velocity of the induced flow is small. Recent studies 98,101,104   have used the model of Lezzi and Prosperetti   213   in conjunction with the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis successfully to predict the pressure transients and shock waves generated by underwater explosions.  VI.   FLOW FIELD AROUND A BUBBLE  The flow field generated by an oscillating or collaps- ing bubble, or an underwater explosion, can be predicted with expressions derived from the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis in conjunction with the appropriate conserva- tion laws.   To this end, the original work of Kirkwood and Bethe   43   , as well as subsequent studies by Rice and Ginell   67,68   , Akulichev   et al.   79   , and Kedrinskii   80   focused on deriving models for the evolution of the peak pressure of a shock wave emitted by an underwater explosion or a pressure-driven bubble, leveraging the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis together with the Rankine-Hugoniot condi- tions. Since the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions follow from the governing conservation laws at shock discontinuities, these peak-pressure models can be seen a special case of the more general descriptions of the flow field devised by Gilmore   62   , Hickling and Plesset   64   , and Ivany   44   . The enthalpy of the fluid is readily obtained by rear- ranging Eq. (30) as  h   =   h ∞   +   g r α/ 2   −   u 2  2   ,   (61) where the invariant   g   is defined by Eq. (30), using the conditions under which it originates at the gas-liquid in- terface ( R   =   r ), as  g   =   R α/ 2   Ω L   =   R α/ 2   h L   −   h ∞   +   ˙ R 2  2  !  .   (62) Inserting Eq. (62) into Eq. (61), the specific enthalpy at radial location   r   and time   t   is  h ( r, t ) =   h ∞ ( t ) +     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   α/ 2  Ω L ( τ   )   −   u ( r, t ) 2  2   ,   (63) where   τ   =   t   −   r/ ( c   +   u )   is the retarded time that cor- responds to the time at which the invariant   g   or, like- wise, the specific kinetic enthalpy   Ω   are emitted at the gas-liquid interface.   This definition of the specific en- thalpy satisfies the boundary condition   h ( R, τ   ) =   h L ( τ   )  at the gas-liquid interface ( r   =   R ). Considering, in addi- tion, that   h ∞   is an explicitly imposed ambient enthalpy and the radial position   r   can be obtained by integrat- ing Eq. (33), the flow velocity   u   is the only remaining unknown. Eqs. (33) and (63), in conjunction with either the ex- plicit expression, Eq. (69), or the differential equation, Eq. (75), for the flow velocity derived below, describe the flow field induced by a bubble or cavity with varying size, assuming the induced flow is isentropic.  A.   Explicit expression for the flow velocity  By directly inserting the velocity potential   ψ   =   ϕ/r α/ 2  into the definition of the velocity given by Eq. (18), sim- ilar to the derivation of the quasi-acoustic description of the flow field presented by Gilmore   62   and Trilling   84   , we obtain  u   =   α ϕ  2   r 1+ α/ 2   −   1  r α/ 2  ∂ϕ ∂r  .   (64) Making the assumption that the potential   ϕ   propagates with constant value along outgoing characteristics, d ϕ  d t   c  =   ∂ϕ ∂t   +   d r  d t   c  ∂ϕ ∂r   = 0 ,   (65) allows us to write  ∂ϕ ∂r   =   −   d r  d t  − 1  c  ∂ϕ ∂t  .   (66) Inserting this expression into Eq. (64) with the propaga- tion velocity given by Eq. (33) and   g   =   ∂ϕ/∂t , the flow velocity is defined as  u   =   α ϕ  2   r 1+ α/ 2   +   g r α/ 2 ( c   +   u )   .   (67) This explicit expression of the flow velocity can already be found in the original report of Kirkwood and Bethe   43  for spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ) as well as in the report of Rice and Ginell   68   for cylindrical symmetry ( α   = 1 ). Evaluating Eq. (67) at the gas-liquid interface ( R   =   r ), we find the invariant potential   ϕ   to be defined as  ϕ   =  2  α    R 1+ α/ 2   ˙ R   −   R   g c L   +  ˙ R    .   (68)

12 Inserting Eqs. (62) and (68) into Eq. (67), the velocity at radial location   r   and time   t   is  u ( r, t ) =     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   1+ α/ 2     ˙ R ( τ   )   −   Ω L ( τ   )  c L ( τ   ) +  ˙ R ( τ   )    +     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   α/ 2   Ω L ( τ   )  c ( r, t ) +   u ( r, t )   ,   (69) which satisfies the boundary condition   u ( R, τ   ) =   ˙ R ( τ   )   at the gas-liquid interface ( r   =   R ). The   explicit   expression   of   the   velocity   given   by Eq. (69) separates the flow velocity into three distinct contributions 60 : the first term is the incompressible dis- placement of the fluid by the moving gas-liquid interface, the second term represents the compression/expansion of the fluid resulting from its displacement, and the third term is the particle velocity associated with the emitted acoustic wave. Hence, the first two terms represent hy- drodynamic contributions and the third term represents the acoustic contribution to the flow field. However, the assumption that the potential   ϕ   propagates as an out- going wave with constant amplitude is valid only if the nonlinear terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (29) are negligible.   Hence, Eq. (67) is accurate only if the flow velocity is sufficiently small,   u 2   ≪   c 2 .  B.   Differential equation for the flow velocity  Alternative to the explicit expression for the flow veloc- ity presented in the previous section, it is also possible to derive an ODE describing the flow velocity, as proposed by Gilmore   62   and Hickling and Plesset   64   , without the assumption that   ϕ   retains a constant value as it prop- agates outward.   To this end, the continuity equation, Eq. (16), is added to the momentum equation, Eq. (17), to obtain  1  c     ∂h ∂t   +   u  ∂h ∂r    +   c  ∂u ∂r   +   αuc r   +   ∂u ∂t  +   u  ∂u ∂r   +   ∂h ∂r   =  1  c ∂h ∞  ∂t   .   (70) This equation may be rearranged as  1  c     ∂h ∂t   + ( c   +   u )   ∂h ∂r    +   ∂u ∂t   + ( c   +   u )   ∂u ∂r  =   −   αuc r   +  1  c ∂h ∞  ∂t   ,   (71) which is, considering that the ambient specific enthalpy  h ∞   is assumed to be spatially invariant, equivalent to the equation for the outgoing Riemann invariant, see Eq. (35). Thus, the derivation of a differential equation for the flow velocity starts from the equation governing a curved Riemann wave in an isentropic flow. This fur- ther shows that the propagation speed   c   +   u , albeit only approximately accurate, is inferred by the governing con- servation laws. The enthalpy derivative along outgoing characteristics follows from Eq. (71) as  d h  d t   c  =   − c   d u  d t   c  −   αuc 2  r   +   ∂h ∞  ∂t   .   (72) Taking the derivative of Eq. (30) along an outgoing char- acteristic reads as  d g  d t   c  =   αg  2 r  d r  d t   c  +   r α/ 2   d h  d t   c  −   r α/ 2   d h ∞  d t   c  +   r α/ 2 u   d u  d t   c  = 0 ,   (73) where   (d g/ d t ) c   = 0   by virtue of the Kirkwood-Bethe hy- pothesis, and   (d h ∞ / d t ) c   =   ∂h ∞ /∂t , since   h ∞   is spatially invariant by definition. Inserting Eq. (73) into Eq. (72),  ∂h ∞  ∂t   −   αg  2 r (1+ α/ 2)  d r  d t   c  −   u   d u  d t   c  =   − c   d u  d t   c  −   αuc 2  r   +   ∂h ∞  ∂t   ,   (74) the derivative of the flow velocity   u   along an outgoing characteristic is given as  d u  d t   c  =   α r ( c   −   u )     g  2   r α/ 2  d r  d t   c  −   uc 2    ,   (75) or, by inserting Eq. (33),  d u  d t   c  =   α r ( c   −   u )     g  2   r α/ 2   ( c   +   u )   −   uc 2    .   (76) In spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ), Eq. (76) corresponds to the ODE first presented by Hickling and Plesset   64   ,  d u  d t   c  =   1  r ( c   −   u )  h   g r   ( c   +   u )   −   2 uc 2 i  .   (77) The derivation of this ODE for the flow velocity in the way presented here follows the derivation presented for the special case of spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ) by Ivany   44   . An ODE for the flow velocity with respect to the ra- dial coordinate may be obtained by dividing Eq. (76) by Eq. (33),  d u  d r   c  =  d u  d t   c  d r  d t  − 1  c  =   α r ( c   −   u )     g  2   r α/ 2   −   uc 2  c   +   u    ,   (78) an ODE first proposed by Gilmore   62   for spherical sym- metry ( α   = 2 ) using the modified Tait EoS.

13  C.   Liquid pressure  With an EoS for the liquid at hand, the pressure of the liquid can be computed based on the specific enthalpy   h . Using the modified Tait EoS, the pressure of the liquid follows by inserting Eq. (44) into Eq. (43) to obtain  p   =  "  ( n   −   1) ρ 0  n   ( p 0   +   B ) 1 /n   h  #   1 1 − 1 /n  −   B   (79) or, using Eqs. (43) and (61), the pressure can be com- puted based on the invariant   g ,  p   =   ρ     p ∞   +   B ρ ∞  +   n   −   1  n     g r α/ 2   −   u 2  2    −   B,   (80) as introduced for spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ) by Ivany   44  and, later, Ebeling   81   .   The pressure amplitude   ∆ p   =  p   −   p ∞   is dominated by the term   g/r α/ 2 , especially in the far field where   u   →   0 , thus recovering the well-known amplitude decay with   1 /r   in spherical symmetry ( α   = 2 ) and   1 / √ r   in cylindrical symmetry ( α   = 1 ). 87   With the NASG EoS, the liquid pressure follows from Eqs. (47) and (61) in a similar manner as  p   =  ( n   −   1) ρh   −   (1   −   bρ ) nB n   −   bρ   .   (81) Since   p   and   ρ   depend explicitly on each other, Eqs. (80) and (81) may require an iterative evaluation 60 , in order to reach a desired accuracy. Alternatively, inserting Eq. (76) into Eq. (73), and re- arranging for the enthalpy derivative yields d h  d t   c  =   α r ( c   −   u )  h  u 2 c 2   −   g  2 r α/ 2   ( c   +   u ) c  i  +   ∂h ∞  ∂t   .   (82) By applying Eq. (10), the ODE for the pressure along outgoing characteristics follows as d p  d t   c  =   ρα r ( c   −   u )  h  u 2 c 2   −   g  2 r α/ 2   ( c   +   u ) c  i  +   ∂p ∞  ∂t   ,   (83) which may be solved together with the ODEs for the radial position, Eq. (33), and the velocity, Eq. (76). As- suming spherical symmetry in conjunction with the mod- ified Tait EoS, and neglecting ambient pressure changes, Eq. (83) simplifies to d p  d t   c  =   ρ 0  r ( c   −   u )     p   +   B p 0   +   B   1 /n   h  2 u 2 c 2   −   g r   ( c   +   u ) c  i  ,  (84) which has been used frequently instead of Eq. (80).  VII.   MODEL HIERARCHY  KBH   models   for   pressure-driven   bubble   dynamics and   acoustics   are   part   of   a   consistent   hierarchy   of models 60,71,176,186   that can be established by successive simplifications of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. Assuming   u 2   ≪   c 2 0   and constant fluid properties ( ρ   =  ρ 0 ,   c   =   c 0 ), such that the EoS of the liquid becomes obsolete, the potential   ψ   =   ϕ/r α/ 2   is governed by the wave equation  1  c 2 0  ∂ 2 ψ ∂t 2   − ∇ 2 ψ   = 0 ,   (85) the propagation speed along outgoing characteristics is constant, d r  d t   c  =   c 0 ,   (86) and the specific enthalpy is defined by the first-order ap- proximation   h   =   p/ρ 0 .   The pressure, consequently, fol- lows from Eq. (61) as  p   =   p ∞   +   ρ 0     g r α/ 2   −   u 2  2    ,   (87) which neglects terms proportional to   c − 2 0   and higher. Considering Eq. (86), the explicit expression for the flow velocity, Eq. (67), simplifies to  u   =   α ϕ  2   r 1+ α/ 2   +   g r α/ 2 c 0  .   (88) Based on Eqs. (87) and (88), the invariants   g   and   ϕ   are defined at the gas-liquid interface ( r   =   R ), such that the boundary conditions are satisfied, as  g   =   R α/ 2   p L   −   p ∞  ρ 0  +   ˙ R 2  2  !  (89)  ϕ   =   2  α    R 1+ α/ 2   ˙ R   −   R  g c 0    .   (90) This   presents,   in   fact,   the   quasi-acoustic   model   of Gilmore   62   and Trilling   84   , generalized with respect to the dimensionality coefficient   α .   Although this quasi- acoustic model incorporates a finite wave speed, it can- not describe the nonlinear distortion of acoustic waves and the formation of shock fronts, since all parts of a wave propagate with the same constant speed   c 0 .   Ap- plying the same simplifications to the ODE for the radial bubble dynamics, Eq. (54), and neglecting the term pro- portional to   c − 2 0   , yields a generalized form of the Keller- Miksis equation, 215  1   −   ˙ R c 0  !  R   ¨ R   +  3 4   α   1   −   ˙ R  3   c 0  !  ˙ R 2  =   α  2   1 +   ˙ R c 0  !  p L   −   p ∞  ρ 0  +   R   ˙ p L   −   ˙ p ∞  ρ 0   c 0  .   (91) The quasi-acoustic model and the Keller-Miksis equation are first-order accurate with respect to the Mach number and, thus, limited to small Mach numbers,   (  ˙ R/c 0 ) 2   ≪   1 .

14 Going one step further by assuming the fluid is incom- pressible, with   c 0   → ∞ , the velocity potential is governed by   ∇ 2 ψ   = 0   and the propagation speed along outgo- ing characteristics is infinite. The pressure in the liquid is given by Eq. (87) and the flow velocity follows from Eq. (88) as  u   =     R r   1+ α/ 2  ˙ R.   (92) With   c 0   → ∞ , the ODE for the radial bubble dynamics, Eq. (91), further reduces to a generalized form of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation 1,195,216 ,  R   ¨ R   +  3 4   α   ˙ R 2   =   α ( p L   −   p ∞ ) 2 ρ 0  .   (93)  VIII.   SOLUTION METHODS  The equations governing the bubble dynamics and the equations describing the flow field can be solved inde- pendent of each other. From the viewpoint of the bubble dynamics, this is possible because the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis connects the kinematic conditions at the gas- liquid interface to the spatially invariant ambient con- dition at an assumed infinite distance.   The flow field, in turn, is defined by discrete pieces of information that evolve along a single spatial dimension with speed   c   +   u  and are connected to their initial conditions originating at the gas-liquid interface by the invariant   g . The solu- tion methods presented in this section are implemented in the open-source software library   APECSS 196 .  A.   Bubble dynamics  In order to solve the equation of motion of the gas- liquid interface, Eq. (54), we require expressions for the specific enthalpy difference   H   and its derivative   ˙ H . The specific enthalpy difference can be computed using a suit- able EoS in conjunction with the liquid pressure at the gas-liquid interface   p L   and the ambient pressure   p ∞ . Considering   a   Newtonian   liquid,   p L   is   given   by Eq. (56). Since d h   =   d p/ρ   for the considered isentropic flow, the derivative of the specific enthalpy difference is defined as  ˙ H   =   ˙ p L  ρ L  −   ˙ p ∞  ρ ∞  =   1  ρ L    ˙ p G   +   ασ R 2   ˙ R  +2 αμ   ˙ R 2  R 2   −   2 αμ   ¨ R R  !  −   ˙ p ∞  ρ ∞  .   (94) Inserting Eq. (94) into Eq. (54) and gathering the   ¨ R - terms on the left-hand side yields    c L R   +  2 αμ ρ L    ¨ R   =   α  2  c L   +  ˙ R c L   −   ˙ R  H   −   3 c L   −   ˙ R c L   −   ˙ R  ˙ R 2  2  !  +  R ρ L  ˙ p G   +   ασ R 2   ˙ R   + 2 αμ   ˙ R 2  R 2  !  −   R   ˙ p ∞  ρ ∞  .   (95) We can solve this second-order ODE by separating it into two first-order ODEs for   ˙ R   and   ˙ U   =  ¨ R , such that at each time instance   t j   we integrate the equations  ˙ R j +1   =   U j   (96) and  ˙ U j +1   =   α  2 A j  c L ,j   +  ˙ R j  c L ,j   −   ˙ R j  H j   −   3 c L ,j   −   ˙ R j  c L ,j   −   ˙ R j  ˙ R 2  j  2  !  +   R j  A j  ˙ p G ,j  ρ L ,j  +   ασ   ˙ R j  R 2  j   ρ L ,j  +  2 αμ   ˙ R 2  j  R 2  j   ρ L ,j  −   ˙ p ∞ ,j  ρ ∞ ,j  !  ,   (97) where  A j   =   c L ,j   R j   +  2 αμ ρ L ,j  .   (98) The embedded fifth-order Runge-Kutta scheme of Dor- mand and Prince   217   , which adapts the numerical time step   ∆ t j   =   t j   −   t j − 1   based on the estimated solution er- ror, is a common choice to integrate this system of ODEs, as it is, for instance, the basis of the   ode45   function in Matlab, the default solver of the   solve_ivp   function of the SciPy package, and used in the solver of the open- source cavitation software library   APECSS 196 .  B.   Flow field  To solve the flow velocity and specific enthalpy (or pressure), the information originating at the gas-liquid interface is tracked along the outgoing characteristics, whereby each parcel of information propagates on its own characteristic with velocity   c + u . To this end, the bubble radius   R j   , the speed of the gas-liquid interface   ˙ R j   , and the specific enthalpy of the liquid at the gas-liquid inter- face   h L ,j   obtained by solving Eqs. (96) and (97) serve as the initial conditions. The invariant   g   of information parcel   i   is defined upon emission at the gas-liquid interface, at emission time   τ i , as  g i   =   R ( τ i ) α/ 2  "  h L ( τ i )   −   h ∞ ( τ i ) +   ˙ R ( τ i ) 2  2  #  .   (99) The radial position   r i,j   and flow velocity   u i,j   of each in- formation parcel   i   at time   t j   result from Eqs. (33) and (75), by integrating  d r  d t   c ( i,j )  =   c i,j   +   u i,j   (100)

Once the new radial position   r i,j   and flow velocity   u i,j   of information parcel   i   are determined, its specific enthalpy is readily given by Eq. (61) as  h i,j   =   h ∞ ,j   +   g i  r α/ 2  i,j  −   u 2  i,j  2   ,   (102) from which the local pressure and speed of sound can be computed using the employed EoS. As an alternative to integrating the velocity using Eq. (101), although not used for the results presented in Section IX, the flow velocity may also be determined explicitly using Eq. (69), such that  u i,j   =   α ϕ i  2   r 1+ α/ 2  i,j  +   g i  r α/ 2  i,j   ( c i,j   +   u i,j   )   ,   (103) with  ϕ i   =  2  α    R ( τ i ) 1+ α/ 2   ˙ R ( τ i )   −   R ( τ i )   g i  c L ( τ i ) +  ˙ R ( τ i )    (104) if sufficiently small flow velocities are expected. Ivany   44   proposed to solve the flow velocity and pres- sure along outgoing characteristics originating at the gas-liquid interface at selected time instances, after the solution   of   the   bubble   dynamics   had   been   fully   ob- tained.   Denner and Schenke   60   presented a Lagrangian wave tracking algorithm, whereby the flow field is solved together with the bubble dynamics and the informa- tion originating from the gas-liquid interface is tracked along outgoing characteristics.   To this end, Eqs. (100) and (101) are integrated together as a coupled system of ODEs by a conventional fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme, using the same time step   ∆ t j   as for the inte- gration of Eqs. (96) and (97) 196 .  C.   Shock fronts  Because   both   the   particle   velocity   and   the   speed of   sound   are   monotone-increasing   functions   of   the pressure 218,219 ,   the parts of an acoustic wave with a higher pressure propagate faster than the parts of the same wave with a lower pressure.   This pressure depen- dency of the propagation speed drives a progressive steep- ening of the emitted waves and, eventually, may lead to the formation of a shock front for waves with sufficiently large initial amplitude.   These cumulative nonlinear ef- fects may become dominant for   M kr   ≳   1 , where   k   is the wavenumber of the emitted wave, irrespective of the Mach number   M   ; 220   in the absence of dissipation, any plane wave forms a shock wave in finite time.   At the shock front, a frequency-dependent attenuation prevents fluid particles from overtaking the shock front 218   and, as postulated by Rudnick   221   , the stabilization of the shock front is independent of the origin of the acting dissipa- tion process, such as viscous stresses or thermal conduc- tion.   This can be observed in numerical simulations, where a stable shock front can form even in inviscid and non-conducting flows, if sufficient numerical dissipation is present 178,222,223 . When solving the flow field by propagating the rele- vant information along outgoing characteristics using a KBH model, the formation of a shock front is signified by the intersection of characteristics, as seen in Figure 4(a).   This intersection of characteristics yields a multi- valued solution, shown in Figure 4(b), that is not physi- cal. Akulichev   et al.   79   applied the   rule of equal areas 87  to post process the multivalued solutions resulting from intersecting characteristics. Taking a multivalued density profile as shown in Figure 4(b), the corresponding weak solution is obtained graphically by eliminating the mul- tivalued solution in such a way, that the area under the curve remains unchanged, as illustrated in Figure 4(c). Thus, the integral of the multivalued solution and the integral of the discontinuous weak solution of the density profile are the same, such that mass is conserved 224 . This implies that the wave on either side of the shock front remains a simple wave traveling in one direction, with- out reflections introduced at the discontinuity 220 .   This method has been used, for instance, in studies on laser- induced cavitation 58,59,61,123   and sonoluminescence 163   to model the formation and attenuation of shock waves us- ing the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. Utilizing the Lagrangian wave tracking algorithm men- tioned in the previous section, Denner and Schenke   60  proposed to simply discard any information that over- takes the information propagating ahead of it, as illus- trated in Figure 5, to account for the formation of shock fronts and the associated dissipation.   Naugol’nykh   220  described a similar procedure as “clipping of the vertices of its profile” when referring to the decay of plane saw- tooth waves.   This rather simple procedure aims to ex- ploit the argument of Rudnick   221   that the stabilization of the shock front is independent of the origin of dissi- pation. However, even though the results obtained with this method are in reasonably good agreement with the result obtained by applying the rule of equal areas for shock waves produced by collapsing bubbles 60 , discard- ing information by clipping the density profile does not redistribute mass.   Hence, this simple shock treatment yields an error in mass conservation and overpredicts the attenuation of the shock front, as observed in Figure 4(c).  IX.

However,   some   fundamental questions regarding the validity and applicability of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis remain.   To further scruti- nize and improve KBH models, this section focuses on the prediction of the propagation and attenuation of shock fronts at simulation run time (Section IX A) and the com- plex impedance of curved acoustic waves (Section IX B). The presented results were produced with version v1.6 of the open-source software library   APECSS 196 , available at  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10981878 .  A.   Predicting shock fronts at simulation run time  The robust and accurate treatment of multivalued so- lutions associated with shock fronts at simulation run time presents challenges.   Firstly, the full wave profile is required for an accurate treatment of a multivalued solution.   This can be addressed when solving the flow along the outgoing characteristics by reconstructing the pressure or density profile in space.   Secondly, however, i   + 2   i   + 1  i  i   −   1  ⇒  i   + 2  i  i   −   1  FIG. 6: Sketch of a discrete wave profile (left) with a multivalued solution and (right) after treating this multivalued solution by the proposed   averaging  procedure, Eqs. (105)-(107). the multivalued solution should also be appropriately re- solved in space.   Assuming that we follow the discrete pieces of information that originate at the gas-liquid in- terface along the outgoing characteristic, e.g. as described in Section VIII B, the spatial resolution of the wave pro- file is directly dependent on the time step applied to solve the bubble dynamics. While the application of the rule of equal areas pro- vides an accurate means to rectify multivalued solutions, it is usually applied as a post-processing step. The clip- ping method of Denner and Schenke   60   can treat mul- tivalued solutions at run time, but does not conserve mass and tends to overestimate the attenuation at shock fronts.   To remedy this shortcoming, a run-time shock treatment based on a simple averaging procedure of the multivalued solution is proposed, as illustrated in Figure 6. With the overtaking information parcel   i +1   tagged to be deleted, the location   r i   and invariant   g i   of information parcel   i   are redefined as  r i,j   =   r i +1 ,j   +   r i,j  2   (105)  g i   =   g i +1   +   g i  2   .

(109). The analytical solution for the amplitude of the decaying shock wave of Fay   218   , Eq. (108), is shown for reference. The average of the invariant   g   follows from the conser- vation of specific kinetic enthalpy and presumes that the applied time step is sufficiently small so that the invari- ant   g   varies linearly in the close vicinity of the shock front. This leaves the enthalpy   h i   and the velocity   u i   un- defined. Considering that the velocity has two solutions that satisfy a given   g , the robust choice is to average the velocity as  u i,j   =   u i +1 ,j   +   u i,j  2   .   (107) The   specific   enthalpy   h i   is   then   readily   defined   by Eq. (102).   Furthermore, preliminary tests showed that the choice of quantities that are averaged (i.e.,   g i   and   u i ,  h i   and   u i , or   ρ i   and   u i ) has a negligible impact on the results. After the quantities associated with information parcel   i   have been redefined, the overtaking information parcel   i   + 1   is discarded. As a first test case, we consider the shock formation of a planar wave emitted in an inviscid fluid by an os- cillating planar emitter ( α   = 0 ).   The oscillating emit- ter generates an harmonic acoustic wave that gradually steepens to eventually form a shock front, at which point it starts to develop into a sawtooth wave that decays due to the attenuation acting at the shock front.   For such a sawtooth wave, Fay   218   derived an analytical solution for the pressure amplitude   ∆ p , given in function of the one-dimensional coordinate   r   as  ∆ p ( r ) =   ±   πr sh  r   +   r sh  ∆ p a ,   (108) where the shock forming distance of a plane harmonic wave is 225  r sh   =   ρ 0 c 3 0  2 πβf a ∆ p a  ,   (109) where   f a   and   ∆ p a   are the initial frequency and pressure amplitude of the emitted acoustic wave.   The nonlin- earity coefficient   β   for an ideal gas or a Tait fluid is defined as 219,226   β   = ( γ   + 1) / 2 .   Note that the solu- tion of Fay, Eq. (108), is only applicable to “perfect” sawtooth waves 225   for   r   ≫   r sh   and that the excitation amplitude   ∆ p a   ought to be sufficiently small such that the nonlinear dependency of the fluid properties on the pressure (see Section IV) is negligible.   Figure 7 shows the results obtained using Eqs. (100)-(102) in conjunc- tion with the clipping-based shock treatment of Denner and Schenke   60   and the averaging-based shock treatment proposed above, for an initially harmonic wave in wa- ter modeled using the modified Tait EoS ( β   = 4 . 075 ). At  r   =   r sh   + R 0 , the wave profile forms vertical fronts, where  ∂p/∂r   → ∞ , as predicted by the theory of Blackstock   225   . Subsequently, the wave evolves into a fully developed sawtooth wave and starts to decay, with its amplitude asymptotically approaching the solution of Fay   218   . The clipping procedure of Denner and Schenke   60   , whereby a multivalued solution is treated by clipping the “overtak- ing” part of the wave profile, fails to predict this sawtooth wave correctly; only the wave peaks reduce, whereas the wave troughs remain unchanged.   This shortcoming is evidently less of an issue for the pressure pulses emit- ted by a strong bubble collapse for which the clipping procedure has previously been tested 60 .   The proposed averaging procedure is able to predict the decay of both the peaks and troughs of the sawtooth wave accurately. To assess the capabilities of the run-time shock treat- ment in a more representative scenario, the Rayleigh col- lapse of a spherical gas bubble ( α   = 2 ) in water is simu- lated. The bubble has an initial radius   R 0   and its collapse is driven by an initial gas pressure of   p G , 0   =   p ∞ / 1000  compared to a constant ambient pressure of   p ∞   = 10 5   Pa . The gas is modeled using the NA EoS, see Eqs. (59) and (60), with   ρ G , 0   = 1 . 2 kg / m 3   at   p ∞ ,   κ   = 1 . 4 , and  b   = 1 . 5 × 10 − 3   m 3 / kg , whereas water is modeled using the modified Tait EoS, with   n   = 7 . 15 ,   B   = 3 . 046   ×   10 8   Pa,  ρ 0   = 997   kg/m 3   at   p ∞ , and   μ   = 0 . 001 Pa s .   The sur- face tension of the gas-liquid interface is neglected. For validation purposes, the results obtained based on the

Results obtained with a Navier-Stokes solver are shown for reference. Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis are compared to a fully re- solved simulation using a state-of-the-art Navier-Stokes solver 46,52 . For this simulation, the pressure in the liquid is initialized as   p ( r ) =   p ∞   +   R 0 ( p G , 0   −   p ∞ ) /r , the bubble is resolved with   1000   mesh cells per initial bubble radius, and the time step applied at the time when the bubble reaches its minimum radius is   ∆ t   ≃   5   ×   10 − 8 t c , where  t c   ≃   0 . 915   R 0  p ρ ∞ /p ∞   is the Rayleigh collapse time 227 . Figure 8 shows a close agreement of the bubble radius and gas pressure obtained with the Navier-Stokes solver and with the Gilmore equation, Eq. (55). The temporal evo- lution of the pressure and velocity in the vicinity of the bubble is shown in Figure 9, at   r   =   { 0 . 2 ,   0 . 5 ,   1 } R 0 . The emitted acoustic wave forms a shock front, with a verti- cal left slope of the pressure and velocity profiles. Note that in the temporal-evolution plots shown in Figure 9, the left-hand side of the profile reaches the measurement location first. The results obtained with both methods to treat the shock front, either clipping the wave profile or applying the proposed averaging procedure, yield a good

However, clipping the wave profile over- predicts the attenuation of the shock front in the far field, which manifests in a smaller peak pressure and velocity at   r   =   R 0 . The strong collapse and shock formation of an argon bubble that produces sonoluminescence 163   and of a laser- induced bubble 59   have previously been studied with re- spect to the emission of shock waves using KBH models. In both studies 59,163 , the rule of equal areas was applied to rectify the multivalued solutions at the shock front. The sonoluminescence bubble considered by Holzfuss   163  has an initial radius of   R 0   = 5   μ m and is excited with a frequency of   f a   = 23 . 5   kHz and a pressure amplitude of  ∆ p a   = 145   kPa, whereas the laser-induced bubble studied by Liang   et al.   59   is generated by a laser pulse with   20   μ J energy and   265   fs duration, and reaches a maximum bub- ble radius of approximately   36   μ m. In both cases, water is modeled by the modified Tait EoS. The exact param- eters of these cases can be found in the respective pub- lications, or the recent work of Denner and Schenke   60   . For orientation, the radius   R , bubble wall Mach number  ˙ R/c L , and gas pressure   p G   of the sonoluminescence and laser-induced bubbles are shown as a function of time in Figures 10 and 12, respectively.   Note that the dis- continuous changes in gas pressure of the laser-induced bubble are intentional and account for the complex mass- transfer dynamics of this bubble, as proposed by Liang  et al.   59   . In Figure 11, the pressure and velocity ampli- tude of the acoustic wave emitted by the primary collapse of the sonoluminescence bubble are shown, where subtle differences can be observed dependent on the treatment of the developing shock front.   The proposed averaging procedure exhibits a tendency to larger pressure and ve- locity values compared to simply clipping the wave pro- file. Nevertheless, the results obtained with both meth- ods to treat the shock front at run time compare very well with the results of Holzfuss   163   .   The spatial pro- files of the acoustic wave produced by the collapse of the laser-induced bubble, see Figure 13, exhibit a com- parable trend: the proposed averaging procedure yields a faster shock front with larger pressure and velocity val- ues compared to both the results of Liang   et al.   59   and the results obtained by clipping the wave profile. The ob- served differences are confined to the immediate vicinity of the shock front and are largest in the region in which the shock dissipation is strongest.

Time   t 0   is the time at which the peak pressure is emitted.  B.   Complex impedance of curved acoustic waves  The   acoustic   impedance   experienced   by   a   curved acoustic wave is complex, see Eq. (37), and depends on the radius of curvature of the acoustic wave relative to its wavenumber.   Only for relatively short waves ( kr   ≫   1 ) does the simple definition   z   =   ρc   of the specific acoustic impedance hold in good approximation. As discussed in Section VI A, the explicit velocity ex- pression given by Eq. (69) is the sum of the displace- ment of the fluid by the moving gas-liquid interface and the acoustic particle velocity associated with the emit- ted acoustic wave.   According to Eq. (69), the acoustic particle velocity   u 1   is, thus, given as  u 1 ( r, t ) =     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   α/ 2   h L ( τ   )   −   h ∞ ( τ   )  c ( r, t ) +   u ( r, t )   .   (110) Applying the isentropic relation d h   =   d p/ρ   and assuming the acoustic wave has a small pressure amplitude, such that   u   ≪   c ,   ρ   =   ρ ( r, t ) =   ρ L ( τ   )   and   c   =   c ( r, t ) =   c L ( τ   ) , the velocity is  u 1 ( r, t ) =     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   α/ 2   p L ( τ   )   −   p ∞ ( τ   )  ρc   ,   (111) or, using the notation used in the acoustic expansions, with   p   =   p 0   +   p 1 ,  u 1 ( r, t ) =     R ( τ   )  r ( t )   α/ 2   p 1 ( τ   )  ρc   .   (112) This expression is evidently not dependent on the relative curvature of the emitted wave and, therefore, suggests that velocity expressions derived from the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis do not account for the complex acoustic impedance of curved waves. To test this, we consider a spherical emitter situated in water that oscillates and emits acoustic waves at angular frequency   ω a , chosen such that a specific dimensionless wavenumber   k a R 0   is obtained, with   k a   =   ω a /c .

The considered pressure amplitude   ∆ p a   is sufficiently small such that the pressure-dependency of the liquid density and speed of sound are negligible. At the emitter wall, pressure and velocity are, therefore, in phase and there is no relative velocity between the emit- ter wall and the fluid. The water surrounding the emitter is described using the modified Tait EoS, with   n   = 7 . 15 ,  B   = 3 . 046   ×   10 8   Pa, and   ρ 0   = 997   kg/m 3 .   Following Eq. (37), the analytical solutions for the acoustic pres- sure and particle velocity are given as 182  p 1 ( r, t ) =   R r   ∆ p a   cos    ω a t   −   π  2   −   k ( r   −   R )    (115)  u 1 ( r, t ) =   R r  ∆ p a  ρc   cos( θ )  cos    ω a t   −   π  2   −   k ( r   −   R )   −   θ    ,  (116) respectively, where the complex impedance manifests in the phase shift   θ   =   π/ 2   −   arctan( kr ) .

22 velocity is  u ( r, t ) =   R 2  r 2   ˙ R ( t )   −   R r  u 1 ( r, t ) +   u 1 ( r, t ) .   (117) Figure 14 shows the spatial profiles of the pressure and velocity generated by the spherical emitter ( α   = 2 ) for  k a R 0   ∈ { 0 . 01 ,   1 ,   100 } , predicted by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, using Eqs. (100)-(102).   For all three cases, the pressure predicted by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is in virtually perfect agreement with the analytical so- lution, Eq. (115). However, the velocity profile predicted by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis agrees with the an- alytical solution for a curved wave, Eq. (117), only for the case with   k a R 0   = 10 2 , i.e. for a short wave with  kr   ≫   1 .   As the dimensionless wavenumber decreases, i.e. longer waves, the accuracy of the velocity predicted by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis deteriorates near the emitter. Despite this shortcoming, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis predicts the velocity accurately after the wave has traveled for more than approximately one wavelength  λ a , which corresponds to   k a ( r   −   R 0 )   ≳   2 π .   We can, therefore, conclude that the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothe- sis does not account for the complex acoustic impedance of curved waves and, as a consequence, fails to predict the particle velocity of long waves ( kr   ≲   1 ) close to the emitter correctly.   In fact, the velocity ODE arising from the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, Eq. (101), predicts  u 1   ≃   p 1 / ( ρc )   for all three cases, as observed in Figure 14, irrespective of the dimensionless wavenumber   kr . Never- theless, the predictions provided by the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis are accurate for   r   ≳   R   +   λ a . Recent experimental and numerical studies that re- ported accurate predictions of KBH models stand in ap- parent contradiction to the shortcoming associated with the complex nature of the acoustic impedance.   For in- stance, the experimental measurements of the pressure and velocity of shock waves emitted by laser-induced cav- itation bubbles of Lai   et al.   58   and the fully resolved nu- merical results of the Rayleigh collapse of a spherical gas bubble shown in Figure 9 are in very good agreement with the corresponding predictions provided on the ba- sis of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. However, in these cases, which are representative for pressure-driven bub- ble dynamics, including underwater explosions as well as medical and sonochemical applications, the length of the emitted pressure pulse is short, with   kR   =   O (1)   or larger 58–61 .   In addition, the velocity very close to the bubble is dominated by the motion of the gas-liquid in- terface and even though the particle velocity is nominally large, it is typically less than   10%   of the total propaga- tion velocity   c   +   u .  X.   CONCLUSIONS  Originally developed to estimate the peak pressure of an underwater explosion at some distance, the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis has given rise to a collection of models that describe pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavita- tion and underwater explosions, as well as their acoustic emissions, with remarkable accuracy. By using standard numerical integration methods and modern computa- tional equipment, these models allow to predict complex processes of fluid dynamics and nonlinear acoustics, such as the laser-induced cavitation bubble discussed in Sec- tion IX A, in a fraction of a second. Here, the theoretical foundations of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and con- temporary models derived from it have been reviewed, as well as generalized from the typically considered spherical symmetry, to account for spherically symmetric, cylindri- cally symmetric, and planar one-dimensional domains. In addition, a new method to treat multivalued solutions associated with the formation of shock fronts at simula- tion run time has been proposed, which further improves the predictive capabilities of the models based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. Even though the Kirkwood- Bethe hypothesis fails to account for the curvature of acoustic waves, as they are, for instance, emitted by a bubble collapse, it has been shown to provide accurate predictions under the specific conditions associated with pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavitation and under- water explosions. Despite the extensive and formidable work achieved by the research community over more than eight decades, models based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis still lack some basic capabilities that can further extend their ap- plicability and improve their accuracy. For instance, al- though the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can produce ac- curate pressure and velocity predictions under realistic scenarios, it does not account for heat transfer.   As a first step, the recent combination of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis with the Noble-Abel stiffened-gas equation of state for bubble dynamics 90   and acoustic emissions 60  provides a consistent and accurate basis for predicting the temperature in the liquid surrounding a gas bubble or cavity.   While adiabatic temperature changes can be readily predicted in this way, thermal conduction and vis- cous heating, such as the heat introduced by the energy dissipation at a shock front 59 , are not accounted for. In this respect, medical ultrasound stands out as a field that requires high-fidelity temperature predictions if compu- tational tools are to play a more prominent role in the design of new treatments, since temperature changes of only   1   K can be safety relevant 228 . More generally, bub- bles are neither stationary nor do they appear in isolation or in a liquid of quasi-infinite extent in most engineering applications, which contradicts some of the main assump- tions underpinning the available models based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis. Recent advances for meth- ods developed based on the (quasi-)acoustic assumption point to possible solutions that may be incorporated into models based on the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis, to ac- count for the forces on bubbles as they move through a liquid 186 , the acoustic interaction of multiple bubbles 229 , and the influence of confinement and nearby walls 230 .
