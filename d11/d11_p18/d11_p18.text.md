Emergence of broadband Rayleigh waves from correlations of the ambient seismic noise  N. M. Shapiro   1   and M. Campillo 2 Received 14 January 2004; revised 25 February 2004; accepted 10 March 2004; published 8 April 2004. [   1   ]   We demonstrate that the coherent information about the   Earth   structure   can   be   extracted   from   the   ambient seismic noise. We compute cross-correlations of vertical component records of several days of seismic noise at different pairs of stations separated by distances from about one   hundred   to   more   than   two   thousand   kilometers. Coherent broadband dispersive wavetrains clearly emerge with group velocities similar to those predicted from the global Rayleigh-wave tomographic maps that have been constrained using ballistic surface waves. Those results show that coherent Rayleigh waves can be extracted from the   ambient   seismic   noise   and   that   their   dispersion characteristics   can   be   measured   in   a   broad   range   of periods. This provides a source for new types of surface- wave measurements that can be obtained for numerous paths that could not be sampled with the ballistic waves and, therefore,   can   significantly   improve   the   resolution   of seismic images.

Introduction  [   2   ]   Seismic imaging has been traditionally based on direct waves that are emitted by seismic sources such as explosions or earthquakes. Those ballistic waves have been used to measure travel times of the body waves, dispersion curves of the surface waves and frequencies of the Earth’s normal modes. Inversion of those measurements provided a fundamental information about the Earth’s interior and allowed to understand the Earth’s structure both in terms of its spherically symmetric stratification and in terms of three-dimensional and anisotropic variations of seismic properties. [   3 ]   Further increasing of the resolution of seismic images is mostly limited by the inhomogeneous distribution of seismic sources and receivers that still impose some funda- mental limitations on the resolution of seismic measure- ments from the ballistic waves. In this paper we concentrate on seismic surface-waves that are one of main sources of information about the structure of the Earth’s crust and upper mantle. Measurements made from direct surface waves have several limitations. First, the direct surface waves mostly sample only a few preferential directions while   many   other   directions   of   propagation   remain unsampled. Second, inversions of the ballistic surface waves require some information about the source that is not always known with a sufficient accuracy. Third, the measurements made with the teleseismic surface waves provide averages values over extended areas [e.g.,   Nolet and Dahlen , 2000;   Spetzler et al. , 2002] that limits the resolution of resulting seismic images. Fourth, it is difficult to make short-period measurements from teleseismic sur- face-waves because the heterogeneity results in the simul- taneous arrivals of waves with different paths.  2.   Cross-Correlations of Random Wavefields  [   4   ]   Recent developments in acoustics [e.g.,   Weaver and Lobkis , 2001a, 2001b;   Derode et al. , 2003] and seismology [ Campillo and Paul , 2003] suggest an alternative method to measure the elastic response of the Earth by extracting the Green function from the diffuse or random wavefields. Contrary to ballistic waves, fully diffuse wavefields are composed of waves with random amplitudes and phases but propagating in all possible directions and, therefore, contain the information about any possible path that can be extracted by computing cross-correlations between pairs of receivers. A simple demonstration of this property is based on a modal representation of a diffuse wavefield inside an elastic body (the Earth in our case) [ Weaver and Lobkis , 2001b]:  f ð x ;   t Þ ¼   X  n a   n   u n ð x Þ e i w n   t   ð 1 Þ  where   x   is position,   t   is time,   u   n   and   w n   are eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the real Earth, and   a   n   are modal excitation functions. An important property of the diffuse field is that the modal amplitudes are uncorrelated random variables:  a n   a m * h   i ¼   d nm   F   w n ð   Þ   ð 2 Þ  where   F ( w ) is the spectral energy density. Because the cross-terms disappear in average due to equation (2), the correlation between the fields at locations   x   and   y   becomes simply:  C ð x ;   y ;   t Þ ¼   X  n F   w n ð   Þ u n ð x Þ u n ð y Þ e  i w n   t   ð 3 Þ  GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 31, L07614, doi:10.1029/2004GL019491, 2004 1   Center   for   Imaging   the   Earth’s   Interior,   Department   of   Physics, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, Colorado, USA. 2   Laboratoire de Ge ´ophysique Interne et Tectonophysique, Observatoire de Grenoble, Universite ´ Joseph Fourier & CNRS, Grenoble, France.

The expression equation (3) differs only by an amplitude factor   F   from an actual Green function between points   x   and  y . This result reminds of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [ van Tiggelen , 2003]. Its very important implication is that the Green function between two locations (or at least, the arrival times of the different wave-trains) can be extracted from the diffuse field with a simple field-to-field correlation taken over sufficiently long time. [   5 ]   Extraction of the Green functions from the diffuse wavefield has been successfully applied in helioseismol- ogy [e.g.,   Duvall et al. , 1993;   Kosovichev et al. , 2000;  Rickett and Claerbaut , 2000], in ultrasonics [e.g.,   Weaver and Lobkis , 2001a, 2001b;   Derode et al. , 2003], and in marine acoustics [ Roux et al. , 2003]. In seismology, much attention   has   been   payed   to   the   seismic   coda   that   is created as a result of multiple scattering on the small- scale   heterogeneities   within   the   Earth   [e.g.,   Aki   and Chouet , 1975]. Traditionally, it has been used to extract average statistical properties of the Earth either by inter- pretations of the envelopes of seismograms based on the radiative   transfer   theory   [e.g.,   Abubakirov   and   Gusev , 1990;   Hoshiba ,   1991;   Ryzhik   et   al. ,   1996;   Sato   and Fehler , 1998;   Margerin et al. , 1999] or by the coda-wave interferometry [e.g.,   Cowan et al. , 2002;   Snieder et al. , 2002]. The diffuse character of the seismic coda has been explored by [ Hennino et al. , 2001] by investigating the property of mode equipartition [ Weaver , 1982] through the observation   of   the   stabilization   of   the   ratio   of   S-   and P-wave   energies   in   the   coda   of   Mexican   earthquakes. Recently, the deterministic surface-wave Green functions has been extracted by the correlation of records of seismic coda of regional earthquakes in Mexico by   Campillo and Paul   [2003].  3.   Application to the Ambient Seismic Noise  [   6   ]   Here, we report results of application of the field-to- field correlation technique to records of the ambient seismic noise that is exited by shallow sources such as ocean microseisms [e.g.,   Friedrich et al. , 1998] and atmospheric perturbations [e.g.,   Lognonne et al. , 1998;   Tanimoto , 1999]. When taken over long times, the distribution of the ambient sources randomizes and the seismic noise can be considered as a random field satisfying equations (1) and (2). There- fore, even if this randomizing mechanism is different from the multiple scattering that randomizes the seismic coda, we can still expect that the deterministic Green functions can be extracted from the ambient seismic noise. Moreover, using the noise instead of the coda has the very significant advantage that the noise does not depend on the earthquake occurrence and can be recorded in any location almost continuously. [   7   ]   To test if the Green functions can be extracted from the ambient seismic noise, we selected a relatively quiescent period (01/01/2002-02/08/2002) during which there was no large earthquake (M      7) in the world and downloaded all available continuous vertical component records at stations ANMO and CCM (Figure 1a) and used them to compute cross-correlations in different period bands. Because the amplitude of the ambient seismic noise can vary by a few orders of magnitude, a simple cross-correlation between noise records at two stations would strongly overweight the most energetic parts of the noise. Therefore, we disregarded the amplitude completely by considering only one-bit signals [ Campillo and Paul , 2003]. Figure 1b shows that coherent wavetrains emerge at all periods. Moreover, the emerging signal is dispersive as expected for Rayleigh waves inside the Earth, i.e., the long periods arrive before the short periods. To compare the dispersion characteristics of the emerging signal with those that can be measured for the same path from ballistic waves we computed a broad- band (0.008 –0.07 Hz) cross-correlation and applied to it a frequency-time analysis of   Levshin et al.   [1989] to measure its group-velocity dispersion curve. The result of this analysis between stations ANMO and CCM is shown in Figure 2b and is compared with the dispersion curve predicted by ray-tracing through the global group velocity maps of   Ritzwoller et al.   [2002] constructed from ballistic waves. The agreement between results obtained with the cross-correlation of the noise records and from the ballistic waves is remarkable, especially at periods below 60 s. We applied the same analysis to two other pairs of stations located in US (Figures 2c – 2d). For the path between stations CMB and TUC that crosses tectonically active provinces of the Western US we measure relatively slow group velocities while for the path between CCM and HRV lying within the stable platform we obtain high group velocities similar to predictions from the ballistic waves. We also computed the cross-correlation at two stations located in the North Western Pacific (Figures 2e–2f ). Here, we also make a comparison with group velocities measured from a local earthquake occurred in vicinity of one of  Figure 1.   (a) Map showing the station location.

stations (PET) and recorded by the other station (MAJO). All three measurements agree very well at periods smaller than 50 s. Computation of cross-correlations at more regional scale is presented in Figure 3 that shows results obtained in Southern California using records of TERRAscope stations. It can be seen that, at distances of a few hundreds of kilometers, short period Rayleigh waves emerge very clearly from the noise. At longer distances, the short-period signal can be obscured by strong attenuation. Making dispersion measurements at short period is very important to obtain better estimations of the crustal structure and to improve the vertical resolution of the seismic tomographic models [e.g.,  Shapiro and Ritzwoller , 2002].  4.   Discussion  [   8 ]   Our examples clearly demonstrate that fundamental- mode Rayleigh wave emerges from the correlations of the ambient seismic noise. This suggests a possibility to mea- sure broadband Rayleigh wave dispersion curves between any desired pair of seismic stations. Development of meth- ods that will explore this possibility is a topic for future research that, as we hope, can be stimulated by this paper. Estimating the accuracy of the measurements made from the seismic noise will be critical for the success of those methods. [   9   ]   Surface-wave measurements made from the seismic noise can be specially advantageous with dense arrays of seismometers when they can be made for many paths and directions that cannot be sampled with the ballistic waves. Moreover the measurements made from the noise has significant advantages relative to measurements obtained with the direct waves. First, those measurements can be done for any direction of propagation. Second, they do not depend on the source location and phase (equation (3)). Third, the sensitivity zone of those measurements is local-  Figure 2.

For each pair of stations, the upper frame show the cross- correlation that has been high-passe filtered at 0.05 Hz to emphasize the long-period part of the emerging signal. The lower frame shows the comparison of a period group-velocity diagram computed from this cross-correlation with a dispersion curve (solid black line) predicted for the corresponding inter-station path from global Rayleigh-wave group velocity tomographic maps of [ Ritzwoller et al. , 2002] computed from the ballistic surface waves. For each pair of stations, we indicate the inter-station distance and the total duration of the noise records available. For the path PET-MAJO, we also compare the period- group velocity diagram computed from the cross-correlation with the group-velocity dispersion curve (dotted white line) measured from an earthquake located near the coast of Kamchatka (1995/04/01, 05:50:18, 52.26N, 159.04E) and recorded at MAJO.

ized in a narrow region connecting two stations. Fourth, the measurements can be extended to short periods if relatively closely located stations are available. As a consequence, the new measurement techniques can help to improve both the horizontal and the vertical resolution of the seismic tomo- graphic models. [   10   ]   Acknowledgments.
