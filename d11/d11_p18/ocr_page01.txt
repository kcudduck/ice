[1] We demonstrate that the coherent information about information about the structure of the Earth’s crust and
the Earth structure can be extracted from the ambient upper mantle. Measurements made from direct surface
seismic noise. We compute cross-correlations of vertical waves have several limitations. First, the direct surface
