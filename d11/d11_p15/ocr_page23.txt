for some C' > 0. Choosing T" = 2C' and replacing the “damping” term using identity (4.5) (with
f = 0) we rewrite the above estimate as follows
T
Ei(T) + / Ei(t)dt < Cr|E1(0) — EL (T))
0
which implies
Cr
F(T) < ——F1(0) = nF; (0),
(1) < TB 0) = pF (0)
where 0 < pu < 1 does not depend on the solution. This implies (4.40) with w = |Inu|/T and
M =1/p. []
The result of Theorem 4.7 is the key to establish the exponential stability of of the semigroup
S(t), generated by A on HI.
4.2 Proof of Theorem 2.2
Part (i). Notice that the exponential decay for FE; obtained in Theorem (4.7) implies exponential
decay of the quantities ||z||p(a1/2), [|2¢||2(n), and we will show that this implies exponential decay for
the total energy F(t), provided that the initial data ug is controlled with respecyt to the topology
induced by A'/2. For this, the only remaining quantity we need to show exponential decay is |u| parr
and this follows from the fact that bu; + c*u = 2. Indeed, the variation of parameters formula implies
that

then, computing the D(A'2?)-norm both sides we estimate

The proof is complete. []
Part (ii). The first step towards showing H;—level stabilization is to derive energy estimate for the
higher order energy functional Ey. We start with a basic multiplier identity.
