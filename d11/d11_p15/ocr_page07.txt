the following theorem we show existence of H;—valued solutions given Hl; initial data which are small
in H only. The proof, given in Section 5, relies on estimates derived via interpolation inequalities
which allows to demonstrate certain “invariance” of a H-small ball under the nonlinear dynamics in
Hi; .

We start specifying the notion of solution for the semilinear problem (1.1) supplemented with

(1.4) and (2.1). We denote the initial data here by ®q = (ug, u1, us)". Given T > 0, we say that
O(t) = (u(t), u(t), un(t))

is a mild solution for the system (1.1), (1.4) and (2.1) provided ® € C(|0,T],H;) and

t

Before stating the theorem, we denote by HP” (for p > 0) the set
HP == {® € Hy; ||P||m < p}.

Theorem 2.3 (Global Solutions). Let Assumption 1 on I'y be in force. Then, there exists p > 0
sufficiently small such that, given any ®q € HP the formula (2.11) defines a continuous Hy —valued mild
solution for the system (1.1), (1.4) and (2.1). Moreover, for such p > 0, there exists R = R(||Po||m,)
such that all trajectories starting in By (0, R)' remain in By. (0, Ry) for all t > 0, Ry > R.

Once global solutions are shown to exist, we take on the issue of asymptotic (in time) stability.
The final result is positive, as we expected, and holds uniformly (w.r.t +) as long as v € L*°({2) and
v(x) = 0 a.e. in .

Theorem 2.4 (Nonlinear Uniform Stability). Let Assumption 1 on I'g be in force and assume
v € LQ) and v(x) = 0. Then, there exists p > 0 sufficiently small and M(p),w > 0 such that if
db, € HP then

2) lm, < M(p)e "(| Pollm,,  t=0 (2.12)
where © 1s the mild solution given by Theorem 2.5.

We notice that repeating the statement there exists p > 0 such that if og € H” in the Theorem
above is not redundant. In fact, one might need to require even smaller initial data to yield expo-
nential decay. This again highlights the advantage of requiring smallness only in H. For more details,
see pection 0.

2.3 Discussion
The main novelty of this paper is that we study stabilizability of a nonlinear critical IMGT equation
with Neumann—Robin undissipated portion of the boundary. Should the problem be subcritical (i.e.
v(x) > v9 > 0 for x € Q, the difficulty created by the failure of Lopatinski condition would not enter
The HP-ball centered at the origin and with radius R.
