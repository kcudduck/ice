Proof. We need to estimate all the terms in (4.22). We immediately notice that the first boundary
term contains |z|* — |V,z|? evaluated on the boundary. However, on Ij we have no information on
either tangential derivative — which provides contribution unbounded with respect to the energy level.
And it is at this point where we will be using orthogonality of the constructed vector field A with
respect to normal to the boundary direction. The details are given below.

We start with the last term in (4.22) . Notice that

due to trace inequality. Next, we notice that

due to h-v =0 on I'y and the definition of the damping term (4.6).
Remark 4.3. Notice that assuming only Ah -v <0, would allow to dispense with the term

However, the gradient term

where 0, indicates derivative in the tangential direction, poses difficulties. Boundary condition on I,
provide good estimate for the first part. However, for the second no estimate is available unless zr,
is under control, which is given through the dissipation or h-v = 0.

Back to (4.25), for I'y a tangential-trace estimate is available. In fact, using an adaptation
of Lemma 2.1 in [28], which was obtained via microlocal analysis of the homogeneous case, and
accounting for our non—homogeneity —vyu; + f in (4.1) we obtain
