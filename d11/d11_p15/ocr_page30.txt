Proof of Theorem 6.1. We use the same constants as in (5.6), that is, we use that
TO) cy < Mie (6.5)
for all t. Moreover, we know that the solution ® exists in some X” for #8 > 0 small and that the
whole argument of the proof for the existence of global solution would still be true if one decreased
3. Therefore, by possibly taking it smaller, we assume
TW

5 = 6(r) < or 6.6
where wy; = wq(7) is the rate of exponential decay of the semigroup T(t) in Hj; for a fixed 7 > 0. As
in the proof of global wellposedness, we take p = pz. We then compute, via (6.5) and (5.2)

Corollary 6.3. With reference to Section 5, let By be the largest number such that the map © has
a fized point in XP which is, moreover, uniformly exponentially stable as in Theorem 2./. Let
w : (0, 80] — Ry be the function that maps each B > 0 to the decay rate w(B). Then there exists
another function w : (0, Bo] = Ry such that w(B) = w(B) for all feasible 5 and
lim w(f) = wy, (6.8)
B8—0
where wy is the decay rate of the linear semigroup T(t).
