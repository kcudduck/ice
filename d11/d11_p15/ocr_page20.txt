Finally, Lemma 4.4 yields Proposition 4.3 after taking small enough. []
Our next result aims at improving Lemma 4.3 by absorbing lots(z) by the damping. For the linear
problem the compactness uniqueness argument used for achieving it is stated below.
Proposition 4.5. For T' > 0 there exists a constant Ct > 0 such that the following inequality holds:
T
lots(z) < cr | Dy(s)ds (4.32)
0
Proof. As pointed out in the statement of Proposition (4.3), we have
lots(2) < Cs sup {12]31s() + 1263-50) |
t€[0,T]
for 6 € (0,1/2). Then we prove Proposition (4.5) as a corollary of the following Lemma
Lemma 4.6. There exists a constant Cr such that
T
|(2, 20) | 720,755 (0) x F-5 ()) S cr | Dy(s)ds (4.33)
Proof. The proof is based on compactness-uniqueness argument. Compactness follows from compact-
ness of Sobolev’s embeddings implicated in the definition of of lower order terms with respect to
the finite energy space for variables (z,z) which are H*(Q) x Ly(€Q). Uniqueness, instead follows
from the overdetermination of the wawe equation with overdetermined Neuman-Dirichlet data on the
boundary I';. Using the notation of [41], let X = HY(Q), B= H'™°(Q) and Y = H°(Q). Then it
follows from |35, Theorem 16.1| that the injection of X in B is compact. Moreover, since § € (0,1/2),
135, Theorem 12.4| allows us to write
Y = H~°(Q) — [L*(2), H=(Q)]s,
and then the injection of B in Y is continuous (even dense). Introduce the space A as
A={ve L*0,T;X);vc L*(0,T;Y)}
equipped with the norm
lola = llvll2,rx) + [01 220,15)
Then it follows from [41] that the injection of W into L*(0,T; B) is compact. We are then ready for
proving (4.33)
By contradiction, suppose that there exists a sequence of initial data {ug,, u1,, us, } With corre-
sponding FET (0) energy uniformly (in n) bounded generating a sequence {u,,t,,i,} of solutions of
