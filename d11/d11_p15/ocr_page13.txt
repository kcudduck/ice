The energy for a solution ® = (u, us, uy) € D(A) will be computed in two levels. We define the
lower energy functional F(t) = Ey(t) + E1(t) where

and the higher energy functional £(t) = E(t) + E5(t) where

where a and v may depend on x. We also note that

. By Poincare- Wirtenberg inequality we obtain that

It is standard to see that E(t) ~ ||®(¢)]|%, see |5] for details. The following lemma follows from
classic elliptic theory and provides the estimate which is necessary for justifying our choice of higher
energy functional. As a remark, here and hereafter we use the notation a < b to say that a < Cb
where C' is a constant possibly depending on the physical parameters of the model (7,¢,b > 0) but
independent of space, time and vy € L*>(€2).

4.1 Propagation of boundary dissipation — Flow multipliers
We begin with energy identity for F;. Since the problem is linear we work with smooth solutions (in
the domain of the generator) which can be extended by density to the phase space solutions.
Proposition 4.2 (Energy Identity). Let T'> 0. If ¥ = (u, z, 2;) is a weak solution of (4.1) then
