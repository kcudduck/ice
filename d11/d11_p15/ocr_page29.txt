Notice that exponential stability of the linear problem in H and Hj; allows we to obtain the
estimates (5.7), (5.8) and (5.10) with right hand side time-independent. This allows us to take
T = oo is all of them and repeat the same construction to obtain a fixed—point of © defined in the
whole RR...

This completes the proof of theorem 2.3 by taking p = pgs.

6 Proof of Theorem 2.4-Uniform Nonlinear Stability
In this section we show that one can easily show that the solution of the nonlinear problem decay
exponentially to zero as t — oo by taking advantage of three facts established in this paper.
(i) The fact that the solution is a fixed point of the map © defined in (5.5), and therefore can be
implicitly represented as
t
S(t) =T(t)Dy + / T(t —o)F(®)(o)do (6.1)
0
(ii) The fact that our existence of global solution result requires smallness of initial data only in the
a lower topology and the use of this along with interpolation inequalities allowed us to obtain
the key estimate (5.2).
(ii) The fact that the semigroup 7'(¢) in (6.1) is uniformly exponentially stable in both H and Hj.

The final result of this section is the following.

Theorem 6.1. There exists p > 0 such that the solution ® constructed in (2.3) is such that

|B (ts, < 2Mye™ "(| Do |s, (6.2)
for all t > 0, where My,w; are the constants involved in the uniform stability of the linear semigroup
T(t).

The proof of this result relies heavily on the facts (i)—(ii) outlined above and a Grownwall type
inequality. This inequality seems to have been originally introduced in |1|, but here we are using |2,
Corollary 1, p. 389]. We state the inequality here for convenience, but in a version which is suitable
for our use in what follows. We invite the reader to consult |1, 2| and references therein for more
