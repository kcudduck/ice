the picture. Simply because there will be no need to propagate stability from the boundary into
the interior. As already mentioned before, linear dynamics with absorbing boundary conditions on
['y and zero Dirichlet data on I'g subject to star-shaped conditions has been considered in [5, 7].
Mathematical difficulties in propagating stability through the undissipated part of the boundary are
not present in this case. In order to cope with the difficulties we shall employ geometric constructs
developed earlier in [32]. These allow to construct suitable-non-radial—vector fields which result from
tangential bending of radial and star-shaped ones. These newly constructed fields propagate the
needed estimates through un—dissipated part of the boundary.

In order to treat the nonlinear problem, the approach used in the past (for subcritical case) was
to use the so called “barrier’s method” based on contradiction argument. However, this presents
several technical difficulties in the present scenario, even at the level of low frequencies (lower order
terms). Hence, in this paper, we exploit another technique which, to the best of our knowledge, is
new and makes a strong use of the fact that we only require initial data to be small in H. One of the
advantages of such construction (for JMGT) was already exploited by the authors in [4] in allowing
extension by density in the nonlinear environment. In this paper we discovered that it also allows to:

a) prove global existence and exponential stability by the representation of the solution and two-
level stability of linear flows. Here, the smallness interplay comes to the picture through a
nonlinear propagation of the estimate of the type

|F(P) lez, < Col] Per) C2 Pe, -) (2.13)
where the size of C'(||®||g) can be controlled by p. See Theorem 2.3.

b) obtain, to some extent, a continuity property of the decay rate with respect to the H-size of
the initial data and the decay rate of the linear flow, w;. In general, we prove that if is the
H-size of the initial data and w(e) is the corresponding decay rate, then there exists w(e) such
that w(e) > w(e) and w(e) = wy as €¢ = 07.

The rest of this paper is devoted to the proofs.

3 Linear Semigroups — Proof of Theorem 2.1

We notice that H has its topology induced by the inner product

We first show that A: D(A) C H — H generates a Cy semigroup on H. This part of the argument
follows essentially |7| with some rather straigthforward modifications. We shall outline the main
details — as these are needed for the proof of generation on the higher level of H; topology.
