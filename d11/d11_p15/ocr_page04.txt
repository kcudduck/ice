2 Main Results and Discussion.

We consider the system comprised of (1.1), boundary conditions (1.4) and initial conditions
u(0, +) = ug, ut (0) = uy, ug (0, +) = us (2.1)
with regularity to be specified in what follows.

Here and throughout the paper, by L?(Q)) and L*(I') we denote the sets of measurable (in the
Lebesgue and Hausdorff senses, respectively) functions whose squares are integrable on 2 and I’
respectively equipped with the norms induced by the inner products

(u,v) = / wud? and (u,v)r = [ vir
0 r
and denoted respectively by ||-||2 and || ||[r. The remaining LP(2)—spaces (1 <p < oo) will also have
their norms denoted by || -[|,. Additionally, by H*(£2) we denote the (L*-based) Sobolev space of
order s and define the particular spaces H{ (2) and HZ(Q) as
HQ) = {ue H(Q); ulr=0} and HE(Q) = H*(Q) N HQ)

in order to avoid confusion with the standard Hj; ().
2.1 Functional Analytic Setting.
Let A: D(A) C L*(Q) — L*(Q2) be the operator defined as

AE = —AE, D(A) = {£ € HQ); B€lr, = 0,046 + rol, = 0}. 22)
In this setting, A is a positive, self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent and for ro > 0, D (AY?) =
H'(Q) with the — equivalent to H'(Q)) — topology of D(A?) given by

fully = [Val + | wofufdTo
0
In addition, with some abuse of notation we (also) denote by A: L*(Q) — [D(A)]|' the extension (by
duality) of the operator A.
Let us introduce the phase space H given by
H := D(AY?) x D(AY?) x L*(Q) ~ HY(Q) x HY(Q) x L*(Q). (2.3)
Next, we rewrite (1.1) along with (1.4) and (2.1) as a first-order abstract system on H. For this,
we introduce the classic boundary — interior harmonic extension for the Neumann data on I'; as
