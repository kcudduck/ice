For notational convenience and future use, we introduce the following change of variables bz =
bu, + c*u which reduces the problem to a PDE-abstract ODE coupled system. The change from the
coordinates (u, ug, uy) to (u, z, z¢) is described through the isomophism M € L(H) given by (see |36])

The next lemma makes the above topological statement precise.
Lemma 3.1. Assume that the compatibility conditions
AO, Ug + Koug = 0 on Ty, Jug + ku; = 0 on I'y (3.2)
hold. Then ® € C*(0,T;H)NC(0,T;D(A)) is a strong solution of

Proof. We only check the matching of the boundary conditions. Assume that ¥ = (u,z, 2) €
CY0,T;H)NC(0,T;D(A)) is a strong solution for (3.4). Let
T(t) := (AO u(t) + rou(t))|r,, t= 0
and notice that bY; + ¢*Y = 0 for all ¢. This along with the compatibility condition (3.2); (T(0) = 0)
implies that T = 0. The same argument mutatis mutandis recovers the boundary condition for u on
I. []
For convenience, we explicitly write a formula for the new operator A = MAM~!. We have
