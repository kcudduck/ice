where K, : L*(Q) — L?(Q) acts on an element £ € L*(Q) as
Ki = [(s"+8)A™ + b(I + sN(kiN*A)] &.
We now notice the restriction Kj |p 41/2 is strictly positive. Indeed it follows by (2.5) that, given
¢ € D(AY?) we have
(K€ E)pavzy = (5° + s)[[€]I5 + DIIAYZE][3 + bs(AV2N (ki N*A)E, AV2E)
= (5° + s)[|€]13 + bl AVZE3 + bs] RINT AE[I7, > 0.
Therefore Ks pai c L(D(AY?)) and since sA™'h — bg € D(AY?) we have that
& = K;'(sA™'h — bg) € D(A?)
is the solution of (3.9). Finally,
&=s'(& +g) e DAY).
For the final step to conclude membership of (&1,&,&3) in D(A) we look at the abstract version
of the description of D(A):
D(A) = {(&1, 2,8) €H; & + N(kiN*A&s) € D(A) }
whereby one only needs to check that & + N(kiN*A&) € D(A) since the regularity for the triple
(£1,&9,&3)" to belong to Hl was already established. The desired regularity will follow from (3.8),
which implies
bs(&o + N(rk1N*AE)) — —(s° + s) ATES + sA th - D(A),
since &3,h € L*(9).

This proves that A; is maximal dissipative, therefore generates a Cy—semigroup of contractions
due to Lummer Phillips Theorem and, since P is bounded, A = A; + P generates a Cy—semigroup on
HL.

For generation in H; we use an argument inspired by the one presented in ([36], p. 26) with the
needed modifications. Since we already know that A generates a Cy semigroup {S(¢)}>0 on a larger
space H, we only show that

{T(1) Fe=0 := 15(0)|m, Feo
is also a semigroup and that its infinitesimal generator is A when considered as an operator in Hj.

This entails the proof of two things: {7'()};>0 satisfies the semigroup property — which follows
from the fact that the problem is autonomous — and invariance: T'(t)(H;) C H; for all £ > 0.

If ® = (ug,ui,us)’ € H; then dug + kiuy = 0 on I'j. We then need to show that this
condition is invariant under the dynamics and, in addition, the regularity Au € C([0,T); L*(Q))
holds true. This along with the boundary conditions and regularity of elliptic problems will prove
that uw € C(]0,T); H*(?)). In order to show that Au € C ([0,T); L*(Q2)), we appeal to the change of
variables bz; = bu; + c*u. By the variation of parameters formula we have
