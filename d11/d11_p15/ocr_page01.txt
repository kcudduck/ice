— Abstract
> Boundary feedback stabilization of a critical, nonlinear Jordan—Moore—Gibson—Thompson
f= (JMGT) equation is considered. JMGT arises in modeling of acoustic waves involved in medi-
= cal engineering treatments like lithotripsy, thermotherapy, sonochemistry, or any other procedures
- using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). It is a well-established and recently widely stud-
— ied model for nonlinear acoustics (NLA): a third-order (in time) semilinear Partial Differential
rs Equation (PDE) with the distinctive feature of predicting the propagation of ultrasound waves
‘@\ at finite speed due to heat phenomenon know as second sound which leads to the hyperbolic
= character of heat propagation. In practice, the JMGT dynamics is largely used for modeling the
uo evolution of the acoustic velocity and, most importantly, the acoustic pressure as sound waves
~ propagate through certain media. In this work, critical refers to (usual) case where media—
— damping effects are non—existent or non—measurable and therefore cannot be relied upon for
=~ stabilization purposes.
> In this paper the issue of boundary stabilizability of originally unstable (JMGT) equation is
Ne resolved. Motivated by modeling aspects in HIFU technology, boundary feedback is supported
= only on a portion of the boundary, while the remaining part of the boundary is left free (available
to control actions) . Since the boundary conditions imposed on the "free" part of the boundary
fail to satisfy Lopatinski condition (unlike Dirichlet boundary conditions), the analysis of uniform
stabilization from the boundary becomes very subtle and requires careful geometric considerations.

1 Introduction
1.1 PDE Model and an Overview
Let Q C R? (d = 2,3) denote a bounded domain with sufficiently smooth boundary I" := 9 within
which a sound wave propagates. In HIFU technology, as well as in other contexts, one is interested
