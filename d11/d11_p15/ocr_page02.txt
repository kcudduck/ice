in tracking — and often controlling — the evolution of the acoustic pressure u = u(t, x) (t € Ry, x € Q)
caused by such wave propagation. In media on which heat propagates hyperbolically (which is the
case of most biological tissues), the evolution of the acoustic pressure can be assumed to obey the
semilinear JMGT—equation which is given by the third order in time abstract evolution equation

TU + (00 — 2kw)uy — Au — (6 + 76?) Auy = 2ku, (1.1)
where c,0,k > 0 are constants representing the speed and diffusivity of sound and a nonlinearity
parameter, respectively, while the function a : Q — RT accounts for natural frictional damping
provided by the media. The parameter 7 > 0 — also media—dependent — accounts for thermal
relaxation and essentially transfers the hyperbolicity of the heat to the acoustic wave.

The semilinear equation (1.1) can be viewed as a singular perturbation and, to some extent, a
refinement of the classical quasilinear Westervelt’s equation

(0 — 2ku) uy — > Au — §Au, = 2ku; | (1.2)
obtained by setting 7 = 0. Physically, the main difference between (1.1) and (1.2) is that the latter
predicts that these waves propagate at a finite speed. From the modeling point of view this results
from using Maxwell-Cattaneo Law — rather than Fourrier’s Law — to model a heat flux for acoustic
heat waves. The parameter 7 > 0 corresponds to time relaxation. For more about the physical
interpretation of (1.1), its derivation and overall discussion see |6, 19, 10, 11, 42, 13, 20]. This also
includes an analysis of asymptotic behavior of solutions when the parameter of relaxation tends to
zero [26, 27, 4, 3]

The issues of wellposedness and stability of solutions under homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary data were first addressed for both nonlinear and linearized (k = 0) dynamics around 2010
with the works of I. Lasiecka, R. Triggiani and B. Kaltenbacher [23, 24, 36, 25|. For the analysis of
the long-time dynamics of (1.1) for both linear and nonlinear cases, the function

7:0 = R, v(x) = ax) — re (1.3)
plays a central role. In fact, the existence of a positive constant vy such that v(x) > vy > 0 a.e. in Q
ensures both that linear dynamics is uniformly exponentially stable and that stable nonlinear flows
can be constructed via “barriers” [25] method. A natural question, in light of the above results, is
concerning the other profiles of +. It is known that if + < 0 one may have chaotic solutions [14| and if
v = 0 then the energy is conserved |24, 23|. This raises the interesting question of what mechanisms
could be employed to ensure stability of the dynamics when + degenerates, i.e., v(x) > 0.

From a practical point of view, the quantity +(x) is interpreted as the viscoelasticity of the
material point x € {) and, in particular in the medical field, is not expected to be known for all
points of 2. By making the physically relevant assumption that v € L>*(Q), v(x) > 0 a.e. in
(allowing the critical case v = 0, or the case where measurements can only me made at isolated
points of the domain), we ask ourselves whether a non-invasive (boundary) action can drive the
acoustic pressure to zero at large times regardless of the particular knowledge of + (as long as it is
nonnegative). This question, besides being of independent interest in stability theory, is critical in
