To this end we recall that (2,2) € C([0,T); H*(Q) x L*(2)). Writing the linear solution of (1.1) (with
k = 0) in the z—variable yields

as needed. Now, in order to show that the boundary conditions are also invariant under the dynamics,
we write (for continuous D(A)—valued solutions):

where the conclusion follows from the fact that the initial conditions for u satisfy the absorbing bound-
ary conditions and the variable z satisfies the absorbing boundary conditions along the trajectory.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.
4 Exponential decays — Proof of Theorem 2.2
In this section we work with the linearized version of (1.1) — i.e., we take k = 0 — in the z—variable.
Moreover, since 7 is fixed, we lose no generality by setting 7 = 1, therefore this is assumed for the
rest of the paper. Recall that the change of variables z = u; + <u transforms (1.2) into
zy + bA(zp + N(kiNTAz)) = —yuy + f. (4.1)
We assume smooth initial conditions and a wu-independent forcing term f € CHR, L*(Q2)). This
ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions which are, in addition, continuously de-
pendent on the initial data. We can eventually extend the results that follow to semigroup solutions
by the virtue of density.
