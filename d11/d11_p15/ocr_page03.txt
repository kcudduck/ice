ensuring global wellposedness of nonlinear solutions. Otherwise the nonlinearity may cause "blow" up
of solutions [12].

It has been recently shown that viscoelastic effects produces, in some cases, the asymptotic
decay of the energy, cf. e.g. [33, 34, 15, 18, 17, 16]. In this work we concentrate on a physically
attractive boundary stabilization — where control action can be applied on the boundary, hence easily
accessible to external manipulations. Of particular interest is a configuration arising in the ultrasound
technology where an acoustic medium is excited on one part of the boundary, while the remaining
part of the boundary is subject to absorbing boundary conditions. This control model was introduced
in |22, 21| in the case of Westervelt-Kuznetsov equation and later pursued in [9] for MGT equation.
This corresponds to the following boundary conditions

AO, u + Ko(x)u = 0 on Xj Ou + k1(z)u; = 0 on > (1.4)
with Ig, I'y CT relatively open, I'g # 0, ToUL'y =, ToNTy = 0, A > 0, ko € L>®(Ty) and x; € L(y),
k(x) > Ky > 0,Kk9 > 0 ae.

Notice that the boundary condition (1.4); — where there is no dissipation —, do not satisfy strong
Lopatinski condition, a fact that leads to new challenges at the level of proving controllability or
stabilization even for a wave equation in dimension higher than one. The technical (mathematical)
reason is that the presence of tangential boundary derivatives cannot be handled by standard flow
multipliers methods. In fact, past contributions to the subject include |5, 6] where [linear dynamics is
considered in the case A =0 and kg = xk; = 1 in (1.4). Thus, the uncontrolled part of the boundary
is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions where Lopatinski condition is satisfied and tangential
derivatives (appearing in the applications of flux multipliers) vanish altogether on I'y. In [5] star—
shaped boundary condition is assumed on I';. This restriction has been removed in |[7| by resorting
to a microlocal analysis argument.

The present paper addresses the challenging case of a nonlinear, critical JMGT dynamics subject
to Neuman/Robin boundary conditions on the undissipated part of the boundary I'y (A = 1). The model
is important in the context of HIFU control theory where boundary open loop strategic control is
activated precisely on this “free” part of the boundary. On the other hand, in such case one encounters
a well recognized PDE predicament: seeking stabilization for a hyperbolic dynamics when Lopatinski
condition [39, 40] fails on undissipated portion of the boundary. This leads to major difficulties
when applying flux multipliers or geometric optics in order to carry the analysis of uniform stability.
Clearly, one expects some restrictions on the geometry of the boundary to cooperate. In the case
of Dirichlet boundary conditions, star—shaped condition suffices. Instead, for the Neumann case
(non—Lopatinski), it turns out that star-shaped along with some convexity is a sufficient condition.
Precise formulation of the corresponding results will be given in the next section. In addition to
new geometric constructs, nonlinearity in the model forces considering stability properties at higher
topological levels with a restricted “smallness” condition imposed on the initial data. The key point
here is that this would make the model “close” to linear. In order to contend with this limitation,
the results presented require smallness conditions imposed only at the low energy level, while higher
derivatives can remain large. We will be able to achieve this goal through boundary dissipation and
small initial data imposed only at the lowest energy level. So the model and the resulting acoustic
