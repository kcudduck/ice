From (4.48) we have obtained that Au(¢) € L*(Q). In addition (u, us, uy) € H implies that u(t) €
HY(Q) and u(t) € HY(Q). By a standard duality argument one this obtains that 0,u(t) € HY/2(T).
We will be able to improve this regularity by appealing to H regularity already obtained in te previous
section. On the other hand, by using invariance of boundary conditions we also have

O,u(t)|r, = —kou(t) € HY2(Ty) O,u(t)|r, = —riw(t) € HY*(T).
By the definition of the norm in Hj the above implies that (u, us, uy) € Hy, as desired. Moreover we
have a control of the norms:
(us wg, wee) [Jy << Cw; ue, wee) [| + | Au) [|2 + [[V Eu) grey + (VEU) [120

< OC ([[(w, wg, ua) [m+ [| Au(t)]]2)

which proved the desired regularity in H;. We are ready to complete the proof.
Let f =0. Adding E(T) + IN E(o)do to both sides of (4.48) we obtain,

and the result follows by Pazy—Datko’s Theorem [37]. ]
