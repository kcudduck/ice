by H;, which is “thighter” than H but strictly larger than D(A). The new phase space Hj; is defined
below

Hy = {€ € H; Ag € L2(Q): [A,&1 + rofl, = 0; [0,6 + ri], = 0} (2.10)
and endowed with the norm

[Ele = N1€llE + 1A + 1€ 52m) + 1€2ll7r2 ry)
or equivalently
1&0, = NEE + IA&Z + 1008/2 ry
Note that the boundary conditions in the definition of the space H; are well defined due to the
property: A& € L2(Q) and & € HY(Q) then 9,& € H YT) — the latter allowing to define the
boundary conditions as a distribution. We also note that since &;,& € HY(Q2) we have &|r € HY2(T)
(i = 1,2) and therefore 0,& € HY?(T"). This along with the elliptic regularity implies:
H, Cc H*(Q) x H'(Q) x L*(Q)

with a proper but not dense injection. We shall show that the operator A also generates a Cy—
semigroup {7'(t)}:>o on Hj. Notice that the nonlinear term is invariant under H; topology in dimen-
sions up to J.
2.2 Main Results
Our first preliminary result is stated below.
Theorem 2.1. The operator A generates a Co—semigroup {S(t)}i=0 on H. Moreover, the family
T(t) :=St)|m,, t = 0, is also a Cy—semigroup with generator A and its realization on Hj.

The second result deals with an exponential stability of the semigroups on the phase space H and
H;. For this, one needs to introduce the following geometric condition.

Assumption 1. The boundary 1'g is star-shaped and convex. This 1s to say: there exists xy € R"
such that (x — xg) - v(x) <0 for all x € Ty where (x) is the outwards normal vector to the boundary
at x. In addition, there exists a convex level set function which defines I'g. See |32].

Theorem 2.2 (Two level uniform stability). Let Assumption 1 on I'y be in force and let v(x) = 0.
Then (i) the semigroup {S(t)}i=0 generated by A in H is uniformly exponentially stable with decay
rate wy > 0 and (it) the semigroup {T'(t)}i>0 generated by A in Hy is uniformly exponentially stable
with decay rate wi; > 0, where wy; < wy.

Once linear wellposedness and uniform stability of the linear (k = 0) problem are established with
respect to the appropriate topologies, our next task is to prove generation of nonlinear semigroup
on H;. To accomplish this, initial data need to be assumed sufficiently small. How small? This is
an important question as argued in [4]. We will be able to show that some smallness will be only
imposed at the lowest level of regularity, while higher derivatives can be large. As a consequence, in
