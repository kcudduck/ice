where J(h) represents the Jacobian matrix of h.
Remark 4.1. We note that the more general typical star-shaped condition A-v < 0 on I'y is not
sufficient. This is due to the presence of tangential derivatives on uncontrolled part of the boundary
which can not be “absorbed” via dissipation by the microlocal argument [30, 43, 29].

This all leads to the following local estimate

10-ullz, < Cllud[s, + Clloyulls, + lotg

valid on solutions. Above, lotyg mean lower order terms on (Q = 2 x [0,7]. By “bending” on the
boundary I'g the radial vector field allows to eliminate its contribution of tangential derivatives. See
Remark 4.3.
Remark 4.2. Convexity of I'y is only one sufficient condition. Several examples where the construction
in (4.9) holds for other types of domains are given in [32].

As mentioned earlier, since we have dissipation only on a portion of the boundary, while the
remaining part is subject to Neuman /Robin type of boundary conditions, standard multiplier theory
with radial vector fields does no apply- due to sign inconsistency in the estimates of tangential
boundary integrals. The introduction of the vector field h € C? in (4.9) is then critical for the results
in this paper.

We start with energetic calculations performed first on regular (strong) solutions. Let’s multiply
equation (4.1) by h- Vz integrate by parts in (s,T — s) x €2, for s € |0,71/2). This gives
