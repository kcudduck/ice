Proof. The energy identity (4.5) is first derived for strong solutions and then extended by density to
weak solutions. Consider the bilinear form (-,-) : H x HH —+ R be given by
Sal» | p2 = (AY2&,, AZ p,) + (&3, ©3) T In (5 (& — “6 ) y P2 — Soi) (4.7)
& #3
which is continuous. Moreover, recalling that ¥ = (u,z, 2z;) it follows that 2FE;(t) = (V(t), U(1)).
Therefore, with G = (0,0, f)' we have, after straightforward calculations (see [6] for details)

Identity (4.5) then follows by an integration in time on |t, 7]. ]
In the next step we reconstruct the integral of the full energy on a truncated time interval (s,7—s)
for 0 <s <T/2.
Proposition 4.3. Let T > 0. If (u,z, 2) 1s a classical solution of (3.4) then the inequality

holds for 0 < s <T/2. Here, lots(z) is a collection of lower order terms satisfying

for some 0 > 0.
Proof. We study stability properties of both S(t) and T(t) assuming the general degenerated case
for v, i.e, v € L>®(2) and v(x) > 0 a.e. in 2. This includes a completely degenerate (critical) case
when v = 0 and the uncontrolled dynamics is unstable. With a feedback boundary control, we will
be able to show that the semigroups can be stabilized — but under additional geometric conditions
which however are stronger than the ones typically assumed in a boundary stabilization theory of
hyperbolic dynamics. It is clear that if I'g = () then the entire boundary I' is dissipated and therefore
stability results would hold true without any additional geometric restrictions. Assuming I'g # 0,
and I'y is star-shaped (standard condition), classical stability methods (multipliers) do not work due
to conflicting signs of radial vector fields on the boundary I'y when acting on tangential derivatives.
This fact has been recognized already in |32|. However,due to convexity of I'y and Assumption | one
obtains the following construction [32]: there exists a vector field h(x) = [hi(x),--- , hq(x)] € C*(Q)
