1983 June July
Fig. 5. Glacier flow velocity versus time over the period 7 June to 7 July 1983 at (A) a point in the upper glacier near Km 5.5, (B) a point in the mid-
dle glacier near Km 9.5, and (C) a point in the lower glacier in the reach Km 13.5 to 15. Each velocity value is plotted as a horizontal line over the
time interval over which it was measured. (The actual velocity as a function of time is doubtless a smooth curve through these data lines.) The
graphs have a common time abscissa; the ordinate scales are offset as indicated. The downward-pointing arrows mark major slowdowns in flow
velocity, which occurred throughout the surging part of the glacier; dashed arrows are shown for the slowdown on 16 to 17 June because of the
complexity of this event. Discontinuities in the data occur where there is a switch between different markers whose motion is being followed.
