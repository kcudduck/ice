The interpretation of the cone structure as the result the acoustic field near the outer points of the sonotrode is
of the combination of a longitudinal traveling wave and a weaker, because this region is less constrained laterally (see
lateral standing wave proposed in Ref. 14] is therefore con- pressure profile in thick solid line in Fig.[10). Therefore, as
