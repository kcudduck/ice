al Abstract
a In a companion paper, a reduced model for propagation of acoustic waves in a cloud of inertial cavitation bubbles was
proposed. The wave attenuation was calculated directly from the energy dissipated by a single bubble, the latter being
= estimated directly from the fully nonlinear radial dynamics. The use of this model in a mono-dimensional configuration
[1 has shown that the attenuation near the vibrating emitter was much higher than predictions obtained from linear theory,
on and that this strong attenuation creates a large traveling wave contribution, even for closed domain where standing waves
C\] are normally expected. In this paper, we show that, owing to the appearance of traveling waves, the primary Bjerknes
force near the emitter becomes very large and tends to expel the bubbles up to a stagnation point. Two-dimensional
=) axi-symmetric computations of the acoustic field created by a large area immersed sonotrode are also performed, and the
— Paths of the bubbles in the resulting Bjerknes force field are sketched. Cone bubble structures are recovered and compare
=r reasonably well to reported experimental results. The underlying mechanisms yielding such structures is examined, and
I it is found that the conical structure is generic and results from the appearance a sound velocity gradient along the
= transducer area. Finally, a more complex system, similar to an ultrasonic bath, in which the sound field results from
. the flexural vibrations of a thin plate, is also simulated. The calculated bubble paths reveal the appearance of other
3 commonly observed structures in such configurations, such as streamers and flare structures.
