   Herein, we concentrate on sono-organic methods and
general trends, which reﬂect well-established points and open
up prospects for future explorations, especially in organic and
medicinal chemistry. We begin with some introductory aspects
of cavitational eﬀects, followed by practical remarks on
common ultrasonic reactors and how a series of external
parameters, often overlooked or misunderstood, matter. The
Perspective continues with some empirical rules, which show
the opportunities and challenges for achieving creativity and
selectivity under eco-friendly conditions. We ﬁnally address
future orientations and innovations, such as piezo-redox
catalysts, ﬂow designs, and in-line automation.

should involve the reaction of electrons from the piezoelectric
material with O2 and H2O leading to superoxide (O2•−) and
OH• radical intermediates. The authors hypothesized that such
radical species may inactivate peroxygenase, thus hampering its
catalytic activity. To minimize the oxidative stress of short-
lived OH• radicals, the enzyme was spatially separated from
BiOCl and placed in a dialysis membrane bag, which allowed
the diﬀusion of H2O2 and products without altering the
catalytic eﬀect.

attention to a few parameters without worrying about others.
In our Perspective, we have given a glimpse on known facts.
One can anticipate that some reactions and substrates will be
sensitive to sonication in either physical or chemical terms.
Whether or not ultrasound switches the conventionally
assumed mechanism often needs further evidence, where the
sonochemical experiment itself can be as informative as other
elucidation methods. Attempts to classify sonochemical
reactions can result in ill-conceived conclusions if structural
and solvent eﬀects that usually accompany cavitation are not
investigated in detail. A reductionist approach that merely
considers either convergent or divergent results with respect to
conventional chemistry may be the key to identifying the tools
that are required to understand how the reaction takes place.
Whatever the mechanism can be, a diﬀerent result under

and energy barriers. As far as we know, cavitation does not
involve an electric ﬁeld component (as once postulated) and
our present-day interpretation relies largely upon the hot spot
theory. Piezoelectric materials, the source of ultrasonic
transducers, are susceptible to electric polarization under
strain. This peripheral eﬀect can advantageously be exploited in
new mechano-redox processes that provide salient and
unexpected results. A translation of cavitational ﬂow into a
continuous operation has enabled further innovation in
microﬂuidics and acoustophoretic devices, which should be
part of the future of chemistry. Despite bottlenecks and
insuﬃcient knowledge of cavitational eﬀects, the impact of
ultrasound-based chemistry is steadily increasing in multiple
synthetic and nonsynthetic applications.
