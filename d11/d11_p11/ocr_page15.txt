Co 3 Simulation of the sound field and resulting
primary Bjerknes force for 5 pum air bub-
bles in water, with an emitter displacement
amplitude is Up= 0.3 pm at 20 kHz. (a):
Pressure amplitude profile. The horizontal
dashed line represents the Blake threshold
for 5 pm bubbles. (b): Bjerknes force ex-
erted on bubbles at each point of the do-
main (with signed logarithmic scale in ordi-
nate). The circles in Fig. (a) represents the
stable stagnation points for the bubble. . .

ture of Fig.[6](the image of Ref | 15] has been
video reversed in order to make the compar-
ison easier) and the numerical results ob-
tained for 2 pm air bubbles, with Uy =
1.4 pm, No = 360 bubbles.mm™. The in-
put intensity is 8.2 W.cm 2. The black lines
are the S-streamers, the blue lines are the L-
streamers, and the thick solid red line is the
Blake threshold contour curve (|P*| = 1.178
for 2 pm bubbles). (a) comparison with the
left part of Fig.[6]; (b) comparison with the
mirrored right part of Fig.[6] The horizon-
tal and vertical lines in the liquid just mark
the separation between various subdomains
and do not have any physical meaning. . . . 7
