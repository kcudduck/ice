3.3. Luminol solution
Similar bubble streamer patterns from the luminol emission photographs are obtained
(Figure|7) to those observed in Figure |3] The light emitted was bright enough to be seen
with the naked eye in adjusted dark conditions.

As can be seen in these images, the SCL and hence radical formation is intensified at
the location of the micropits. The average SCL intensities for the case of luminol solutions
were several orders of magnitude higher than those from the SL in water as presented
in Figure It is surprising then that the total emissions arising from the substrates
containing pits are more or less identical to those arising from the blank substrate at low
power. For the higher power, the two and three pits systems actually produce a lower
yield than the blank substrate. It has been reported before that luminol SCL can have a
unusual dependence with increasing power, sometimes reaching saturation and complete
fading of intensity (Negishi, 1961).

An explanation for our observations is that by driving the systems with two or more
pits at high power, the shape of the bubbles in the cluster become deformed. This, com-
bined with liquid flow inside the microreactor chamber, mixing, free liquid-air interface
oscillation and temperature increase in less than 5 min can bring a change in the SCL.

We speculate that the observation of different SCL signal trends when compared to
our previous study measuring OH radicals (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010) are due to
the surface oscillation taking place at the liquid-air interface of the microreactor at the
higher power conditions as reported before (Tuziuti et al., 2010). More details will be
provided in the coming section [3.4] and also in the supplementary videos.

The pixel intensities of the luminol photographs were also averaged in time and are
presented in Figure 9] It can be seen that the two different experimental techniques
(PMT and photographic imaging) produced similar trends (compare Figure |8| and 9).
From the photographic images taken, it can be seen that luminol emission is intensified
not just at the location of the pits, but also at the edges of the substrate and other
