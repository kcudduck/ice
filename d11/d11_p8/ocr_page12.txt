Figure 10: Averaged SL intensities for the different experimental conditions for propanol
solutions relative to water.

When comparing the relative increase in SCL intensity of luminol over the SL signal
from water, Figure [11]is obtained. Interestingly again the relative intensity is higher for
the low power than for high power (now for the two- and three-pit systems) in line with
our previous findings that higher power can be detrimental to OH- radical formation
(Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010). This can be linked with the fact that at low power the
population of smaller and more spherical bubbles is larger, and it is expected that these
are the ones contributing the most to radical production. Another possibility according
to numerical simulations is that OH" production rate decreases at a too high temperature
inside an air bubble as OH" is consumed by oxidizing nitrogen inside a bubble (Yasui et al.,
2004).E'This may suggest that on average, the temperature inside the bubbles is higher
with pits compared to the blank conditions. Additionally, the bubble temperature is
sometimes increased by the bubble-bubble interaction with smaller bubbles (Yasui et al.,
2011). EIn the situation with pits, smaller and larger bubbles may result in higher bubble
temperature inside larger bubbles compared to the case of no pit (blank) when there are
mainly tiny bubbles (their size is too small to be recorded by the cameras).

Comparing Figures|10|and [11]it can be seen that the blank case is a clear indication of
the strong influence of the contribution from the bubbles generated at the pits. For the
case of one pit it can be observed that there is almost no change in the relative intensity
value for both the propanol and luminol when increasing power. This strongly evidences
that the interaction of the microbubble streamers generated by more than one pit is an
important factor in the trends observed (cluster-cluster interactions through shockwave
emission).

To partially illustrate the complexity of this system the influence of bubble-bubble
and bubble-boundary interactions on the observed SL should be considered. When mi-
crobubbles are exposed to an acoustic field, if smaller than resonant size, they tend to
travel to the pressure antinodes and cluster by virtue of Bjerknes forces. This behavior
may influence the generated SL. An example is the case of high power for the two- and
three-pit systems, where there is a change in the microbubble pattern when compared to
