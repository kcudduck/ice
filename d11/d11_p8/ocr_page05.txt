3. Results and Discussion

Contrary to the highly reproducible characteristics of single bubble cavitation, multi-
ple bubbles are difficult to characterize since the bubble size distribution is constantly
changing and bubbles do not cavitate always in phase with the driving frequency (period
doubling and chaotic behaviors are reported in the literature (Lauterborn & Cramer,
1981; Cabeza et al., 1998)). However, the overall multiple bubble activity can be quan-
tified by measuring the total SL intensity. Figure |2| shows PMT output recorded for
10 s for the three systems studied. Despite the appearance of emission spikes (common
for these systems (Tandiono et al., 2011; Negishi, 1961)), the average intensity of each
system was used for comparison in the following discussion.

The emission spikes along a constant low intensity emission are short pulses that
originate from specific bubbles that, upon reaching an appropriate size in the expansion
phase, collapse and emit a strong light pulse. Micro-shocks occurring within the bubble
during final collapse stages are reported elsewhere both for water and luminol solutions
(Jarman, 1960; Negishi, 1961).

It can be seen in Figure 2| that the emission spikes mainly appear for the water and
luminol system and not that frequently for the aqueous propanol system. Despite the less
frequent presence of these spikes in the propanol system, the average intensity was higher
than that observed for water. This behavior provides evidence that the bubble population
is largely transient as there is no SL quenching (Lee et al., 2005; Price et al., 2004; Toegel
et al., 2002). The presence of propanol can increase the bubble population by lowering
the surface tension and facilitaing the pinch-off events of microbubbles from the pit. The
