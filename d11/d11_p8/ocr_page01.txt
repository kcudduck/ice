far arrangements of pits were studied, with the number of pits ranging from no pits (com-
parable to a classic ultrasound reactor), to three-pits. Where there was more than one

oO solution (50 mM) provided evidence of transient bubble cavitation. Solutions containing
0.1 mM luminol were also used to demonstrate the radical production by attaining the

= 1. Introduction
A well known effect of ultrasonic irradiation in a liquid is acoustic cavitation, which is
the nucleation and consequent collapse of bubbles (Ashokkumar et al., 2007). Sometimes,
bubbles can cavitate in phase with the applied sound frequency. These bubbles behave
as “individual micro-reactors”’, as they are often accompanied by a violent collapse that
leads to high pressures and temperatures within and in the local vicinity of the bubbles
(Lohse, 2005; Didenko & Suslick, 2002; Brenner et al., 2002). Among the events generated
during such collapses, some can be identified as plasma formation, lysis of molecules
yielding radicals (water molecule sonolysis is a well known example), strong pressure
shockwaves, liquid jetting and surface erosion. Although the driving condition is constant
