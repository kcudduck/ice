exposure times required to obtain images like the ones presented in Figure |5| made it
very difficult to cover the same experimental conditions as for the rest of this work.

Nevertheless, these results allow us to conclude that the SL signal detected with the
PMT was primarily due to light emission from the bubbles ejected from the micropits
and not from random cavitation events in the bulk liquid.

3.2. Aqueous propanol solution
The visible bubble pattern for aqueous propanol solutions had no evident change when
compared to water; however, as presented in Figure[2] spikes present in the water emission
profile are not as frequent in propanol solutions and the spike height is on average lower.
The average intensities for propanol solutions are presented in Figure [6]

Propanol can cause two effects in sonicated liquids: by adsorbing to the bubble solution
interface it hinders bubble coalescence. And due to its volatile nature, it evaporates into
the bubble and lowers the polytropic exponent, resulting in less heating inside the bubble
(Toegel et al., 2002). These two effects can affect the SL in two ways. The hindrance
to bubble coalescence has been shown to increase the number of transient cavitation
bubbles (Price et al., 2004). The volatile nature leads to significant SL quenching in stable
cavitation bubbles (Guan & Matula, 2003). However, both processes need sufficient time
for the propanol to accumulate at the bubble interface. Here, under the conditions of
transient cavitation this time is not given. The observation that the average SL intensity
