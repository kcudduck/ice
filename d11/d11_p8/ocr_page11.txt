Figure 9: Averaged pixel intensity values from the luminol images recorded (SCL) for the
different experimental conditions for aqueous luminol solutions. Besides the blue light
coming from the center of the silicon substrate (microbubbles generated from the pits) in
some cases some SCL signal is seen coming from the edges of the substrate; presumably
from crevices existing in the glass reaction chamber or substrate edges.
