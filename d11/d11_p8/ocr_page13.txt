the one-pit and blank configuration. A bubble cloud reflects and absorbs the sound field
such that a lower intensity will be experienced by bubbles inside the cloud due to shield-
ing. This reduces the intensity of the bubble collapse and the active bubble population,
leading to a reduced SL intensity when compared to conventional multibubble cavitation
(Zeravcic et al., 2011). As mentioned above bubble collapse in clusters also results in
smaller expansion maximum radius and shorter collapse times (Yasui et al., 2008a).

It has been modeled and experimentally confirmed for a single bubble that the strength
of the bubble collapse is affected by its translational movement (accelerated due to added
mass forces while the driving pressure increases), and that the strength of the bubble
collapse and its sphericity (i.e., the focusing power) are key ingredients determining the
SL and SCL intensity (Brenner et al., 1995; Sadighi-Bonabi et al., 2009; Hatanaka et al.,
2002; Brenner et al., 2002). Indeed, in our experiments higher SL is observed for higher
power.

Referring back to Figure 3| At high power, for the two- and three-pit cases (two last
figures in the right column of Figure 13), we see bubble clustering in between the pits,
leading to a depletion of bubbles directly above the respective pits. Therefore, in these
cases, the bubbles are actually only cavitating in a thin liquid layer of a width of about
200 pm above the surface (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2012). Consequently, there is then
less mutual shielding of the bubbles as compared to the other four cases (one-pit case at
both powers and two- and three-pit cases at low powers). Additionally, at higher power
there will be bubbles that expand to a larger size than at lower power, resulting in an
increase in SL. We also expect that shockwave emissions from bubble clusters and cluster-
cluster interactions (among microbubble streamers generated at each pit) influence the
overall SL and SCL in terms of bubble maximum radius and collapse time as has been
demonstrated before (Yasui et al., 2008a).

Observations at the highest power give evidence that water can occasionally splash out
from the liquid-air interface due to acoustic radiation force (see supplementary video).
This has been reported to decrease the efficiency of sonochemical reactions (Tuziuti et al.,
2010), consistent with the reduced SCL signal at high power and regimes with more than
