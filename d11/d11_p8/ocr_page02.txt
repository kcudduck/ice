in most cases, the cavitation bubbles are never exactly the same due to the complexity
of the phenomena involved (Lauterborn & Kurz, 2010), rendering it difficult to obtain
a deterministic relation between driving conditions and actual bubble population. To
complement direct determination of bubble size distributions which require fast imaging
and intensive image processing, a good alternative is the use of indirect methods like
measuring the light emitted by these bubbles.

Most researchers agree that the studies of Marinesco and Trillat (Marinesco & Trillat,
1933) and Frenzel and Shultes (Frenzel & Schultes, 1934) were the first in which light
emission could be detected as a result of ultrasound irradiation in a liquid sample. After
several studies to determine the actual mechanism behind this remarkable effect, sono-
luminescence (SL) has been described as the light emitted by cavitation bubbles driven
by an ultrasonic driving pressure field. Sonochemiluminescence (SCL) is defined in this
study as the light emission when luminol reacts with OH radicals. There is a large
difference between the SL emission from a single bubble (SBSL) and SL from a cluster of
bubbles (MBSL, i.e. multibubble SL). For SBSL the collapse is nearly spherically sym-
metric and highly reproducible (Brenner et al., 2002); and for MBSL the more frequent
non repeatable asymmetric collapse produces liquid jets penetrating the hot bubble con-
tents (Crum, 1994; Flint & Suslick, 1991; Matula & Roy, 1997; W.B. McNamara III,
2000). These differences are evident in the emission profile and spectra produced from
both types of SL. The spectra collected from MBSL contain many peaks and features,
whereas the spectra emanating from SBSL are normally featureless (Suslick et al., 1999;
Suslick & Flannigan, 2008). The effect of power and frequency on bubble-size distribu-
tions of MBSL in acoustic cavitation has been studied previously using pulsed ultrasound
(Brotchie et al., 2009). The main conclusion was that the mean bubble size increased
with increasing acoustic power and at the same time decreased with increasing ultra-
sound frequency. Additionally, the mean bubble size distribution of bubbles emitting SL
was larger and narrower than SCL producing bubbles (centred at smaller bubble sizes
and broader) meaning that the two processes result from different bubble sizes (Yasui
et al., 20080) and the physical locations in which these bubbles exist can differ (Sunartio
et al., 2007). MBSL has also a defined phase window of the driving pressure oscillation,
meaning that in a phase window of about 30° from the full 360° SL can be detected
(Lauterborn & Kurz, 2010). Other researchers have reported singular dependences of SL
and capillary pressure in small gaps with an implicit advantage in not using a light-proof
box to quantity multibubble intertial cavitation thresholds (N.V. Dezhkunov, 2004).

Sonochemistry performed in microfluidic devices has received some attention in the last
decade (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010; Iida et al., 2004: Lee et al., 2007; Tandiono et al.,
2011). In this work an extended study on an ultrasonic microreactor described before
(Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010) is presented. The working principle of that sonoreactor is
based on the ability of small predefined crevices (pits etched in silicon substrate surface
(Bremond et al., 2006b a; Marmottant et al., 2006; Borkent et al., 2009)) to stabilize
small gas nuclei. When the ultrasound is turned on, a characteristic microbubble cloud
appears, that would not be present in the absence of pits. In this way a continuous locally
controlled generation of cavitating microbubbles is achieved. The chemical activity of
these microbubbles was previously verified by luminol SCL imaging and OH radical
dosimetry by using terephthalic acid (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010).

The aim of the present work was to study the changes of SL and SCL intensities em-
anating from different solutions as the population of microbubbles nucleated from the
pits on the silicon substrate varies. This is influenced by altering the power input to the
system and the number of pits. The areas of potential application for these findings are
many; to name a few we consider the ultrapurification of water for fine chemicals or phar-
