Figure 5: SL image from bubble streamers for different scenarios. The top row corre-
sponds to three-pit cases with similar pattern as observed under visible conditions for
high and low power. The remaining figures correspond to one-, two-pit cases at low
power
for the propanol system instead of quenching the SL signal is higher than that observed
in water is in agreement with the fact that the cavitation bubbles generated in the
microreactor are transient in nature. As suggested earlier, the lower surface tension of
the bubble stabilized on the pit due to the presence of propanol might yield a higher
number of bubble streamers generated that in turn contribute to the increase in SL
signal. This needs to be supported by future experiments with fast imaging of all these
conditions.
