Silicon substrate micromachining
Three different configurations of pits were designed. The pits had the same diameter

(30um) and were arranged in sets of one, two (in a line) or three (in a triangle) at a
distance of 1000 um from each other (see Figure|12). The substrates were micromachined
under clean room conditions on double-side polished silicon wafers and spin coated with
the photosensitive substance Olin 12, on which the designed pattern was transferred with
a mask aligner EV620 (photolitography). After development the pit pattern was open
and with a plasma dry-etching machine Adixen AMS 100 SE (Alcatel) process BHARS,
the holes were etched into the silicon substrate at the desired depth. The machined diced
silicon square pieces of 1 cm-side were mounted to the bottom of a small glass container
which contained a liquid volume of 300 wf, to the bottom of which a piezo element was
attached.
