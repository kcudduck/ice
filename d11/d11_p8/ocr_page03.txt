Sonoluminescence and sonochemiluminescence from a microreactor 3
maceutical uses, mechanochemistry and the selective cleaning of circuit boards in which
localized cavitation can avoid the damage of certain components with conventional soni-
cation systems (G. Cravotto, 2012; Cobley et al., 2011). Our results can be of importance
to existing non destructive testing and inspection of surfaces with localized fluorescent dye
penetration which are improved by the action of localized cavitation(N.V. Dezhkunov,
2005).

Additionally for biological applications where a localized source of radicals, light and
streaming forces are required, this system might be beneficial (Ohl & Wolfrum, 2003;
Dijkink et al., 2008).

2. Material and Methods

This work focused on the measurement of the SL and SCL intensities emitted from
three different systems. The first was air-saturated Milli-Q) water, the second was air
saturated propanol solution (50 mM) in water and the third was air saturated aqueous
luminol (0.1 mM luminol in 0.1 M NaOH) solution. SL intensities were obtained for
water and propanol, whereas SCL intensities were measured for luminol. Additionally
SL images were recorded in argon saturated water.

In most cavitating systems, there exist populations of SL active and SCL active bubbles
(Ashokkumar et al., 2010). These populations strongly overlap: SL active bubbles can be
SCL active, and vice versa. SL active bubbles correspond to bubbles that satisfy suitable
conditions (pressure and temperature) inside the bubble that allow for ionization and the
subsequent light emission (Hilgenfeldt et al., 1999). SCL active bubbles produce radicals
(OH radicals in this case):

AH=5.1eV

Recording the light emission from luminol molecules reacting with OH is a widely
used method to quantify the chemical activity and map active zones in a sonoreactor.
Evidently knowing the exact bubble size distribution and their spatial localization is very
difficult ((Luther et al., 2001; Tsochatzidis et al., 2001; Fernandez Rivas et al., 2012)),
and most studies are based on bubble dissolution when US is turned oft (Brotchie et al.,
2009; Labouret & Frohly, 2002; Chen et al., 2002). By virtue of dissolved propanol in
water, information about the presence of transient cavitating bubbles can be obtained
(Ashokkumar et al., 2009; Price et al., 2004). It has been shown that alcohols do not
quench SL arising from transient cavitation (i.e., MBSL), as the alcohol molecules do not
have enough time to accumulate on the interface of the transiently cavitating bubbles
(Price et al., 2004). That is in vast contrast to stable SBSL, where alcohols strongly
quench the light emission (Toegel et al., 2000).

2.1. Set-up for US experiments
A scheme of the experimental setup used is shown in Figure|1] The reaction chamber was
a glass container of 25 mm outer diameter, 15 mm inner diameter and depth of 2 mm,
and bottom thickness of 2 mm. The bottom thickness matched the quarter-wavelength
vibration imparted by a piezo Ferroperm PZ27 6 mm thick with a diameter of 25 mm,
glued to the bottom of the reaction chamber.

The ultrasonic wave was generated by a Hameg HM 8131-2 arbitrary waveform gener-
ator and amplified by a Krohn-Hite Model 7500 amplifier for the sonochemical reaction
experiments and a LeCroy WaveSurfer 452 oscilloscope to read-out PMT measurements.

The powers used for the experiments were calculated from calorimetric measurements
