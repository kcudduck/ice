with a Hanna K-type Thermocouple leading to 12.7 W for the high power and 3.32 W
for the low power settings. Since control over the heating of the liquid volume was not
available, temperature measurements were carried out before and after irradiation times
of 3 minutes at similar conditions at which the SL and SCL signals were recorded. The
thermocouple was removed from the liquid chamber during sonication to avoid damaging
the thermocouple tip. At low power (3.32 W) the temperature did not increase by more
than 3 K. For high power (12.7 W) the temperature increase was of 10 K. The 10 s
period would generate an increase in temperature of around 0.6 K. We overestimate the
temperature increase to be at least 1 K (2 K maximum) to be conservative. For this
reason, the PMT measurements lasted in general no longer than 10 s to avoid large
temperature variations.

The continuously applied acoustic field generated a standing wave depending on the
height of the liquid column. For liquid heights close to one-quarter or three-quarters
of the acoustic wavelength (approximately 250 or 300 pf volume of liquid, respectively)
a pressure antinode is expected to be located on the substrate and a node at the free
liquid-air interface. In this study frequencies of about 200 kHz with a corresponding
water height of approximately 5 mm were used (250 uf).

A Hamamatsu E849-35 PMT (2.5 ns risetime), with 15 mm diameter glass window,
amplified by a Canberra H.V. Supply Model 3002 was placed to capture the light emitted
by the sonicated liquid on top of the chamber.

The experiments were conducted with different liquids but the same volumes (250 uf)
at ambient conditions and open to the atmosphere. The voltage readout of the PMT
corresponded to the SL and SCL emission, where applicable, from a certain population
of bubbles.

The variations to the bottom surface (square silicon substrate of 10 mm width) of
the micro-sonoreactor (the same as presented in (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010)) were:
blank with no pit (equivalent to a conventional US reactor of the bath type), one, two
or three pits (small predefined cylindrical crevices on the silicon surface). The pits acted
as nucleation sites for microbubble streamers that would otherwise not be present at the
conditions studied.

Two different power settings were chosen out of the three presented in (Fernandez Rivas
et al., 2010), corresponding to lower and higher power levels. The main reason to select
these two settings is that they evidence a clear difference in the bubble pattern and the
ultrasonic power being supplied to the whole system. Hence, we expect to see differences
in the bubble populations capable of emitting light and producing radicals in all cases.

The controlled and localized acoustic microbubble generation can be sustained for
at least several hours due to dissolved gas in the liquid transported into the pit by
a process similar to rectified diffusion (Brenner et al., 2002; Apfel, 1970; Crum, 1982;
Fowlkes & Crum, 1988). Since temperature and gas escaping the microchamber could
not be controlled in this particular case, all experiments were carried out within 5 to 10
minutes.

For the SCL imaging, a digital SLR camera (Nikon D90) with 18-55 mm AFS zoom
lens using the settings ISO1250, f 5.0 and a 60 s exposure time.

For SL imaging a NF Multifunction synthesizer WF-1946A with a NF HSA-4014 am-
plifier, and a fan to cool the microreactor were used to get similar conditions as described
betore. The exposure time for experimental imaging and dark conditions subtraction was
10 minutes with a BitranBS-41L cooled CCD camera coupled to a Nikkor 35 mm lens
and a magnifying glass.
