one pit. As the meniscus shakes vigorously (a sizzling sound accompanies this process),
the cavitation field changes considerably in a way difficult to quantify or predict. This
can introduce sources of errors in the SL and SCL measurements. In addition, at the
highest power heating and degassing of the liquid occur faster and this obviously changes
the conditions for SL and SCL.

It would be interesting to correlate the observed SL profile measured in this study to
the influence of fluid mechanics such as low due to acoustic streaming, microstreaming by
meniscus oscillation, microbubbles flowing at different regimes, the interplay of secondary
Bjerknes forces and bubble cluster interaction with the overall low. Other factors such
as closing the system with the presence of a glass slide on top of the microreactor to
minimize liquid splashing, are among several other conditions that could be investigated
but the appearance of degassing bubbles on the glass surface might be an undesired side-
effect (see supplementary video). The above mentioned factors would influence the light
emission, both from SL and SCL, at the different powers. As a last effort, continuous
recording of these bubble streamers (in water, propanol and luminol solutions) may
provide further clues to better understand our findings.

4. Conclusions
We have measured light emission at a single frequency from different systems at two

different power levels in the presence and absence of pits on surfaces. These pits promoted
nucleation of microbubble streamers with distinctive streaming patterns at each power
level. SL and SCL imaging provided evidence that the microbubbles arising from the pits
are responsible for most of the light emission detected with PMT measurements. The
presence of transient cavitation conditions was verified by measuring the SL intensity
in propanol solutions. A difference in the light intensity of SL and SCL also led to the
conclusion that there is a difference in the bubble population able to emit light and
those which are chemically active. The multiple factors affecting the bubble streamers
behavior are difficult to resolve individually. For that reason, there exists significant
scope for future studies, particularly involving the control of the free surface liquid-air
meniscus.
