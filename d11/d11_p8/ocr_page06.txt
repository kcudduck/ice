white space in between the signal and the “x-axis” for propanol and luminol, not present
in plain water, is due to a higher overall SL and SCL intensity. A more detailed analysis
for each system is presented in the following sections.
3.1. Water
When water is poured over the silicon substrate and US is switched on, a cloud of bubbles
appears from the micropits at low power levels. An interesting behavior is observed when
there are multiple pits driven at high power: the ejected bubbles travel to a common
center point (see Figure 3|and supporting videos) due to a complex interplay of primary
and secondary Bjerknes forces (Fernandez Rivas et al., 2010).

Figure[4] shows a clear trend of increasing SL intensity with increasing number of pits,
both at the low and high power regimes.

As the number of pits is increased, the number of SL active bubbles increases. The
increase is almost double in the case of one-pit compared with the blank substrate.
For two-pits, the SL enhancement is tripled, whilst for three-pits the SL is almost four
times that of the blank substrate at high power. While a similar increase is observed
at the higher power level, the relative increase with three-pits compared to two-pits is
low. This might be due to stronger bubble clustering effects which are known to reduce
the maximum expansion radius and shorten the bubble collapse duration (Yasui et al.,
2008a).

When trying to image SL in the experiments with air-saturated Milli-Q water and
the conditions described up to this point, not enough signal-to-noise images could be
obtained. For this reason Milli-Q water was saturated with argon (Ar) and a glass
slide was placed on top of the microreactor to avoid evaporation (see supporting video).
During the imaging period the cooling of the piezo was carried out with a fan. The long
