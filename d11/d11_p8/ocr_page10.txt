locations like cracks on the silicon substrate edge or the corners of the microchamber
which can act as nucleation sites. Such effects occur across all the experiments and will
be additive to the luminol emission from the pits. The PMT used to measure the SCL
yield picks up light not just from the pits but also from the other places described.

3.4. Comparing SL and SCL

In Figure [10] the relative increase of the SL intensity in water and propanol solutions is
compared. Note that for all situations there is an increase in SL intensity of propanol
over water as described before. For two- and one-pit cases the low power shows a higher
relative value than at high power (when the bubble streamers travel parallel to the wall
and towards the center point) where the bubble population vary as the bubble clouds
change their shape.
