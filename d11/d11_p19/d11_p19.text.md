Glacier hydromechanics: early insights and the lasting legacy of three works by Iken and colleagues  Gwenn E. FLOWERS  Department of Earth Sciences, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada E-mail: gflowers@sfu.ca  ABSTRACT. The   association   between   basal   hydrology   and   glacier   sliding   has   become   nearly synonymous with the early work of Almut Iken and colleagues. Their research published in the   Journal of Glaciology   from 1981 to 1986 made an indelible impact on the study of glacier hydromechanics by documenting strong correlations between basal water pressure and short-term ice-flow variations. With a   passion   for   elucidating   the   physics   of   glacier-bed   processes,   Iken   herself   made   fundamental contributions to our theoretical and empirical understanding of the sliding process. From the theoretical bound on basal shear stress, to the inferences drawn from detailed horizontal and vertical velocity measurements, the work of Iken and colleagues continues to inform the interpretation of data from alpine glaciers and has found increasing relevance to observations from the ice sheets. INTRODUCTION  Hydromechanical processes operating at the glacier bed are responsible for some of the most intriguing ice-flow pheno- mena, including glacier surging (e.g. Kamb and others, 1985) and ice streaming (e.g. Alley and others, 1986). Since its inception, the   Journal of Glaciology   has been a repository for works addressing glacier hydromechanics with such seminal contributions as those of Weertman (1964), Lliboutry (1968) and Budd and others (1979). Among the most influential and highly cited works on this topic are several by Almut Iken and colleagues dating to the 1980s. These pioneering works collectively examine the intimate coupling between basal hydrology   and   ice   dynamics   and   its   power   to   explain measurable phenomena, such as seasonal uplift of the glacier surface (Iken and others, 1983) and short-term variations in glacier flow speed (Iken, 1981; Iken and Bindschadler, 1986). In celebration of the publication of the 200th issue of the  Journal of Glaciology , we look back at the insights hatched in these three papers and trace their influence to the present day. These works remain staples for those with a passion for alpine glacier   dynamics   and   are   being   rediscovered   by   those seeking to unravel some of the ice-sheet observations so newsworthy in recent years.  BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT  At the time the work of Iken and colleagues was published, it   had   been   over   20   years   since   Weertman   (1957) introduced   his   sliding   theory   based   on   regelation   and enhanced creep around obstacles at the bed. The notion of sliding as a contributor to overall glacier motion had been recognized   previously   (e.g.   Gerrard   and   others,   1952; Haefeli,   1957),   with   its   study   dating   back   to   the   mid- 1800s (Hopkins, 1845, 1849). Lliboutry (1958) introduced ice–bed   separation   (cavitation)   into   sliding   theory,   thus formally admitting a primary role for basal water pressure. Weertman’s (1964) work became the basis for a sliding law of   the   form   u   ¼   C  p   = N   q   (e.g.   Budd   and   others,   1979; Bindschadler, 1983; Fowler, 1987), still in use today, with sliding   speed   u ,   constant   C   which   depends   on   bed geometry, basal shear stress    , effective pressure   N   and positive constants   p   and   q   often set to 3 and 1, respectively. Subsequent   work   in   the   late   1960s   and   1970s   would generalize   sliding   theory   and   extend   it   to   a   variety   of idealized bed configurations (e.g. Nye, 1969, 1970; Kamb, 1970; Morland, 1976a; Fowler, 1979). At the same time, a variety of conceptual models of englacial and subglacial water flow were emerging that would shape our picture of glacier drainage for decades to come. The year 1972 alone saw the publication of theories describing water flow along englacial potential gradients (Shreve, 1972), in a thin film at the bed (Weertman, 1972) and   in   ice-walled   conduits   (later   ‘R-channels’)   (Ro ¨ thlis- berger, 1972). These works were contemporaneous with the early studies of jo ¨ kulhlaups (e.g. Bjo ¨ rnsson, 1974; Nye, 1976) and complemented observational studies of englacial or subglacial hydrology which were focused largely on attempts to measure basal water pressure (e.g. Mathews, 1964; Hodge, 1976). It was in this context that Iken began her career in glaciology.   As   a   student   with   Fritz   Mu ¨ ller   at   McGill University   her   earliest   work   was   carried   out   on   White Glacier in the Canadian Arctic as part of the Axel Heiberg Island Expedition (Iken, 1972, 1974; Mu ¨ ller and Iken, 1973). She was given, according to some of her contemporaries, the obscure and unrewarding assignment of trying to measure short-term velocity fluctuations of White Glacier. Conven- tional wisdom held that the glacier should be frozen to its bed, hence free of such variability. In 1967, Iken conducted stake surveys at 3 hour intervals over 2 weeks in the ablation area of White Glacier and detected diurnal variations in flow speed (Iken, 1974). This ignited her interest in the theoretical and   observed   relationships   between   water pressure   and sliding velocity, to which she would dedicate much of her career. Her research would take her back to the Alps and eventually to Alaska and Greenland.  INSIGHTS FROM SELECTED WORKS  This section highlights three of the most enduring works of Iken and her colleagues. These were chosen in part for their numerous citations, but primarily based on a ‘focus group’ approach to identifying the most influential   Journal   papers and the favourites of   Journal   readers.

Modelled water-pressure effect on sliding (Iken, 1981)  Motivated by observations of short-term velocity variations in glacier flow   speed (Iken, 1978) and the relationship between measured vertical and horizontal velocities (Iken and others, 1983), Iken (1981) constructed an idealized model to investigate the relationship between subglacial water pressure and glacier sliding. Although water pressure had been linked to basal motion through several proposed mechanisms (e.g. Lliboutry, 1968; Jones, 1979), the obser- vations motivated the idealization of the glacier bed as an impermeable undulating surface. Building on the theoret- ical   work   of   Lliboutry   (1968,   1979)   and   Kamb   (1970), Iken (1981) aimed specifically to examine the effect of water pressure on sliding during the transient stages of cavity development. Assuming a perfectly lubricated glacier bed, a linear ice rheology and instantaneous water supply or drainage, Iken (1981)   employed   a   finite-element   code   for   stress–strain analysis developed originally at Eidgeno ¨ ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) for tunnel construction. Both sinusoidal and quasi-sinusoidal bed shapes were considered (undula- tions of 20 m wavelength and 1.5 m amplitude), with an ice thickness (310 m) and bed slope (4 8 ) chosen to resemble those of Unteraargletscher, Switzerland. While the finite- element code was reasonably amenable to this problem, several   manual   interventions   were   required   including: (1)   an   iteration   to   ensure   consistency   between   a   given water   pressure   and   the   affected   bed   area;   (2)   careful positioning of the nodes at the downstream end of the cavity roof to insure bed-parallel ice motion at the point of contact;   and   (3)   a   trial-and-error   approach   to   defining correct steady-state cavity configurations for a given water pressure. Iken was among the first to employ finite-element methods to solve glacier flow problems (e.g. Iken, 1977), in part   because   of   the   extraordinary   patience   required; iterations were performed manually with punch cards until convergence was reached. The   results   of   this   modelling   effort   clearly   illustrated sliding   enhancement   in   response   to   an   applied   water pressure between the ‘separation pressure’   p s   (e.g. Lliboutry, 1968; Nye, 1969; Kamb, 1970), defining the onset of ice– bed separation, and the ‘limiting’ or ‘critical’ water pressure  p 1   ¼    gd   sin   ð      Þ =   sin   derived by Iken (Fig. 1), beyond which unstable sliding was predicted to occur. At the onset of cavity formation, simulated ice flow near the bed became more plug-like; flow speeds exceeded those modelled when the cavities reached steady state, where ice–bed separation was at its maximum (cf. figs 4b, 5b and 6a in Iken, 1981). A small decrease in water pressure precipitated a dramatic change   in   the   modelled   flow   field,   including   transient reverse sliding above the   stoss face of the downstream obstacle. This intriguing latter prediction remains neither confirmed nor refuted by observations, though some forms of   reverse   glacier   motion   have   been   documented   (e.g. Harrison and others, 1986). Iken (1981) drew several important conclusions related to the effect of bed geometry, cavity extent and water pressure on   sliding   velocity:   (1)   bed   configurations   with   lower separation pressures (e.g. obstacles with steep lee faces) produce   a   stronger   sliding   velocity   response   to   water pressure; (2) sliding sensitivity to water-pressure increases with the area over which the water pressure acts and also depends on the orientation of the area; (3) if this area remains constant, sliding speed increases linearly with water pressure for a Newtonian ice rheology; and (4) sliding is most sensitive to water pressure at the inception of cavity formation, rather than when cavities reach their maximum steady-state sizes. Thus, sliding speed is predicted to be highest during the early stages of cavity growth. Iken (1981) concluded that ‘sliding velocity is neither simply a function of the subglacial water pressure nor of the size   of   cavities   but   depends   on   both   variables’,   and speculated that observations of early season glacier accel- eration may be the manifestation of unstable sliding at water pressures below overburden. She suggested that the limited duration of these events may be related to limited water supply   and   imperfect   hydraulic   connectivity   across   the glacier bed. Future observations, including those of Iken and Bindschadler (1986), would reveal stable sliding at pressures greater than the critical pressure, pointing to a role for basal friction as suggested by Iken (1981) and later modelled by Schweizer and Iken (1992) and to global force- balance controls on the sliding process (e.g. Cuffey and Paterson, 2010).  Seasonal uplift and basal water storage (Iken and others, 1983)  Up to 0.6 m of surface elevation increase was observed at the beginning of the melt season on Unteraargletscher by Iken and others (1983) using a combination of optical survey data and photographs from an automatic camera. The authors speculated that a similar ‘uplift’ may have been observed on Unteraargletscher as early as 1842/43 by   Louis Agassiz (Agassiz, 1847). In 1975, theodolite measurements of poles arranged   in   four   transverse   profiles   were   undertaken   at intervals from 2 hours to 3 days. At the pole where the highest-resolution measurements were made, errors were controlled such that vertical positions were known to 2 mm. The data showed stable downward stake movement over winter giving way to a prolonged period of summer uplift, which was punctuated by several uplift events associated with periods of enhanced melt. Iken and others (1983) clearly documented   the   coincidence   of   maxima   in   horizontal velocities and maxima in vertical velocities, rather than vertical displacements (Fig. 2; fig. 3 in Iken and others, 1983). That   horizontal   velocity   maxima   occurred   during   uplift appeared to confirm the principal finding of Iken (1981). Iken and others (1983) interpreted these observations as the result of cavity growth at the glacier bed in response to  Fig. 1.

pressurized water, pointing to the dominant influence of water pressure on glacier sliding speed. They came to this conclusion by systematically ruling out the following as leading   explanations   for   the   observed   uplift:   temporal variations in longitudinal strain rate, increases in glacier volume   due   to   crevasse   formation,   expansion   of   intra- granular veins and dilatation of subglacial sediments. This rigorous approach to attribution was characteristic of Iken’s work throughout her career. In seeking to explain how a minimum of 0.3 m of water could be stored in cavities at the bed without precipitating unstable sliding, Iken and others (1983) calculated that sinusoidal undulations of 0.56 m in amplitude covering most of the glacier bed could accom- modate the water; however, they speculated that the cavities were   probably   more   compact   than   this   and   perhaps asymmetric in shape, with more steeply inclined stoss faces. The data in Figure 2 have become the classical empirical demonstration of ‘hard-bedded’ sliding.  Observed water-pressure effect on sliding (Iken and Bindschadler, 1986)  Iken and Bindschadler (1986) put the theoretical under- pinnings of basal sliding (e.g. Lliboutry, 1968, 1979; Kamb, 1970; Iken, 1981; Fowler, 1986) to the test with simul- taneous measurements of borehole water level and surface velocity at Findelengletscher. This temperate valley glacier, located in the Pennine Alps of Switzerland, was chosen because of its observed sensitivity to changes in water input (e.g. Iken, 1978). Ice-surface velocities were obtained from sub-daily optical surveys of velocity stakes arranged in four rows transverse to ice flow. These measurements were not automated, hence their temporal resolution was propor- tional to surveyor effort. Twenty-five boreholes were drilled to the bed over a laterally confined    1 km section of the glacier, using hot-water drilling capability that Iken was instrumental in developing (Iken and others, 1977). Bore- hole water levels were monitored with membrane gauges and Goerz ‘Miniscript’ recorders. These recorders employed pens and rolls of paper and had the advantage, according to Iken, of allowing one to easily verify their operation and inspect the data. Checking the Miniscript was usually the first task of the morning and in at least one case, when exceptionally high water levels were recorded, prompted a round of survey measurements before breakfast. Hydraulic   connections   with   the   englacial/subglacial drainage system were observed in 11 of the 25 boreholes, and water levels in the connected holes were found to be roughly parallel to the ice surface across the borehole array. Diurnal cycling of water levels commenced in early June, with daily peaks generally being synchronous across the array and lagging the local peak in surface melt by 6– 8 hours. Multi-day variations in horizontal velocity at the stake locations were strongly correlated to borehole water levels.   Iken   and   Bindschadler   (1986)   emphasized   this correlation between flow speed and basal water pressure, but commented little on the precise phasing between the two during transient events. The data they presented showed velocity maxima generally occurring during rising water pressures, though this relationship was not a tidy one. When Iken and Bindschadler (1986) plotted one of these velocity records from the central study area against water level averaged over four of the connected boreholes (Fig. 3; fig.   6   in   Iken   and   Bindschadler,   1986),   a   relationship emerged that encapsulates the central result of this study. This relationship becomes asymptotic where basal water pressure   approaches   the   ice   overburden   pressure,   and appears to hold over a wide range of water levels and for data   collected   over   different   time   periods   and   in   two different years. Iken   and   Bindschadler   (1986)   interpreted   these   data, along with the results of dye-tracing tests and electrical conductivity   measurements,   as   evidence   for   drainage through a system of interconnected cavities (e.g. Lliboutry, 1968,   1979)   where   cavity   growth   is   a   function   of subglacial water pressure (e.g. Iken, 1981). To arrive at this interpretation, they ruled out decoupling of the glacier sole from the bed by flotation, based on the measured water   pressures   being   too   low,   and   pervasive   sediment deformation, which would not explain the persistence of the   functional   relationship   at   low   water   pressures.   The stability   of   the   relationship   in   time   required   that   the basal shear stress and the fraction of the bed subject to water-pressure variations remained roughly constant. The rapid borehole response to several waves of high basal water pressure was interpreted as reflecting the enlarge- ment of cavities and, in cases of water pressure meeting or   exceeding   overburden,   rapid   bed   separation.   The low   propagation   speeds   of   these   pressure   waves (  50–180 m h   –1   ) also pointed to a system capable of water storage along a tortuous flow path. The behaviour described above contrasted with that documented by Iken and others (1996) for the central region of Gornergletscher, Valais, Switzerland, where the presence of a subglacial sediment  Fig. 2.

layer was inferred from the damped and delayed response of the drainage system to hydraulic perturbations. The data in Figure 3 were compared with theoretical predictions,   namely   the   sliding   speed   over   a   perfectly lubricated sinusoidal bed for a constant basal shear stress. Empirical estimates of the separation pressure   p s   corres- ponded to water levels of 140–180 m below the surface and were obtained from Figure 3 by extrapolating the relationship to a horizontal tangent at low water levels. Values of bed roughness   a =      0.02   were   obtained   for   the   empirical separation pressures according to   p s   ¼    0      = a , where   0   is the ice overburden pressure,      and   a   are the wavelength and amplitude of sinusoidal bed undulations, respectively, and         1 bar is the basal shear stress. These roughness values were deemed consistent with the visible bedrock undulations of the proglacial area, but when used to calculate the limiting or critical pressure for a sinusoidal bed,   p c   ¼    0      = 2  a , predicted unstable sliding at pressures that were far too low. The data in fact suggested a critical pressure very near the ice overburden pressure. Iken and Bindschadler (1986) isolated the assumption of perfect basal lubrication as the leading shortcoming in their theoretical calculations and suggested that friction due to basal debris may play a significant role in reducing the basal shear stress that contributes to sliding. They   concluded   with   one   of   the   rarely   mentioned   but inevitable truths regarding the interpretation of field data: ‘In order to reach conclusions, it was often necessary to generalize the results of measurements made at a very limited number of points and, furthermore, to decide sometimes what was typical or irregular.’ In a germane follow-up study, Iken and Truffer (1997) made similar measurements to those of Iken and Bind- schadler (1986) on Findelengletscher during its advance in the early 1980s and its subsequent retreat. They found a different relationship   between   borehole water level and glacier flow speed than that plotted in Figure 3. Data from 1985, at the end of the advance, and from 1994, during the retreat, were distinct from one another and plotted below the data from 1980–82. By 1994, the variation in glacier velocity with water level was less than that of 1980–82 by about an order of magnitude. Iken and Truffer (1997) attributed this change in the relation between water level and sliding speed to a change in the nature of the subglacial drainage system over time, in which the connectivity between cavities had decreased. In effect, unconnected areas of the glacier bed buffered the velocity response to basal water pressure: high sliding   rates   were   inhibited   by   limited   water   access   to cavities, while the lowest sliding rates were precluded by isolated water pockets failing to drain.  LEGACY  Figure 4 presents a superficial analysis of the legacy of the works   summarized   above.   With   over   100   documented citations each, these papers have had a persistent influence over the years. The citing studies run the gamut from surging and tidewater glaciers (e.g. Kamb and others, 1985; Fowler, 1989; O’Neel and others, 2001; Fatland and Lingle, 2002; Vieli and others, 2004) to theoretical modelling of basal processes   (e.g.   Meyssonnier,   1989;   Zmitrowicz,   2003; Raymond   and   Gudmundsson,   2005;   Calvo   and   others, 2006; Sayag and Tziperman, 2009) to the interpretation of conditions   beneath   paleo   ice   sheets   (e.g.   Dardis   and Hanvey, 1994; Piotrowski and Tulaczyk, 1999; Brennand, 2000). Although the absolute number of citations within ice- sheet studies is still few, it is interesting to note that recent studies of Antarctic ice streams (e.g. Gray and others, 2005; Fricker and others, 2007; Joughin and others, 2009) and Greenland outlet glaciers (e.g. Joughin and others, 2008; Shepherd and others, 2009; Bartholomew and others, 2010) continue to draw upon these works. Attribution is possible for some of the inflections in the cumulative citation curves (Fig. 4). For example, the flurry of papers related to Variegated Glacier in Alaska (e.g. Kamb and others, 1985; Raymond and Malone, 1986) contributes to the rise in cumulative citations to Iken (1981) from 1985 to 1989. Output from the Haut Glacier d’Arolla (Switzer- land) project from 1996 to 1999 (e.g. Nienow and others, 1996; Harbor and others, 1997) is also visible in this record.  Fig. 4.

The Arolla project and numerous papers from Unteraar- gletscher (e.g. Gudmundsson and others, 1999; Schuler and others, 2004) contribute to the increase in citations to Iken and others (1983) between the mid-1990s and 2005, along with works from Trapridge Glacier (Yukon, Canada) and Bench Glacier (Alaska) among others. Citations to Iken and Bindschadler   (1986)   are   more   difficult   to   characterize, because they are broadly distributed across studies. How- ever, Figure 4 illustrates clearly that the relevance of this work has increased, rather than decreased, over time. Below I highlight a few of the research areas impacted by the works profiled   here.   This   review   is   far   from   comprehensive, drawing only upon a subset of works that cite one or more of the three papers.  Alpine glacier hydromechanics  Nowhere has the trio of works by Iken and colleagues been more   influential   than   in   the   study   of   alpine   glacier hydromechanics. These studies span a range of subjects from   ‘spring   events’   (e.g.   Anderson   and   others,   1999; Kavanaugh and Clarke, 2001; Mair and others, 2001) to jo ¨ kulhlaups (e.g. Bjo ¨ rnsson, 1998; Russell and others, 2006; Sugiyama and others, 2007) to glacier erosion (e.g. Hooke, 1991; Iverson, 1991; Harbor, 1992; Jamieson and others, 2008; MacGregor and others, 2009). Short-term to seasonal variations in velocity as observed by Iken and colleagues have been documented around the world on both temperate (e.g. Naruse and others, 1992; Raymond and others, 1995; Nienow and others, 2005; Purdie and others, 2008) and polythermal glaciers (e.g. Hooke and others, 1985; Jansson, 1995; Copland and others, 2003; Rippin and others, 2005; Bingham and others, 2006). A review of this work through the early 1990s is given by Willis (1995). Glacier   surges   furnish   a   dramatic   example   of   flow variations, and accordingly references to the work of Iken and colleagues can be found in the numerous papers related to the 1982–83 surge of Variegated Glacier (e.g. Kamb and others, 1985; Kamb and Engelhardt, 1987; Raymond and Harrison, 1988). Iken’s (1981) conceptualization of the sliding process is akin to Kamb’s (1987) linked cavity model used to explain the surge mechanism for Variegated Glacier. Many features of the antecedent mini-surges of 1978–81 were likened to observations from Findelengletscher and Unteraargletscher: transient uplift and subsidence of the glacier   surface,   propagating   waves   of   high   basal   water pressure and velocity and the correspondence of peak uplift rates with peak velocities (Kamb and others, 1985; Kamb and Engelhardt, 1987). A notable exception was the max- imum   in   observed   velocities   and   pressures,   the   latter exceeding the limiting pressure calculated by Iken (1981) at which sliding was predicted to become unstable. One explanation given for this was limited hydraulic connectivity during   mini-surges,   such   that   high-pressure   water   was confined to patches of the bed (Kamb and others, 1985). Hydromechanical events reminiscent of the observations on   Unteraargletscher   and   Findelengletscher   have   been documented on both temperate and polythermal glaciers from Haut Glacier d’Arolla in Switzerland (e.g. Mair and others, 2003) to John Evans Glacier in the Canadian High Arctic (e.g. Bingham and others, 2006). In some cases these events appear   to   be   driven   by   basal   water pressure   as interpreted by Iken and Bindschadler (1986) (e.g. Copland and   others,   2003),   while   in   others   the   water   pressure responds   to   a   predominantly   mechanical   forcing   (e.g. Kavanaugh   and   Clarke,   2001).   Basal   hydromechanical events can temporarily alter the force balance of the glacier (e.g. Howat and others, 2008), highlighting the limitations of the standard sliding law where the driving stress is assumed to be balanced locally by basal drag. In several cases Iken’s (1981) modelling results have been used specifically to explain the occurrence of peak horizontal velocities during rising water pressures (e.g. Nienow and others, 2005). For example,   Blake   and   others   (1994)   documented   diurnal peaks in sliding velocity, measured at the bed of Trapridge Glacier during rising water pressures measured in a nearby borehole. Fischer and Clarke (1997) proposed a stick–slip relaxation process to explain this, whereby elastic strain in the ice is released when rising basal water pressure causes episodic decoupling of the ice from the underlying till. Velocity perturbations driven by basal hydrology are not confined   to   land-terminating   glaciers   (e.g.   Meier   and others, 1994). For example, ONeel and others (2001) found flow speed near the terminus of LeConte Glacier, Alaska, to respond to surface melt and precipitation, in addition to ocean tides. Both Columbia Glacier in Alaska (Kamb and others,   1994)   and   Hansbreen   in   Spitsbergen   (Vieli   and others, 2004) exhibited velocity variations in response to surface water input as documented for many land-terminat- ing glaciers; however, velocity correlated better with water storage than pressure in both cases. Many glaciers such as Unteraargletscher in Switzerland (Sugiyama   and   Gudmundsson,   2004),   Storglacia ¨ren   in Sweden   (e.g.   Jansson,   1995)   and   Kennicott   Glacier   in Alaska (Bartholomaus and others, 2008) exhibit behaviour similar to that documented by Iken and others (1983) and Iken and Bindschadler (1986). Some studies, however, do not   find   a   straightforward   relationship   between   sliding speed   and   basal   effective   pressure   and   yet   are   not inconsistent with the observations of Iken and colleagues in other respects. For example, at Bench Glacier, Harper and others (2007) observed accelerated motion associated either   with   enhanced   ice–bed   separation   or   elevated hydraulic connectivity at the glacier bed, but unaccompa- nied by low effective pressures. MacGregor and others (2005) noted that the onset of the spring acceleration event at Bench Glacier coincided with a maximum in global englacial storage and that the propa- gation of the event was accompanied by a pattern of uplift and subsidence not unlike that observed by Iken and others (1983). Anderson and others (2004) used the ‘tilted staircase’ model of Iken (1981) to interpret a similar GPS dataset from Bench Glacier, where the relationship between calculated bed separation and sliding speed was explained in terms of cavity growth and collapse prior to the development of a channelized drainage system (see also Kessler and Ander- son, 2004). Using a sliding law of the general form proposed by Iken and Truffer (1997), Anderson and others (2004) inferred water pressures from their data that were naturally averaged over the relevant spatial scale. There is clearly a relationship between water and sliding at Bench Glacier, but one that does not lend itself easily to a functional description in terms of measured borehole water pressure. It would be raising a false dichotomy to suggest that the work of Iken and colleagues supports a relationship between sliding   and   water   pressure   to   the   exclusion   of   storage volume.   The   results   above   only   serve   to   reinforce   the significance of the connectedness of the drainage system (e.g. Iken and Truffer, 1997; Hanson and others, 1998), the  Flowers: Glacier hydromechanics – insights and legacy of Iken’s works   1073 https://doi.org/10.3189/002214311796406103 Published online by Cambridge University Press

scales   of   heterogeneity   over   which   glacier   processes naturally average (e.g. Kamb and others, 1994) and the relative influences of local vs non-local forcing (e.g. Rippin and others, 2005).  Ice-sheet hydromechanics  The extension of the early work of Iken and colleagues to the larger scale of the ice sheets is hardly surprising, given that they exported ideas about subglacial hydromechanics from the Swiss Alps to Greenland. Their work on Jakobshavn Isbræ (Iken and others, 1993; Funk and others, 1994; Lu ¨ thi and others, 2002) remains the only work to have documen- ted glacier-bed conditions through direct borehole obser- vations, which included evidence of an active subglacial drainage system. Iken and colleagues combined measure- ments and modelling (Iken and others, 1993; Funk and others, 1994; Lu ¨ thi and others, 2002) to infer a thick layer of rapidly deforming temperate ice at the base of Jakobshavn Isbræ. Their findings helped explain the fast flow of the ice stream and its lack of seasonal variation (Echelmeyer and Harrison, 1990). Since the early 2000s, there have been a number of studies documenting a distinct coupling between hydrology and dynamics particularly on land-terminating glaciers in Greenland. GPS data have revealed diurnal, weekly and seasonal variations in surface velocity along the western margin   of   the   ice   sheet   that   have   been   interpreted   as responses   to   variable   meltwater   input   to   the   bed   (e.g. Bartholomew and others, 2010). Relatively coherent weekly variability in surface velocity was found by Van de Wal and others (2008) over a 60 km stretch of the Kangerlussuaq (‘K’) transect, where the ice is 1000–1500 m thick. They related acceleration   on   this   timescale   to   the   rate   of   surface meltwater production, rather than the absolute volume of meltwater. This observation indirectly supports Iken’s (1981) conceptual model of sliding with cavitation. Shepherd and others (2009) documented diurnal vari- ations in horizontal flow speed and ice-surface elevation over several days in 2007 on the land-terminating Russell Glacier   in   western   Greenland.   They   associated   these variations   with   diurnal   meltwater   input,   while   they attributed   longer-term   flow   variations   to   lake   drainage events. On the basis of these observations, Shepherd and others   (2009)   proposed   that   alpine   glaciers   may   be   a reasonable analogue for Greenland in a warming climate. This suggestion seems to be confirmed by Bartholomew and   others   (2010)   for   another   transect   inland   from   the Russell Glacier terminus, where the data look much like those in Figure 2, velocity magnitudes excepted. Although some   of   the   outlet   glaciers   along   Greenland’s   western margin exhibit strong sliding responses to meltwater input reminiscent of alpine glaciers, they also appear to behave like alpine glaciers in adjusting their drainage systems to water flux (e.g. see Willis, 1995, for a review). This would explain their responsiveness to meltwater variability, rather than total volume in some cases (e.g. Van de Wal and others, 2008; Schoof, 2010). In Antarctica, discovery of saturated deformable sedi- ments beneath fast-flowing ice streams in the early 1980s (e.g.   Blankenship   and   others,   1986)   led   researchers   to consider the   influence of water pressure on   basal flow processes in an environment isolated from surface melt- water. Although the hard-bedded cavity-dominated drainage systems envisaged by Iken and colleagues would seem a far cry from the deforming beds of the Siple Coast ice streams, much of this work began by considering the fundamentals of sliding theory and observations from alpine glaciers (e.g. Bentley, 1987; Alley, 1989, 1993; Engelhardt and others, 1990; Harrison and others, 1993; Engelhardt and Kamb, 1997). Iken’s (1981) theoretical bound on basal shear stress surfaced in a recent study of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers in the mass-shedding Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Joughin and others (2009) noted a consistency between this bound and properties of the plastic-bed model they used which produced the best agreement between the modelled and measured extents of acceleration and thinning above the grounding line. Other recent Antarctic work harks back to the obser- vations of Iken and others (1983) by attributing short-term vertical deflections of the ice surface to the movement of subglacial water. Gray and others (2005) first observed this in Antarctica (cf. Fatland and Lingle, 2002) on Kamb and Bindschadler   Ice   Streams   using   interferometric   synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The short-term nature of the deflections and the spatial coincidence of uplift/subsidence with   subglacial   hydraulic   potential   minima   led   to   the interpretation of these data as reflecting transient water storage and release. Similar phenomena have since been interpreted from ice-surface deflections on other ice streams and   in   other   regions   of   Antarctica,   painting   a   highly dynamic picture of sub-ice-sheet drainage (e.g. Fricker and Scambos, 2009).  The sliding law  Adaptations to the classical form of the sliding law have been made, for example, to account for tangential forces (friction) at the bed (e.g. Morland, 1976b; Schweizer and Iken, 1992) and to allow for unstable sliding above a critical pressure less than the overburden (Iken and Truffer, 1997; Truffer and Iken, 1998). Much effort has also been devoted to understanding basal motion in the presence of uncon- solidated sediments (e.g. Alley, 1989; Iverson, 1999). An   important   recent   development   in   sliding   theory revisited Iken’s (1981) derivation of the ‘limiting’ or ‘critical’ pressure,   which   implies   that   basal   shear   stress   cannot exceed a maximum value for a given effective pressure and   bed   geometry.   Interpreted   physically,   cavity   water pressure limits the stress that can be concentrated on the stoss faces of bed obstacles as sliding with cavitation occurs. This is significant because it invalidates the traditional form of   u   ¼   C    p   = N   q   as a general sliding rule. In Iken’s (1981) original notation,   p 1   ¼   p 0      =   tan   (equation 2), where   p 1 is the limiting pressure,   p 0   the overburden pressure,      the basal shear stress and   the maximum slope of the stoss faces of bedrock obstacles with respect to the mean bed slope (Fig. 1). Rewriting gives         N   tan   . Schoof (2005) showed   that   this   relationship,   which   he   termed   ‘Iken’s bound’, could be extended to more realistic bed geometries and incorporated into a new sliding law (see also Fowler, 1987).   Gagliardini   and   others   (2007)   extended   Schoof’s (2005) work to nonlinear ice rheology and locally infinite bed slopes (i.e. bed obstacles that are perpendicular to mean bed   slope)   and   proposed   a   friction   law   of   the   form  = N   ¼   D  1 = n = ð 1   þ    m Þ 1 = n , where      ¼   u = ð D   n   N   n   A s Þ ,   u   is sliding speed,   n   is Glen’s exponent and   D ,   A s ,   m   and  =   ( m ) depend only on bed geometry if properly chosen. Although such laws are more complicated to implement  Flowers: Glacier hydromechanics – insights and legacy of Iken’s works 1074 https://doi.org/10.3189/002214311796406103 Published online by Cambridge University Press

than the traditional sliding relation, they are now being incorporated into numerical ice-flow models (e.g. Bueler and Brown, 2009; Pimentel and others, 2010).  CONCLUDING REMARKS  Iken and colleagues have contributed to our understanding of glacier hydromechanical processes from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. This places Iken among an elite few to have made seminal contributions in both glacio- logical   theory   and   field   observation.   She   is   uniformly praised by her colleagues as a scientist with strong physical insight   and   a   deep   understanding   of   the   processes   she studied. The research methods of the day were labour- intensive,   whether   through   the   use   of   punch   cards   for numerical modelling or manual theodolite measurements recorded in a field book to track sub-daily variations in glacier flow speed. Such circumstances required a degree of patience and perseverance perhaps less familiar to those of   us   in   the   cluster   computing   and   GPS   generation   of glaciology. The insights of Iken and her colleagues were therefore, in part, a product of extraordinary energy and endurance in the field. Subsisting on a simple diet featuring potatoes, oatmeal and a good supply of Swiss chocolate, Iken herself was a tireless field surveyor. This made possible the high temporal-resolution measurements that revealed such phenomena as glacier uplift and short-term accelera- tion. She had an appreciation for simple measurements throughout   her   career   and   was   accordingly   always equipped with a wristwatch, a multimeter and a roll or two of ‘Puma band’ (Swiss substitute for duct tape). Nearly three decades ago Iken (1981) showed us that there is a theoretical bound on the shear stress that can be supported by the glacier bed, a result that is just beginning to transform   the   way   we   represent   the   basal   boundary condition   in   ice-flow   models.   With   her   colleagues   she documented ice-surface uplift as a result of transient water storage at the bed and showed that maximum sliding speeds were achieved during cavity growth. These insights have been   used   to   interpret   short-term   velocity   fluctuations, among other data, from the Alps, Scandinavia, Svalbard, New   Zealand,   Kamchatka,   Alaska,   Yukon,   the   Arctic, Patagonia and the Himalaya as well as from past and present ice sheets. From surging and tidewater glaciers to the ice streams of Greenland and Antarctica, this work continues to provide   a   basis   for   interpreting   the   hydromechanical processes that operate under ice. Given the prominent role of dynamics in our current study of the cryosphere’s response to climate, we can expect the influence of this work to persist for years to come.
