ABSTRACT. The association between basal hydrology and glacier sliding has become nearly
synonymous with the early work of Almut lken and colleagues. Their research published in the Journal
of Glaciology from 1981 to 1986 made an indelible impact on the study of glacier hydromechanics by
documenting strong correlations between basal water pressure and short-term ice-flow variations. With
a passion for elucidating the physics of glacier-bed processes, lken herself made fundamental
contributions to our theoretical and empirical understanding of the sliding process. From the theoretical
bound on basal shear stress, to the inferences drawn from detailed horizontal and vertical velocity
measurements, the work of lken and colleagues continues to inform the interpretation of data from

alpine glaciers and has found increasing relevance to observations from the ice sheets.
