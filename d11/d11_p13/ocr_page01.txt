Volcanic tremor: Nonlinear excitation by fluid flow

Abstract. A nonlinear process analogous to the excitation mechanism of musical wind instru-
ments and human vocal cords can explain many characteristics of volcanic tremor, including (1)
periodic and “chaotic” oscillations, with peaked and irregular spectra respectively, (2) rapid pul-
sations in eruptions occurring at the same frequency as tremor, (3) systematic changes in tremor
amplitude as channel geometry evolves during an eruption, (4) the period doubling reported for
Hawaiian deep tremor, and (5) the fact that the onset of tremor can be either gradual or abrupt.
Volcanic “long-period” earthquakes can be explained as oscillations excited by transient distur-
bances produced by nearby earthquakes, fluid heterogeneity, or changes in channel geometry,
when the magma flow rate is too low to excite continuous tremor. A simple lumped-parameter
tremor model involving the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid through a channel with mov-
able elastic walls leads to a third-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For
different driving fluid pressures, numerical solutions exhibit steady flow, simple limit-cycle os-
cillations, a cascade of period-doubling subharmonic bifurcations, and chaotic oscillations con-
trolled by a strange attractor of Rossler type. In this model, tremor occurs most easily at lo-
cal constrictions, and fluid discharge is lower than would occur in unstable steady flow.
