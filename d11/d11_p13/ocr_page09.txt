Consider a constricted channel of length L = 10 m,
unpressurized thickness hg = 1 m, fluid density p = 2500 kg
m3 (2.5¢g cm 3), and viscosity 17 = 500 Pa s (5000 poise), a
value appropriate for basaltic melts [Murase and McBirney, e
1973]. The stiffness k of the walls can be estimated using oo
simple arguments from elasticity theory and the observed
shapes of exhumed dikes. Let w be the dimension of the
channel, measured in the z direction (Figure 8). This
dimension is much larger than the channel thickness h, and 0

Exhumed dikes typically have aspect ratios in the range from ts
