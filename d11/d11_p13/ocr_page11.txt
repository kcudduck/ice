Figure 11. Conditions for occurrence of tremor, from equation (22). Each curve corresponds to a state
of marginal instability (onset of tremor) for a fixed value of 3. The regions of instability (tremor) lie
above the curves. The parameters r;, 72, and r3 are dimensionless numbers defined in equations (23).
