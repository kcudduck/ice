Many characteristics of volcanic tremor can be explained

The tremor model proposed here does not take account
of acoustic resonance in the fluid within the channel. The
peaked spectra often interpreted as evidence of resonance are

which can be explained by nonlinear mechanisms not
involving acoustic resonance. Resonance probably occurs
and has significant quantitative effects on real tremor, but
the occurrence and qualitative features of tremor can be
explained without it.

co Acknowledgments. During this work, I had valuable
discussions with Jerry Eaton, and benefited greatly from
his extensive knowledge about Hawaiian volcanoes. Steve
McNutt’s knowledge about the rest of the world’s volcanoes,

0.5 and tremor in particular, were always generously shared
and valuable. Leif Wennerberg was a source of insight and
references on the subject of nonlinear dynamics. Bernard
