Figure 6. Chronology of seismic, tilt, and eruptive events associated with the September 13, 1977, east

phases indicate strong fountaining; open areas indicate less vigorous spattering activity. Summit tilt was
recorded by east-west component Ideal- Aerosmith tiltmeter at Uwekahuna. Harmonic tremor amplitudes
were measured hourly from records of stations HUL (east rift) and NPT (summit). The seismicity plot
shows hourly count of microearthquakes on east rift and south flank of Kilauea.
