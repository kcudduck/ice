JULIAN: VOLCANIC TREMOR—NONLINEAR EXCITATION BY FLUID FLOW 11,863
the superposition principle does not apply. We are thus N
forced to rely heavily on numerical integration, qualitative NL
phase space analysis, and approximate methods such as NN
linearized approximations valid only in limited regions of
phase space. Nevertheless, there are many common features
in the qualitative behavior of most nonlinear systems
[Feigenbaum, 1980]. In particular, dissipative nonlinear
oscillators that obey ordinary differential equations of third
or higher order can exhibit “chaotic” aperiodic oscillations
that are in many respects indistinguishable from a random
process. Most such systems undergo a transition from
regular to chaotic behavior in similar ways, through a
sequence of subharmonic bifurcations, often referred to as
the “period-doubling route to chaos” [Eckmann, 1981]. In
this process, a static equilibrium state becomes unstable as
nonlinear effects become stronger in response to changes in
some parameter (for example, the Reynolds number in fluid
flow or the Rayleigh number in convection), and limit-cycle
oscillations begin. Initially, these oscillations are simple, but
with increasing nonlinearity a sequence of subharmonics
appears, leading to longer-period and more complicated
oscillations, and then to chaotic oscillations.
Aki and Koyanagi [1981, p. 7096], in a study of deep
tremor in Hawaii, observed systematic variations in tremor
frequency that correspond closely to a period-doubling
sequence:
One of our most interesting findings is that the
period of tremor almost always changes with time
during a course of a tremor episode. A typical major
episode starts with high-frequency (5 ~ 10 Hz) with
moderate amplitude, grows into violent motion with
low frequency (1.5 ~3 Hz) dominating, and becomes
gradually weaker but with sporadic returns of high-
frequency vibrations near the end of the episode....
From a visual inspection, it appears that the period
doubles approximately in a step-like manner, rather
than gradually increasing.
Aki and Koyanagi [1981] attributed these observations to
discontinuous changes in the effective lengths of resonating
fluid-filled cracks, caused by the opening and closing
of interconnecting channels. Period doubling offers an
alternative explanation.
Even though tremor generation must be a nonlinear
process, and even though phenomena diagnostic of nonlinear
oscillation have been observed in tremor, it is not obvious
exactly what process is operating; several physically distinct
nonlinear mechanisms might be at work. The recently NN
recognized universal characteristics of nonlinear systems, NN
