expresses the balance between the viscous drag force and the
force from the reservoir pressure difference. Equation (15)

the variable vs; can be eliminated from equations (14) and

solvable analytically, but is easier to solve numerically. It can

Note greatly expanded scale for channel thickness (top). that small perturbations grow. To answer this question, I
