sequence of values of A, sampled at 0.005-s intervals, and for the future an investigation of this dependence.
I obtained a value of 1.93 + 0.01. This value is evidently
too low; the attractor’s dimension must be > 2.0. The . .
reason for the discrepancy is that the correlation method Evolution of Behavior
samples points along a dynamical orbit. This path does not Figure 16 summarizes the behavior of the model as the

frequently than others. Grassberger and Procaccia [1983] by numerically integrating the equations of motion (9)
argue that this sampling bias gives a value that is actually and (12) for 800 equally spaced values of p; and, for
more descriptive of the dynamics than the more formally each value, plotting the local maxima and minima of
defined Hausdorff dimension. The correlation dimension h(t), that is, the values on the Poincaré section A(t) =

observed time series, such as a seismogram. Obviously, the extrema for each time series; the first 100 are omitted
