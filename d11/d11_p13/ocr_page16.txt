> ; Y, Figure 13 shows spectra of the synthetic tremor signals in

] ~~ limit cycle, consists primarily of a narrow peak at a
N fundamental frequency fy = 5 Hz, and, because the signal
\ is not a perfect sinusoid, small peaks at harmonics of
150 \ this frequency. The second and third spectra correspond
to higher-order limit cycles and have additional peaks
corresponding to the subharmonics at fy/2 and fy/4 and
0.0 0.5 1.0 the higher harmonics of these frequencies. There is also
h,m more power in the harmonics of the fundamental. In the
final two cases, which correspond to chaotic behavior, the
\ subharmonic peaks have become broader and the spectra
h \ include a continuous component as well as peaks. In the
164.9 \ fourth spectrum, for the “noisy limit cycle,” all the peaks
\ from the “period four” limit cycle can still be seen, but
\ for fully developed chaos (fifth spectrum) only those peaks
\ representing the simple limit cycle are resolvable. For still
NL more chaotic cases, even these peaks disappear in the
- \ continuous “noise.”

e Ju | Observational Tests of the Model
\ The tremor-generation mechanism proposed here can be
\ tested in several ways. Direct observations of magmatic fluid
164.7 NY | flow made during eruptions provide opportunities to obtain
\ several kinds of data. Pulsation rates of lava fountains and
\ gas emissions can be compared with tremor frequencies.
\ Observed fluid properties, flow speeds, and channel sizes
can be used to predict tremor amplitudes, frequencies,
0.888 0.889 0.890 0.801 0.892 and waveforms. Qualitative observations of this kind have
h, m already been made in the early stages of Hawaiian-type
eruptions: as “curtains of fire” change to lava fountains
164.780 - and vents evolve from tabular to less compliant cylindrical
* shapes, tremor amplitudes are observed to decrease greatly.
C \ These changes in channel geometry should also cause
| systematic increases in tremor frequency. (Quantitative
, prediction of these changes will require that the tremor
. model be extended to cylindrical geometry.)
\ The tremor model predicts that long-period earthquakes
_ should have simple source time functions resembling damped
7 IN sinusoids, like the synthetic time series in Figure 10. In
