Tremor is widely observed in places such as the rift zones
of Hawaiian volcanoes. Geophysical measurements [Hill and
Zucca, 1987] and studies of exhumed rift zones on the older
islands | Walker, 1987] show that rift zones consist not of
flows but of massive dike complexes with dimensions of the
order of kilometers. Mechanisms such as the one proposed
by Omer [1950] could not operate in such places.

At depths of several kilometers, gases such as steam or

the compressibility of steam at 1000°C is about 1.5x1073
