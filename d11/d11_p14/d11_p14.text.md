                                                 Acoustic cavitation bubbles are known to exhibit highly nonlinear
                                             and unpredictable chaotic dynamics. Their inevitable role in appli-
                                             cations like sonoluminescence, sonochemistry and medical procedures
                                             suggests that their dynamics be controlled. Reducing chaotic oscilla-
                                             tions could be the first step in controlling the bubble dynamics by in-
                                             creasing the predictability of the bubble response to an applied acous-
                                             tic field. One way to achieve this concept is to perturb the acoustic
                                             forcing. Recently, due to the improvements associated with using dual
                                             frequency sources, this method has been the subject of many studies
                                             which have proved its applicability and advantages. Due to this rea-
                                             son, in this paper, the oscillations of a spherical bubble driven by a
                                             dual frequency source, were studied and compared to the ones driven
                                             by a single source. Results indicated that using dual frequency had
                                             a strong impact on reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular ones.
                                             The governing parameters influencing its dynamics are the secondary
                                             frequency and its phase difference with the fundamental frequency.
                                             Also using dual frequency forcing may arm us by the possibility of
                                             generating oscillations of desired amplitudes. To our knowledge the
                                             investigation of the ability of using a dual frequency forcing to control
                                             chaotic oscillations are presented for the first time in this paper.

                                                                                1
1    Introduction
Cavitation bubbles, driven in motion by an acoustic field, are the example
of highly nonlinear forced oscillators. The study of their behavior, recently,
has attracted lots of attention and it is shown that this phenomenon exhibit
highly nonlinear and complex dynamics both experimentally [1, 2, 3] and
numerically [4, 5, 6, 7]. Besides their complex behavior, acoustically driven
bubbles have lots of advantageous applications in material science, sonolu-
minescence and sonochemistry [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], sonofusion [13] and medical
procedures such as: lithotripsy, diagnostic imaging, drug and gene delivery,
increasing membrane permeability, opening blood brain barrier and high in-
tensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) surgery [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In all of these
applications a conventional single frequency acoustic source has been used
to provide the bubble oscillations. As an alternative to this conventional
approach recently using dual frequency sources has lured a great amount of
attention in order to improve the outcome of the applications involving acous-
tic cavitation. Dual frequency has been used to enhance sonoluminescence
phenomenon [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] resulting in an increase in the light emis-
sion up to 300 percent. In ultrasound imaging, it introduces a robust back
scatter of ultrasound agents even at low intensity frequencies, which can be
optimized up to 200 percent brighter as compared to single frequency employ-
ment [24]. In sonochemistry, using two harmonics has shown to increase the
energy efficacy and enhance sonochemical reactors function [25, 26, 27, 28].
In therapeutic applications such as sonodynamic therapy and HIFU, using
a dual frequency source is shown to greatly increase the treatment efficacy
[29, 30, 31, 32]. In the above mentioned applications, an optimum employ-
ment of bubbles suggests that chaotic oscillations be reduced, because when
the bubble motion gets chaotic, its behavior becomes unpredictable and very
hard to control. Therefor, reducing chaotic oscillations can be the first step
in precisely controlling the bubble dynamics and can provide more beneficial
outcomes.
In applications involving cavitation, the parameters like the viscosity, surface
tension or the diameter of the bubble are determined by the media and type
of the application. Therefore, in order to carry out control strategies in the
system, the only remaining parameter that can be dealt with, is the per-
turbation of the forcing term. As mentioned using dual frequency sources is
practical and has been proved to have many advantages in an increasing num-
ber of applications. For this reason, in order to stabilize the bubble motion,

                                       2
we perturb the bubble single frequency forcing by introducing a secondary
frequency drive to the system. In this respect firstly, through applying the
methods of chaos physics, nonlinear dynamics of a spherical cavitation bubble
driven by a single frequency source was studied in this paper. The consid-
ered control parameters were the applied pressure, frequency and the bubble
initial radius. An evaluation upon the stabilizing effect of a dual frequency
source on chaotic oscillations was carried out. For a fixed initial frequency,
different values of the secondary frequency along with its phase difference
with the fundamental were studied. These were done through plotting and
analyzing the bifurcation diagrams and the lyapunov exponent spectra. The
reason for using these analysis is that in the absence of any direct and reliable
mathematical methods, bifurcation diagrams and largest lyapunov exponent
spectra are very useful by providing a precise view on the dynamical behavior
of the system over a wide range of control parameters. They can be used as
powerful tools to determine suitable values for the secondary frequency and
the phase difference. For this reason we analyzed the consequences before
and after applying the introduced method through plotting the bifurcation
diagrams, lyapunov exponent spectra and time series of the bubble.
Results were promising as they indicated an accessible stabilizing role of a
dual frequency source on chaotic oscillations. The effective control param-
eters were found to be the value of the secondary frequency and the phase
difference.


2     The Bubble model
The bubble model used for the numerical simulation is derived in [4] and
is a modification of the bubble model formulated by Prosperetti[33] from
Keller-Miksis bubble equation[34]. The reason for using this model is that
it generated results in good agreement with those obtained by solving the
full partial differential equations of fluid dynamics and is suitable for a wide
range of amplitudes of oscillations [35]. It is is given by (1):

where ν1 is the frequency of the driving sound field and Pa is the amplitude
of the driving pressure.
For a dual frequency source:

                      A = Pa [sin (2πν1 t) + sin (2πν2 t + α)]                (4)

where ν2 is the secondary driving frequency and α is the phase difference.


3      Results and discussion
3.1      Bubble dynamics driven by a single frequency
The dynamics of the bubble driven by a single frequency source were stud-
ied numerically by solving equation (1). The bifurcation diagram and the
lyapunov exponent spectrum of a bubble with initial radius of 10µm were
sketched versus pressure and frequency in a wide range. Figures 1a − b
show the bifurcation diagram and lyapunov spectrum of a bubble driven by
500KHz of frequency versus pressure within 10KP a − 2MP a. Figure 1a
demonstrates the highly nonlinear complex dynamics of the bubble through-
out the pressure increase, which includes stable period one, period two, four,
eight, chaos and then period three, period six and once more chaos. Also
there are two windows of complex periodic behavior inside the second chaotic
domain. Figure 1b shows its corresponding lyapunov exponent which con-
firms figure 1a substantiating chaotic behavior by positive values and stable
periodic oscillations by negative ones.

                                          4
Figures 2a−b show the bifurcation diagram and lyapunov spectrum of a bub-
ble when driven by a pressure source of 500KP a versus frequency in the range
of 100KHz − 2MHz. We can perceive in figure 2a intermittent occurrence
of chaotic and stable behaviors in bubble oscillations during frequency in-
crease. The transitions from stable to chaotic oscillations are through period
doubling bifurcations. The last transition to stable everlasting oscillations
occurred through a saddle node bifurcation after an inverse period doubling.
As a quantitative criterion for the comportment illustrated in figure 2a, the
lyapunov exponent spectrum was sketched in figure 2b.
The significant undesirable behavior outlined in figures 1 and 2 is oscillations
which are chaotic. To avoid these unwanted dynamical effects, it is necessary
to carry out control strategies in the system. To achieve this objective we
propose a method called ”Dual frequency technique”. In the stated method
we introduced a secondary frequency employment along with the primary
driving frequency source.
In this technique, the effect of not only the secondary frequency but also
its phase difference with the basic frequency must be concomitantly taken
into consideration to get the desirable outcome. More explanation is going
to be put forward in this paper. In order to streamline the manifestation
of the method efficacy on chaotic behaviors, some chaotic zones have been
arbitrarily chosen to be exposed to the secondary frequency. For the asso-
ciated zones the dynamical behavior of the bubble was analyzed before and
after control. This is done through analyzing its bifurcation diagram and the
corresponding lyapunov spectrum. Also time series of the normalized radius
of the bubble are presented in order to reveal the stabilizing effect on the
oscillations of the bubble in certain values of the control parameter.



3.2    Possibility of controlling chaotic oscillations using
       a dual frequency forcing
Starting with a completely chaotic zone for a single cavitation bubble when
the control parameter is pressure, figure 3 has been presented. The funda-
mental frequency is 200KHz for a bubble of initial radius of 10µm. Figure
3a displays the status prior to applying the technique; while figure 3b exhibits
the same system when a secondary frequency of 500KHz was applied with
the phase difference of pi/2 with the primer one. It is considerable in figure


                                       5
3b that after applying the secondary frequency, no chaotic behavior occurred
within 1.55 − 2MP a, which used to appear in the system driven by a single
frequency. The according lyapunov spectra have been outlined in figure 4.
The dashed line corresponds to the situation in the absence of the secondary
frequency. The solid line corresponds to the secondary frequency employed
situation. This figure indicates a significant abatement of the lyapunov expo-
nent from positive values to negative ones after the proposed technique was
engaged. The controlling phenomenon has also been granted by plotting the
normalized bubble oscillations versus time in a certain value of the pressure
before and after control in figure 5.
In order to show the capability of the proposed method to control the chaotic
oscillation versus other parameters, we have plotted the bifurcation diagram
of the bubble versus its initial radius, before and after control, in figures
6a − b. The frequency and the amplitude of the driving force are 300KHz
and 1MP a, respectively. A secondary frequency of 1MHz is introduced
while the phase difference is pi/4. Results indicate its controlling effect by
reducing the chaotic oscillations to regular behaviors of period 4 −→ period
3 −→ period 8 through bubbling bifurcation and again, period 4 in the ini-
tial radius of the range 37.3µm-39µm. Also the normalized oscillations of a
bubble with 37.6µm, before and after applying the secondary frequency, are
shown in figures 7a − b.



3.3    Effects of the phase difference on the dynamics of
       a dual frequency driven bubble
In bubble cavitation applications, the optimization of the control parameters
like viscosity and surface tension is mainly imposed by the media. Other
control parameters like pressure, initial frequency and initial radius are de-
termined by the sort of application. In dual frequency method the secondary
frequency and the phase difference can be conveniently dealt with to reach a
proper choice.
Two different circumstances were considered to understand their role:
1. Under a constant secondary frequency, its phase difference with the pri-
mary frequency is varied.
2. The amplitude of the secondary frequency is varied while the phase dif-
ference is held constant.


                                      6
For the purpose of studying the effect of phase difference the chaotic dynam-
ics of a bubble with 4µm of initial radius and 1MHz fundamental frequency,
were studied in the range of 1−3MP a of pressure. Figure 8a shows the result-
ing bifurcation diagram. It shows that the bubble dynamics is first chaotic,
then becomes of period four regular oscillations and each of them undergoes a
period doubling bifurcation and again chaotic oscillations occur in the range
of 1.6−3MP a. A secondary frequency with the value of 1.5MHz was applied
concomitant with the fundamental. The phase differences of pi/6, pi/2 and
3pi/4 were applied. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are presented in fig-
ures 8b − 8d respectively. As seen in figure 8b, by applying a phase difference
of pi/6 a stable region appeared in the range of about 1.6 − 2MP a which
were chaotic before applying the secondary frequency. When we applied the
phase difference of pi/2 (figure8c) the bubble exhibited stable period four
oscillations in the range of 1 − 1.6MP a. As seen the oscillations are stable
in the range of about 1 − 1.3MP a of pressure which they were chaotic before
applying the technique. Figure 8d illustrates the case of applying the 3pi/4 of
phase difference. When compared with figure 8a we see that a stable region
is formed in the range of about 2 − 2.5MP a. This domain was completely
chaotic prior to applying the dual frequency method. Also it should be noted
that the stable region in the bifurcation diagram of the bubble driven by a
single frequency source may become chaotic after applying the secondary fre-
quency. This is obvious in figures 8b and 8d.
In summary it is seen that phase difference had a distinguishable impact on
the dual frequency bubble dynamics. Different stable regions appeared cor-
responding to typical phase differences. This suggests certain phase values
can be applied to control chaotic regions of interest.

3.4    Effects of the secondary frequency on the dynamics
       of a dual frequency driven bubble
In order to study the impact of the value of the secondary frequency on the
bubble dynamics, the chaotic oscillations of the bubble in the previous part
(figure 8a) were chosen. The phase difference was held constant with the
value of pi/3 while the secondary frequency was 500KHz, 800KHz, 2MHz
and 3MHz. The resulting bifurcation diagrams are presented in figures
9a − d, respectively. Comparing with figure 8a using a secondary frequency
of 500KHz (figure 9a) has stabilized the first chaotic region in the range


                                      7
of about 1 − 1.3MP a to period four regular behavior. There are two small
other stable regions in about 1.6 − 1.7MP a and 2.5 − 2.6MP a. As seen in
figure 9b, a small domain of regular behavior around 1.2MP a is created when
applying the value of 800KHz for the secondary frequency. Also there is an-
other stable region in the range of about 1.9 − 2MP a. Both of these domains
were chaotic before applying the 800KHz of secondary frequency. Figure 9c
shows the bifurcation diagram when the secondary frequency is 2MHz. A
vast region of stable oscillations is generated about 1.9−2.9MP a of pressure.
The oscillations are of different periods and some bubbling bifurcations and
period doublings are seen. There are other stable domains created in the
range of about 1.1 − 1.3MP a and between 1.3 − 1.4MP a of pressure. Em-
ploying the secondary frequency of 3MHz (figure 9d), extremely stabilizes
the chaotic oscillations in the range of approximately 1.8−2.3MP a to period
one oscillations. Also another stable region is generated about 2.6MP a of
pressure.
In summary we see that like the influence of phase difference, the value of
the secondary frequency has a strong impact on the dynamics of a dual fre-
quency driven bubbles. Results show that by applying certain values for the
secondary frequency we may be capable of controlling the chaotic oscilla-
tions in different regions of interest. Combining the suitable choice for the
secondary frequency and the phase difference can help us greatly for this
purpose.

3.5    Effects of the secondary frequency and phase dif-
       ference on the oscillation amplitudes
As it was seen the maximum oscillation amplitudes may change when apply-
ing the dual frequency technique. In order to study the effects of variations
in frequency and phase difference on the oscillations amplitude, firstly in fig-
ure 10a we have plotted time series of the normalized chaotic oscillations of
a bubble with initial radius of 50µm driven by 300KHz of frequency and
1MP a of pressure. Then the proposed method is applied and the obtained
results are presented in figure 10b − i. In the left column the phase differ-
ence is varied for a fixed secondary frequency and in the right column the
frequency is varied for a constant value of phase difference. Results demon-
strate that certain values of phase difference and secondary frequency may
stabilize the behavior whereas it can renovate chaos as observed in figures


                                       8
10c and 10h. In figure 10 except for 10c and 10h the oscillations have become
stable. It is also seen that this technique may arm us by the possibility to
provide oscillations of desired amplitude.



4    Conclusion
The dynamics of an acoustically driven gas bubble was studied applying the
method of chaos physics. Results indicated its rich nonlinear dynamics with
respect to variations in the control parameters of the system. A method
based on applying a dual frequency source is proposed. Simulation results
demonstrated that the proposed procedure may be able to achieve the con-
trol objective. This is possible through choosing appropriate values of the
secondary frequency and its phase difference with initial one.
