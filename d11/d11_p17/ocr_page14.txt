extrapolating to time (t) = 0. In Table 2, calculated power in function of the nominal
irradiation power. The transmitted energy in the system increases, then raised
disruption caused by ultrasonic intensity reduces the lifetime of transient bubbles
and cavitation effects are more evident. These effects allow tuning the energy
supplied to the system during the synthesis in order to control GNPs properties.
The obtained values of the primary sonochemical effects in the solution are similar
and lower than the irradiation conditions used In food industry applications [54].

The chemical effects In the proposed GNPs ultrasound assisted synthesis can be
explained as follows. During the reduction there will be at least four different anions
present in the reaction medium: gold(lI1) chloride; (AuClsâ„¢); citrate; chloride; and
hydroxide anions [55]. Following mechanism outlines, an important factor Is
competitive and preferential adsorption of AuCls~ ions instead of citrate ions on the
surface of formed seeds [56]. The AuCls~ cannot to be adsorbed as a charged ion:
either counter-ion complexation occurs or one of the CI~ ligands Is displaced when
adsorption takes place, effectively adsorbing as AuClz [57]. To the previous
mechanism can be added that, effective absorption of ultrasonic energy can be
achieved If GNPs are in resonance with the ultrasound. Furthermore surface
potential of the pure gold surface [58], becomes more negative with increasing pH
[55]. Then, is possible improve the control of the homogeneity, size and shape of
