Ultrasound processing is an environment-friendly, safe and inexpensive technology
[21], used as a versatile tool in a wide range of scientific and technological
applications, for instance: biology [22], chemistry [23], physics [24], medicine [25],
material science [26], and industrial applications [27-30]. Nanomaterials can be
obtained and modified using ultrasonic irradiation to assist synthetic methods In
agueous solution [31]. The acoustic cavitation produced by ultrasonic irradiation In
water generates transient bubbles, within which, different physical and chemical
phenomena generated by their implosion play an important role in the formation of
nanostructures [32].
Ultrasound irradiation can produce the conditions for chemical agent-free reduction
of gold ions [33] and noble metal nanoparticles formation in different morphologies
[34]. Combining the ultrasound physical effects such as: cavitation, arises of
temperature and local pressure differentials (primary sonochemistry) with chemical
reactions promoted by hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals produced by sonolysis (Eg.
1) (secondary sonochemistry).

The bubbles volume and life cycle are determined by ultrasonic power intensity in
agueous media [34]. From its formation, growth, and final implosion as result of
their collapse, they induce hot spots production with internal local temperatures up
to thousands of K and high pressure differentials [35]. At these conditions, the
reactants have intensive interactions in extremely short time-lapse, cavitation
events results in heating and cooling rates of more than 10°°K s* and
sonocrystallization can be improved [36]. Secondary sonochemistry effects are
dominant at 20-100 kHz ultrasound frequencies with a higher level of transient
cavitation, whereas chemical effects are dominant in range of 200-500 kHz due to
the generation of a large number of active bubbles [37].
Scientific reports have analyzed the effects of the sonochemical parameters in
GNPs synthesis; i.e. frequency [38], low irradiation power (<100 W), and stabilizing
compounds concentration [39]. However, ultrasonic irradiation power is the main
