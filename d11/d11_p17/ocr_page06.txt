of cavitation and radical formation in the aqueous solution volume, which acting
together with sodium citrate for improved reduction of chloroauric acid. The SPR
formation and localization inspected by UV-Vis band around 520 to 560 nm of 10
minutes aliquots confirms the reduction of Au*3 to Au® ions and the subsequent Au
clusters formation. The obtained GNPs were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) to observe their size, shape and Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) of high-resolution images revealed their FCC structure. These
results show the influence of ultrasound in the GNPs production, increasing
Irradiation power as a strategy to controlled size, shape, and SPR in a simple way
and optimized time.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials and equipment
Reagents used were Tetrachloroauric(lll) acid (HAuCls 2 99%, Sigma Aldrich),
Trisodium citrate dihydrate (CsHsNazO7 « 2H20, = 99%, Sigma Aldrich) and
deionized water (18MQ, < 4.3 uS/cm, Millipore). Ultrasonic Homogenizer 300VT
BioLogics, Inc. was used with titanium sonotrode (diameter=9.5 mm, length=108
mm). Temperature increasing was detected using an immersed thermocouple (K
Type) In the irradiated solutions. The pH values were measured using HANNA
Instruments, HI-2210-02 Bench Top pH Meter with glass electrode. UV-Vis spectra
were obtained from a Thermo Scientific UV-Vis GENESYS 10S
spectrophotometer. TEM observation and HRTEM images were performed in an
image—corrected FEI Titan at 300 kV. FFT images were obtained by using Gatan
Digital Micrograph software.
2.2 Sonochemical synthesis of gold nanoparticles
Following the Turkevich—Frens method [9], 50 mL of chloroauric acid (HAuUCl4),
0.025 mM was poured into a 100 mL beaker (Borosilicate glass), which was added
1 mL of 1.5% (w/v) aqueous solution of trisodium citrate (NasCt) under ultrasonic
irradiation at 60, 150 and 210 W for one hour, at room temperature. The
NasCt/HAuUCI4 ratio used in the three samples was 3:1 (w/v). Samples were labeled
