specific interval. It can be Interesting for biomedical applications based in the
GNPs radiation absorption such as photo thermal therapies.

Fig. 2. GNPs growth dynamics at different irradiation powers (a) 60 W, (b) 150 W, and (c)
210 W monitoring surface plasmon resonance in UV-Vis spectra, showing the relationship
among absorbance, wavelength and synthesis time. (d) shows the proposed evolution of
dispersion and size of GNPs face-centered cubic (FCC), (e) summarizes the FWHM
evolution of SRP bands, narrowing can be achieve in 20 minutes at 210 W, and (f) LSPR
and bathochromic shift shows the influence of ultrasound power increasing in the optical
properties of GNPs.
3.2 Structural characterization
Representative TEM images of GNPs samples are shown in Fig. 3. The particle
size distribution of 60 W sample was 16+3 nm. In this case, large aggregates and
Isolated nanoparticles were visible, matching with UV-Vis spectra predictions. The
GNPs crystalline structure was defined by HRTEM as faceted tetrakis hexahedron
polyhedral arrangement (Fig. 3b), while the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c) confirms the complex array. The 150 sample (Fig. 3d)
reveals triakis icosahedron crystallization and reduced polydispersion (16+1.6 nm).
