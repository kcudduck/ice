The effect of three nominal ultrasound (20kHz) irradiation powers: 60, 150 and 210 W has been analyzed as size and shape control parameter. The GNPs colloidal solutions were obtained from chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4 ) and trisodium citrate (C 6 H 5 Na   3 O   7   ‚Ä¢ 2H 2 O) under continuous irradiation for 1 hour without any additional heat or stirring. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was monitored in the UV-Vis spectra every 10 minutes to found the optimal time for localized SPR wavelength ( ùúÜùúÜ   LSPR ) and the 210 sample procedure reduces the   ùúÜùúÜ   LSPR   localization to 20 minutes, while 150 and 60 samples show   ùúÜùúÜ   LSPR   in 60 minutes. The nucleation and growth of GNPs showed changes in

The results showed quasi ‚àí spherical GNPs as pentakis dodecahedron ( Œª LSPR =560 nm), triakis icosahedron ( Œª LSPR =535 nm), and tetrakis hexahedron ( Œª LSPR = 525 nm) in a size range from 12-16 nm. Chemical effects of ultrasound irradiation were suggested in the disproportionation process, electrons of AuCl 2 ‚àí  are rapidly exchanged through the gold surface. After AuCl 4 ‚àí   and Cl ‚àí   are desorbed and a complex tetrachloroaurate is recycled for the two-electron reduction by citrate, aurophilic interaction between complexes AuCl 2 ‚àí , electrons exchange and gold seeds, the deposition of new gold atoms on the surface promoting the growth of GNPs. These mechanisms are enhanced by the extraordinary effects of ultrasound such as the cavitation effects and transmitted energy into the solution. These results show the that the plasmonic response from our nanoparticles can be tuned using a simple methodology with minimum infrastructure requirements. Moreover, the production method could be easily scalable to meet industrial manufacture needs.  Keywords:   Sonochemistry, gold nanoparticles, irradiation power.

3  1. Introduction  The gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been studied as plasmonic materials for their application in biomedical field. Some of these applications involves photo-thermal cancer treatment agents [1], molecular labeling [2], radiotherapies [3], drug delivery systems [4], and optical sensing devices [5]. The current demand for well-defined GNPs properties is creating the cutting edge methods toward more efficient, safe and economically for nanoparticle manufacture [6]. Colloidal GNPs have been easily synthesized and size and shape controlled by chemical methods [7]. Turkevich   et al.   developed a synthetic route to obtain colloidal gold nanoparticles (GNPs) based on hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl 4 ) reduction from citric acid and sodium citrate as reducing agents in boiling water, under vigorous stirring conditions [8]. The advantages of sodium citrate salt in the synthesis are: it acts as a reducing and stabilizing agent, also forms a buffer in aqueous solution avoiding abrupt pH modifications in the reaction. Tuerkevich-Frens method allows preparing GNPs with different sizes by modifying gold ions/citrate ratios for controlled nucleation velocity and steric surface can be achieved for colloidal stability and biological functionalization [9-11].  A challenge in the chemical synthetic routes for GNPs manufacture is to control the primary morphology, particle size distribution, crystalline structure in a simple way, and retain their properties along time [12]. Several strategies have done to control these properties using surfactants [13], dispersing agents [14], and biological compounds [15]. Likewise, other approaches include electromagnetic irradiation, such as microwaves [16], ultraviolet (UV) light [17], electron beam [18], and gamma-ray [19] to obtain GNPs without using reducing agents, and their sterilization by means of a one-step process were also developed [20]. The interaction between irradiation energy and the irradiated solution has been the key to control the properties of GNPs by kinetics reaction manipulation.   However, high energy is needed for ionizing those systems, additionally, complicated experimental setups are required, and making manufacture non-rentable for industrial production.

4  Ultrasound processing is an environment-friendly, safe and inexpensive technology [21], used as a versatile tool in a wide range of scientific and technological applications, for instance: biology [22], chemistry [23], physics [24], medicine [25], material science [26], and industrial applications [27-30]. Nanomaterials can be obtained and modified using ultrasonic irradiation to assist synthetic methods in aqueous solution [31]. The acoustic cavitation produced by ultrasonic irradiation in water generates transient bubbles, within which, different physical and chemical phenomena generated by their implosion play an important role in the formation of nanostructures [32].  Ultrasound irradiation can produce the conditions for chemical agent-free reduction of gold ions [33] and noble metal nanoparticles formation in different morphologies [34]. Combining the ultrasound physical effects such as: cavitation, arises of temperature and local pressure differentials (primary sonochemistry) with chemical reactions promoted by hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals produced by sonolysis (Eq. 1) (secondary sonochemistry).  H 2 O + ultrasound ‚Üí e aq ‚àí , H 3 O   + , H ‚Ä¢ , H 2 , OH ‚Ä¢ , H 2 O   2   (1)  The bubbles volume and life cycle are determined by ultrasonic power intensity in aqueous media [34]. From its formation, growth, and final implosion as result of their collapse, they induce hot spots production with internal local temperatures up to thousands of K and high pressure differentials [35]. At these conditions, the reactants have intensive interactions in extremely short time-lapse, cavitation events results in heating and cooling rates of more than 10   10   K s -1   and sonocrystallization can be improved [36].   Secondary sonochemistry effects are dominant at 20‚Äì100 kHz ultrasound frequencies with a higher level of transient cavitation, whereas chemical effects are dominant in range of 200‚Äì500 kHz due to the generation of a large number of active bubbles [37].  Scientific reports have analyzed the effects of the sonochemical parameters in GNPs synthesis; i.e. frequency [38], low irradiation power (<100 W), and stabilizing compounds concentration [39]. However, ultrasonic irradiation power is the main

The GNPs properties are sensitive to size and shape modifications and their adequate control during the synthesis is crucial for their implementation as tool in early disease detection [ 42 ] and multifunctional nanomedicines for cancer therapy [ 43 ].  Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the surface energy of GNPs decreases by increasing cluster size at 0 K, but it is increased at higher temperatures [44]. The self-assembly of molecular polyhedra into complex structures can modify the shape of Au   0   atoms polyhedral in a face-centered cubic (FCC). The FCC clusters have shown different optical behavior depending on the facet structure, the crystal system arrangement is crucial in the modification of ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) interactions. Au dodecahedron and icosahedron exhibit bathochromic shifted and broader surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks, whereas the quasi ‚àí spherical shape of the truncated octahedron leads to a similar optical response as a perfect sphere, with a slight bathochromic shifting and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [45]. Electron diffraction patterns observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization have confirmed the facet orientations and the FCC structure to form exotic solids [46]. An experimental survey on the Au clusters synthesis reported their evolution in different solids, controlling the cluster arrangement is possible to influence the optical response [47].  In this work, the variation of ultrasonic power from 60 to 210 W nominal values in the synthesis of GNPs using an ultrasonic probe at 20 kHz of frequency was studied. The experimental methodology was designed to observe the primary and secondary sonochemical effects monitoring temperature every 10 minutes and final pH differential after 60 minutes of irradiation to determine the macroscopic effects

The SPR formation and localization inspected by UV-Vis band around 520 to 560 nm of 10 minutes aliquots confirms the reduction of Au +3   to Au   0   ions and the subsequent Au clusters formation. The obtained GNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to observe their size, shape and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of high-resolution images revealed their FCC structure. These results show the influence of ultrasound in the GNPs production, increasing irradiation power as a strategy to controlled size, shape, and SPR in a simple way and optimized time.  2. Materials and methods  2.1 Materials and equipment  Reagents used were Tetrachloroauric(III) acid (HAuCl 4   ‚â• 99%, Sigma Aldrich),  Trisodium citrate dihydrate (C 6 H 5 Na   3 O   7   ‚Ä¢   2H 2 O, ‚â• 99%, Sigma Aldrich) and  deionized water (18M Œ© , ‚â§ 4.3 ŒºS/cm, Millipore). Ultrasonic Homog enizer 300VT BioLogics, Inc. was used   with titanium sonotrode (diameter=9.5 mm, length=108 mm). Temperature increasing was detected using an immersed thermocouple (K Type) in the irradiated solutions. The pH values were measured using HANNA Instruments, HI-2210-02 Bench Top pH Meter with glass electrode. UV ‚àí Vis spectra were obtained from a Thermo Scientific UV ‚àí Vis GENESYS 10S spectrophotometer. TEM observation and HRTEM images were performed in an image ‚àí corrected FEI Titan   3   at 300 kV. FFT images were obtained by using Gatan Digital Micrograph software.  2.2 Sonochemical synthesis of gold nanoparticles  Following the Turkevich ‚àí Frens method [9], 50 mL of chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4 ), 0.025 mM was poured into a 100 mL beaker (Borosilicate glass), which was added 1 mL of 1.5% (w/v) aqueous solution of trisodium citrate (Na   3 Ct) under ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 150 and 210 W for one hour, at room temperature. The Na   3 Ct/HAuCl 4   ratio used in the three samples was 3:1 (w/v). Samples were labeled

Processing of GNPs, shows nucleation and growth promoted by sonochemical effect in ultrasonic irradiation in aqueous solution.  2.3 Characterization  The UV ‚àí Vis spectra (350 to 1000 nm) were collected   from 3 mL aliquots every 10 minutes and measured in a quartz cuvette for monitoring the SRP bathochromic shift during GNPs nucleation and growth. Samples were supported on Lacey copper grids by dropping a diluted sample in water and drying in a vacuum for 24 hours for TEM observation. During the colloid synthesis temperature readings every 10 minutes were made for all experiments. The pH was measured after and before of ultrasonic irradiation.  3. Results and Discussion  3.1 Optical characterization  After performing the ultrasound radiation, the colloidal solutions showed different colors, violet for 60 W and ruby-red for 150 and 210 W samples. Figs. 2a ‚àí c shows

# Page 8

8  the UV ‚àí Vis bathochromic shifting observed in the spectra, as a function of time reaction for all synthesized samples. The GNPs sample at 60 W had a limited intensity from absorption due to nucleation and growth, this effect is associated with large Au clusters formation, but does not contribute to the absorption band signal. The spectra revealed a broadband localized at 650 nm after 60 minutes of irradiation (Fig. 2d). The hypochromic shift   at   Œª   SRP =   520 nm was associated with small GNPs signal and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value of 2.21 eV probes the formation of large aggregates. The broad full width at half maximum (FWHM) (114 nm) of the SRP band was associated with the multiple twinned GNPs in FCC orientation and aggregate formation.  The LSPR band obtained in the UV-Vis spectra of 150 and 210 samples probe optical properties modification in reduced time as ultrasound power increases. Fig. 2b shows a narrow LSPR band ( Œª LSPR   =   535 nm) formation in UV-Vis spectrum of 150 sample, it takes 60 minutes of irradiation. Whereas, the 210 sample (Fig. 2c,  Œª   LSRP =   525 nm) occurs after 20 minutes (Figure 2f). The FWHM reduction from 82 to 75 nm (Fig. 2e) and the increase in HOMO-LUMO energy values from 2.32 to 2.36 eV (see Table 1) suggested quantum confinement effects related to reduced size and monodispersion of as obtained GNPs. Is possible to manufacture GNPs with high absorption interaction using ultrasonic irradiation as an only energy source, reducing laboratory requirements and controlling properties modifying simple parameters.  According with literature [48], narrow SRP bands (reduced FWHM values) correspond to interactions of monodisperse particles with UV-Vis radiation and the bathochromic shifting was related to complex polyhedral arrangement of Au   0   atoms in GNPs FCC structure predicted in theoretical simulations. The proposed ultrasound assisted Turkevich-Frens method allows to observe these spectral changes. During the experimental procedure, UV-Vis interactions reveals monodisperse and high LSPR GNPs in a few minutes (Fig. 2e). The results can be associated to an optical enhancement thanks to their accurate response in a

In this case, large aggregates and isolated nanoparticles were visible, matching with UV ‚àí Vis spectra predictions. The GNPs crystalline structure was defined by HRTEM as faceted tetrakis hexahedron polyhedral arrangement (Fig. 3b), while the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c) confirms the complex array. The 150 sample (Fig. 3d) reveals triakis icosahedron crystallization and reduced polydispersion (16 ¬± 1.6 nm).

# Page 10

10  However, particle size have not perceptible changes (Fig. 3e). In the 210 sample, the size was reduced to 12 ¬± 1 nm (Fig. 3g). A quasi-spherical morphology was observed as faceted pentakis dodecahedron (Fig. 3h) confirmed by the rings in the simulated electron diffraction patterns image (Fig. 3i).  Fig. 3.   In the first column, the (a), (d), and (g) TEM micrographs of nanoparticles, in the insets, histograms of size distribution are the showed. In the second column (b), (e) and (h) are HRTEM micrographs, insets are polyhedral. The third column (c), (f), and (i) allows us to observe the SAEDs.  Smaller sizes and more spherical clusters were produced by increasing irradiation power, according with the structural characterization. The final size depends on the relationship between the metallic precursors concentrations and the number seeds formed under the synthesis conditions, as previous works have been reported. If

# Page 11

11  there are high concentration seeds in the system, the final particle size will be small [11]. Under the proposed experimental conditions in this work, smaller nanoparticles were obtained increasing nominal irradiation power to a maximum value of 210 W at constant precursor concentration for the three samples. The size reduction suggest that the concentration of seeds is higher compared with other two samples (60 and 150) and ultrasound power increase improves the seed rate in solution. Temperature arise rate produced by primary sonochemical effects (Fig. 4a) increase the particle size and dispersion as described by Wuithschick et al. [49], and Takiyama [50]. They have observed GNPs size and polydispersion increase as temperature during the synthesis using borohydride and citrate as reductors.  However, the three samples reported in this work, have different heat rates and after 20 minutes of temperature arise, it reaches a constant temperature value. Therefore, the influence of primary and secondary sonochemical effects in GNPs synthesis can be a combination of processes [51]. Increasing the thermal energy (E   kT   ) on the reaction system, a change in equilibrium towards a more hydroxylated form (HAuCl 4   solution) can be promoted. Decreasing the redox potential of [AuCl 4 ] ‚àí  as pH increases the size of the GNPs obtained is dominated by the number of nuclei formed [11]. At this point we can associate the heat rate reached using ultrasonic irradiation with the velocity of nucleation and seed formation in GNPs synthesis and the stable region of Fig.4a with the growth time. It is supported by the reduced time of LSPR in 210 sample (Fig.2c). After 20 minutes any changes in SPR wavelength were detected, it suggest the seeds are exhausted in the colloid and monodisperse GNPS can be achieved. The 60 sample shows a broad SPR band manifesting strong contributions of polydisperse GNPs. The reduced velocity of nucleation reached using 60 W limits the seed formation and bigger GNPs were obtained.

However, the latent heat in the reaction medium causes a small but notable reduction in the size of GNPs obtained in the citrate reduction of HAuCl 4   in water. Cavitation promotes local violent reaction conditions, heating and turbulent agitation by heat transfer of gas bubbles [52], driving to accelerate nucleation process and concentration of seeds could be elevated. These phenomena lead to the relaxation and interface defects formation, in order to form polyhedral GNPs. Likewise, the energy is absorbed by the system during the cavitation processing into the solution. Then this can lead to the exotic polyhedral morphologies formation, as have been predicted in the literature. High energy potentials and formation systems can improve the plasmonic responses [53] (Fig. 4b).

The stabilization of the reaction temperature was observed after approximately 20 minutes from the start of the irradiation. Right panel: illustration of the changes in polyhedron shapes adopted by GNPs and the corresponding average particle sizes   vs.   nominal irradiation power.  Energy transmitted to the solution can be expressed as ultrasound power (W), ultrasound intensity (W/cm   2 ), acoustic energy density (W/mL), or cavitation intensity. The ultrasound and the cavitation activity in a reactor may vary for the same ultrasound intensity, if the sample volume and location of ultrasound transducer changes. Ultrasonic power, intensity, and acoustic energy density can be calculated using the following equations [37]:  ùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉ   ( ùëäùëä ) =   ùëöùëöùê∂ùê∂ ùëùùëù   ÔøΩ   ùëëùëëùëëùëë ùëëùëëùëëùëë   ÔøΩ ùëëùëë =0   (2)  ùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëà ùëÉùëÉ ùëàùëàùëàùëà ùëÉùëÉ ùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëà   ùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëÉùëÉùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëà ùëñùëñ   ( ùëäùëä / ùëàùëàùëöùëö 2 ) =   ùëÉùëÉ ùê¥ùê¥   (3)  ùê¥ùê¥ ùëàùëàùëÉùëÉ ùê¥ùê¥ ùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëà   ùëÉùëÉùëàùëàùëÉùëÉùëÉùëÉ ùëíùëí ùëñùëñ   ùëëùëë ùëÉùëÉùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëàùëñùëñ   ( ùëäùëä / ùëöùëöùëöùëö ) =   ùëÉùëÉ ùëâùëâ   (4)  where,   ùëöùëö   is the mass ( 0.09   ùëòùëò ùëíùëí ),   ùê∂ùê∂ ùëùùëù   is the specific heat capacity ( 4.186   ùëòùëòùëòùëò ùëòùëòùëòùëò   ùêæùêæ   ),   ùê¥ùê¥   is the area of the radiating surface (in the case of ultrasonic probe   ùê¥ùê¥   =   ùúãùúãùê∑ùê∑   2 4   where   ùê∑ùê∑   is the diameter ( 0.95   ùëàùëàùëöùëö ),   ùëâùëâ   is the volume ( 90   ùëöùëöùëöùëö ), and ( ùëëùëëùëëùëë ùëëùëëùëëùëë   ) is the initial rate of change of temperature during sonication. According with [37], this can be determined by fitting the data of Figure 4 (a) to a polynomial curve and

14  extrapolating to time   ( ùëàùëà ) = 0.   In Table 2, calculated power in function of the nominal irradiation power. The transmitted energy in the system increases, then raised disruption caused by ultrasonic intensity reduces the lifetime of transient bubbles and cavitation effects are more evident. These effects allow tuning the energy supplied to the system during the synthesis in order to control GNPs properties. The obtained values of the primary sonochemical effects in the solution are similar and lower than the irradiation conditions used in food industry applications [54].  Table 2.   Values of nominal irradiation power and experimental irradiation power, ultrasonic intensity, and acoustic energy density determined using calorimetric method.

During the reduction there will be at least four different anions present in the reaction medium: gold(III) chloride; (AuCl 4 ‚àí ); citrate; chloride; and hydroxide anions [55]. Following mechanism outlines, an important factor is competitive and preferential adsorption of AuCl 4 ‚àí   ions instead of citrate ions on the surface of formed seeds [56]. The AuCl 4 ‚àí   cannot to be adsorbed as a charged ion: either counter-ion complexation occurs or one of the Cl ‚àí   ligands is displaced when adsorption takes place, effectively adsorbing as AuCl 3   [57]. To the previous mechanism can be added that, effective absorption of ultrasonic energy can be achieved if GNPs are in resonance with the ultrasound. Furthermore surface potential of the pure gold surface [58], becomes more negative with increasing pH [55]. Then, is possible improve the control of the homogeneity, size and shape of

15  the synthesized nanoparticles through the combination of ultrasound and citrate in aqueous medium without the need to use mechanical stirring and external heating [38]. The presented results in this work probe that it can be achieved modifying only ultrasonic power input  In Scheme 1, reaction mechanism for the reduction of chloroaurate is illustrated. Ojea-Jim√©nez and Campanera [59] have stated that during the initial stage, the chloride ion must be displaced from chloroaurate by an oxygen atom in the citrate basic form. The intermediate I undergo an internal reorganization of the hydrogen  bridge, which coordinates with gold (I‚ÜíII). In the later stage, two -electron are transferred and decarboxylation occurs, chloride displacement yields 3-oxoglutaric acid (3-OGA) by citrate and aurous chloride complex.  Scheme 1.   Mechanistic proposal presenting combined chemical and ultrasonic reduction of chloroaurate. A) Ligand replacement: negatively charged oxygen atom from carboxylate group in citric acid, substitutes a chloride ligand of tetrachloroaurate complex anion (with formal loss of a molecule of chlorhydric acid equivalent). B) Au (III) coordination-sphere r eorganisation (adduct I ‚Üí II): it is a two -step representation of necessary assembly of electron arrangement in order to allow the reductive elimination step. C) Reductive elimination: the two electrons constituting O-Au (III) bond will be transferred to core shell of  gold atom, passing from +3‚Üí+1 formal oxidation state in adduct II. D) Oxidative

# Page 16

16  elimination: the carbon dioxide loss from adduct II generate 3-oxoglutaric acid as by- product from citric acid.   Homolysis: homolytic cleavage of solvent generates local accumulation of high-energy species such as hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals capable of react in the periphery of implossing cavitatory bubbles.  The final reduction stage poses at least three possibilities: According to Ojea- Jim√©nez and coworkers [60], 3-OGA induces the fast [3-OGA-Au+] complex formation that promotes the stability of precursor by disproportionation of aurous species. It is well-known the ultrasonic energy promotes chemical reactions by pyrolysis (thermal dissociation) water molecules and forms ‚Ä¢OH and ‚Ä¢H highly reactive free radicals [61].  Another arrangement adequate to disproportion reaction, with no need for 3-OGA intervention, is based on the intensity of aurophilic interactions between gold atoms and/or gold (I) ions with energies comparable to strong hydrogen bonds [59]. We consider the formation of small clusters of mixed metal-ion gold, as has been demonstrated for silver species [63], as understood, 3-OGA is capable of decomposing in the presence of transition metals [64] through a SET mechanism involving the reduction of gold (I) to a gold atom, with the formation of a radical intermediate, once again.  During the disproportionation process, a complex tetrachloroaurate is recycled for the two-electron reduction by citrate. The equilibrium is driven by the departure of gold from the system to form clusters, which eventually yields seeds for NPs growth [65, 66]. These perform the catalyst role for deposition of newly formed gold atoms because of reaction proceeds faster in the presence of gold surfaces, as a seed-mediated growth mechanism [11]. In this case, no further seed formation was observed in the SPR and the initial settled kinetic control became thermodynamic.  A second reduction mechanism is proposed based on the range of hydrogen produced in the reaction medium. At working pH values of 3.3 (initially) and up to 5.2 after the reaction, the formation of reductants hydrated electrons [67] in this solution is not feasible. Thus, we conclude that hydrogen is the main reducer in a mechanism single electron transfer SET. The reduction potential was   ‚àí 2.3 V. It

The degenerate reaction of the hydrogen atom with the hydroxyl radical reforms the solvent. Even when H 2 O   2   is formed, this has been used to promote nanoparticle growth after seed addition to a chloroaurate solution [69]. The hydrogen ranges produced with this methodology are from 20 to 18 ŒºM, other reported ranges are between 10 and 6 ŒºM per hour (on sonochemical oxidation of iodine by a hydroxyl radical at 20 kHz and 42   ¬± 2 W) at room temperature and 50 ¬∞C respectively [70].  The third reaction mechanism is based on the radical species formed in the reaction. The presence of air dissolved in the reaction mixture triggers a radical chain mechanism that involves oxidative degradation of citric acid [71]. Notably, the oxidative pathway of citrate, 3-oxoglutarate and further, encompasses many propagation steps, including possible formation of an alkyl radical, centered on the transfer of a carbon atom   Œ±   to the carboxyl group. NMR has detected oxidative byproducts during the formation of gold nanoparticles by citrate reduction [72]. The oxidation implies the formation of a carbocation highly unstable, by the electron- withdrawing group (EWG) ‚ÄìCO   2 H. The third reaction mechanism is based on the radical species formed in the reaction EWG [73].  4. Conclusions  The proposed experimental methodology using ultrasound to GNPs manufacture allowed to obtain controlled shape, homogenous narrow size distribution, and enhanced plasmonic properties by tuning the irradiation power. The proposed experimental procedure allows to show the different phenomena involved in the ultrasound assisted Turkevich-Frens method, associating the physical effects such as temperature and pH rise over reaction with cavitation phenomena and radical exchange. The obtained results show the strong influence of increasing ultrasound irradiation on particle size, polyhedral structure and optical properties of as obtained GNPs and the reaction kinetics for their formation. Particle sizes from 16

18  nm reached in 60 and 150 samples can be reduced to 12 nm using 210 sample procedure. The nucleation, growth, and saturation as irradiation power increase displayed exotic solid configuration of GNPs: tetrakis hexahedron, triakis icosahedron, and pentakis dodecahedron as HRTEM images reveal. The GNPs formation kinetics monitored by SRP in the UV-Vis spectra reveals the enhanced optical properties and LSRP at reduced time (20 min). The seed concentration is optimized by ultrasound irradiation and lead to monodisperse and localized absorption GNPs manufacture. The disproportionation process of three complexes AuCl 2 ‚àí   form clusters via aurophilic interaction were suggested in order to explain chemical effects in the synthesis. A simple molecular-based scheme was proposed, from the formation and growth processing of GNPs under the reported reaction conditions. Electrons of AuCl 2 ‚àí   are rapidly exchanged through the gold surface and after AuCl 4 ‚àí   and Cl ‚àí   are desorbed and a complex tetrachloroaurate is recycled for the two-electron reduction by citrate. This mechanism allows the deposition of new gold atoms on the surface and promotes the growth of seeds. The experiments were designed to explore experimental ultrasound irradiation power influence on the optimization of GNPs systems and the results show remarkable improvement of the obtained materials, positioning to the ultrasound assisted methods as an option for nanomaterials elaboration, modification and optimization in a simple and economic way.
