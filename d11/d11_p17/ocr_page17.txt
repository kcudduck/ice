readily reduces inorganic ions, like Au(l) yielding Au(0) and hydronium ion as
products, like the reduction of the silver ion, as presented by Sarkar [68]. The
degenerate reaction of the hydrogen atom with the hydroxyl radical reforms the
solvent. Even when H20: Is formed, this has been used to promote nanoparticle
growth after seed addition to a chloroaurate solution [69]. The hydrogen ranges
produced with this methodology are from 20 to 18 uM, other reported ranges are
between 10 and 6 uM per hour (on sonochemical oxidation of iodine by a hydroxyl
radical at 20 kHz and 42 £2 W) at room temperature and 50 °C respectively [70].
The third reaction mechanism is based on the radical species formed in the
reaction. The presence of air dissolved in the reaction mixture triggers a radical
chain mechanism that involves oxidative degradation of citric acid [71]. Notably, the
oxidative pathway of citrate, 3-oxoglutarate and further, encompasses many
propagation steps, including possible formation of an alkyl radical, centered on the
transfer of a carbon atom a to the carboxyl group. NMR has detected oxidative
byproducts during the formation of gold nanoparticles by citrate reduction [72]. The
oxidation implies the formation of a carbocation highly unstable, by the electron-
withdrawing group (EWG) —CO2H. The third reaction mechanism is based on the
radical species formed in the reaction EWG [73].
4. Conclusions
The proposed experimental methodology using ultrasound to GNPs manufacture
allowed to obtain controlled shape, homogenous narrow size distribution, and
enhanced plasmonic properties by tuning the irradiation power. The proposed
experimental procedure allows to show the different phenomena involved in the
ultrasound assisted Turkevich-Frens method, associating the physical effects such
as temperature and pH rise over reaction with cavitation phenomena and radical
exchange. The obtained results show the strong influence of increasing ultrasound
Irradiation on particle size, polyhedral structure and optical properties of as
obtained GNPs and the reaction kinetics for their formation. Particle sizes from 16
