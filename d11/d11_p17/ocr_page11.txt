there are high concentration seeds in the system, the final particle size will be
small [11]. Under the proposed experimental conditions in this work, smaller
nanoparticles were obtained increasing nominal irradiation power to a maximum
value of 210 W at constant precursor concentration for the three samples. The size
reduction suggest that the concentration of seeds Is higher compared with other
two samples (60 and 150) and ultrasound power increase improves the seed rate
In solution. Temperature arise rate produced by primary sonochemical effects (Fig.
4a) Increase the particle size and dispersion as described by Wuithschick et al.
[49], and Takiyama [50]. They have observed GNPs size and polydispersion
Increase as temperature during the synthesis using borohydride and citrate as
reductors.
However, the three samples reported In this work, have different heat rates and
after 20 minutes of temperature arise, it reaches a constant temperature value.
Therefore, the influence of primary and secondary sonochemical effects in GNPs
synthesis can be a combination of processes [51]. Increasing the thermal energy
(Ext) on the reaction system, a change in equilibrium towards a more hydroxylated
form (HAuUCIl4 solution) can be promoted. Decreasing the redox potential of [AuCla]-
as pH increases the size of the GNPs obtained is dominated by the number of
nuclei formed [11]. At this point we can associate the heat rate reached using
ultrasonic irradiation with the velocity of nucleation and seed formation in GNPs
synthesis and the stable region of Fig.4a with the growth time. It Is supported by
the reduced time of LSPR In 210 sample (Fig.2c). After 20 minutes any changes In
SPR wavelength were detected, it suggest the seeds are exhausted in the colloid
and monodisperse GNPS can be achieved. The 60 sample shows a broad SPR
band manifesting strong contributions of polydisperse GNPs. The reduced velocity
of nucleation reached using 60 W limits the seed formation and bigger GNPs were
obtained.
