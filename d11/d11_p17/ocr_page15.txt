the synthesized nanoparticles through the combination of ultrasound and citrate In
aqueous medium without the need to use mechanical stirring and external heating
[38]. The presented results in this work probe that it can be achieved modifying
only ultrasonic power input
In Scheme 1, reaction mechanism for the reduction of chloroaurate is illustrated.
Ojea-Jiménez and Campanera [59] have stated that during the Initial stage, the
chloride ion must be displaced from chloroaurate by an oxygen atom in the citrate
basic form. The intermediate | undergo an internal reorganization of the hydrogen
bridge, which coordinates with gold (I—1l). In the later stage, two-electron are
transferred and decarboxylation occurs, chloride displacement yields 3-oxoglutaric
acid (3-OGA) by citrate and aurous chloride complex.

Scheme 1. Mechanistic proposal presenting combined chemical and ultrasonic reduction
of chloroaurate. A) Ligand replacement: negatively charged oxygen atom from carboxylate
group In citric acid, substitutes a chloride ligand of tetrachloroaurate complex anion (with
formal loss of a molecule of chlorhydric acid equivalent). B) Au (lll) coordination-sphere
reorganisation (adduct | — Il): it is a two-step representation of necessary assembly of
electron arrangement in order to allow the reductive elimination step. C) Reductive
elimination: the two electrons constituting O-Au (lll) bond will be transferred to core shell of
gold atom, passing from +3—+1 formal oxidation state in adduct Il. D) Oxidative
