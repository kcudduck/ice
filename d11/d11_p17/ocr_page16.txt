elimination: the carbon dioxide loss from adduct Il generate 3-oxoglutaric acid as by-
product from citric acid. Homolysis: homolytic cleavage of solvent generates local
accumulation of high-energy species such as hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals capable of
react in the periphery of implossing cavitatory bubbles.
The final reduction stage poses at least three possibilities: According to Ojea-
Jiménez and coworkers [60], 3-OGA induces the fast [3-OGA-Au+] complex
formation that promotes the stability of precursor by disproportionation of aurous
species. It is well-known the ultrasonic energy promotes chemical reactions by
pyrolysis (thermal dissociation) water molecules and forms «OH and <H highly
reactive free radicals [61].
Another arrangement adequate to disproportion reaction, with no need for 3-OGA
Intervention, is based on the intensity of aurophilic interactions between gold atoms
and/or gold (I) ions with energies comparable to strong hydrogen bonds [59]. We
consider the formation of small clusters of mixed metal-ion gold, as has been
demonstrated for silver species [63], as understood, 3-OGA Is capable of
decomposing In the presence of transition metals [64] through a SET mechanism
Involving the reduction of gold (I) to a gold atom, with the formation of a radical
Intermediate, once again.
During the disproportionation process, a complex tetrachloroaurate is recycled for
the two-electron reduction by citrate. The equilibrium is driven by the departure of
gold from the system to form clusters, which eventually yields seeds for NPs
growth [65, 66]. These perform the catalyst role for deposition of newly formed gold
atoms because of reaction proceeds faster in the presence of gold surfaces, as a
seed-mediated growth mechanism [11]. In this case, no further seed formation was
observed In the SPR and the initial settled kinetic control became thermodynamic.
A second reduction mechanism is proposed based on the range of hydrogen
produced in the reaction medium. At working pH values of 3.3 (initially) and up to
5.2 after the reaction, the formation of reductants hydrated electrons [67] In this
solution Is not feasible. Thus, we conclude that hydrogen is the main reducer in a
mechanism single electron transfer SET. The reduction potential was —2.3 V. It
