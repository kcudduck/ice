Fig. 4. Left panel: Temperature increase as a function of time along the reaction process
for samples labeled 60, 150 and 210. The stabilization of the reaction temperature was
observed after approximately 20 minutes from the start of the irradiation. Right panel.
illustration of the changes in polyhedron shapes adopted by GNPs and the corresponding
average particle sizes vs. nominal irradiation power.
Energy transmitted to the solution can be expressed as ultrasound power (W),
ultrasound intensity (W/cm?), acoustic energy density (W/mL), or cavitation
Intensity. The ultrasound and the cavitation activity in a reactor may vary for the
same ultrasound intensity, If the sample volume and location of ultrasound
transducer changes. Ultrasonic power, intensity, and acoustic energy density can
be calculated using the following equations [37]:
aT
Power (W) = mC, Fe (2)
Ultrasonic intensity (W/cm?) = . (3)
Acoustic energy density (W /mL) = : (4)

the diameter (0.95 cm), V Is the volume (90 mL), and E) IS the Initial rate of
change of temperature during sonication. According with [37], this can be
determined by fitting the data of Figure 4 (a) to a polynomial curve and
