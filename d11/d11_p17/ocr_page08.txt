the UV-Vis bathochromic shifting observed in the spectra, as a function of time
reaction for all synthesized samples. The GNPs sample at 60 W had a limited
Intensity from absorption due to nucleation and growth, this effect is associated
with large Au clusters formation, but does not contribute to the absorption band
signal. The spectra revealed a broadband localized at 650 nm after 60 minutes of
irradiation (Fig. 2d). The hypochromic shift at Aqgp= 520 nm was associated with
small GNPs signal and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). The lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value of 2.21 eV probes the formation of
large aggregates. The broad full width at half maximum (FWHM) (114 nm) of the
SRP band was associated with the multiple twinned GNPs in FCC orientation and
aggregate formation.
The LSPR band obtained in the UV-Vis spectra of 150 and 210 samples probe
optical properties modification in reduced time as ultrasound power increases. Fig.
2b shows a narrow LSPR band (ALspr = 535 nm) formation in UV-Vis spectrum of
150 sample, It takes 60 minutes of irradiation. Whereas, the 210 sample (Fig. 2c,
ALsrp= 525 nm) occurs after 20 minutes (Figure 2f). The FWHM reduction from 82
to 75 nm (Fig. 2e) and the increase in HOMO-LUMO energy values from 2.32 to
2.36 eV (see Table 1) suggested quantum confinement effects related to reduced
size and monodispersion of as obtained GNPs. Is possible to manufacture GNPs
with high absorption interaction using ultrasonic irradiation as an only energy
source, reducing laboratory requirements and controlling properties modifying
simple parameters.
According with literature [48], narrow SRP bands (reduced FWHM values)
correspond to interactions of monodisperse particles with UV-Vis radiation and the
bathochromic shifting was related to complex polyhedral arrangement of AuÂ® atoms
IN GNPs FCC structure predicted in theoretical simulations. The proposed
ultrasound assisted Turkevich-Frens method allows to observe these spectral
changes. During the experimental procedure, UV-Vis interactions reveals
monodisperse and high LSPR GNPs in a few minutes (Fig. 2e). The results can be
associated to an optical enhancement thanks to their accurate response In a
