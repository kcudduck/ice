1. Introduction
The gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been studied as plasmonic materials for their
application in biomedical field. Some of these applications involves photo-thermal
cancer treatment agents [1], molecular labeling [2], radiotherapies [3], drug delivery
systems [4], and optical sensing devices [5]. The current demand for well-defined
GNPs properties is creating the cutting edge methods toward more efficient, safe
and economically for nanoparticle manufacture [6]. Colloidal GNPs have been
easily synthesized and size and shape controlled by chemical methods [7].
Turkevich et al. developed a synthetic route to obtain colloidal gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) based on hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuUCls) reduction from citric acid
and sodium citrate as reducing agents in boiling water, under vigorous stirring
conditions [8]. The advantages of sodium citrate salt in the synthesis are: it acts as
a reducing and stabilizing agent, also forms a buffer in aqueous solution avoiding
abrupt pH modifications in the reaction. Tuerkevich-Frens method allows preparing
GNPs with different sizes by modifying gold ions/citrate ratios for controlled
nucleation velocity and steric surface can be achieved for colloidal stability and
biological functionalization [9-11].
A challenge in the chemical synthetic routes for GNPs manufacture is to control the
primary morphology, particle size distribution, crystalline structure in a simple way,
and retain their properties along time [12]. Several strategies have done to control
these properties using surfactants [13], dispersing agents [14], and biological
compounds [15]. Likewise, other approaches include electromagnetic irradiation,
such as microwaves [16], ultraviolet (UV) light [17], electron beam [18], and
gamma-ray [19] to obtain GNPs without using reducing agents, and their
sterilization by means of a one-step process were also developed [20]. The
Interaction between irradiation energy and the irradiated solution has been the key
to control the properties of GNPs by kinetics reaction manipulation. However, high
energy Is needed for ionizing those systems, additionally, complicated
experimental setups are required, and making manufacture non-rentable for
industrial production.
