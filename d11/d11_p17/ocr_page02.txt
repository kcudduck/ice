shape and size distribution, which were associated with physical (cavitation,
temperature) and chemical (radical generation, pH) conditions In the aqueous
solution. The results showed guasi—spherical GNPs as pentakis dodecahedron
(ALspr=560 nm), triakis icosahedron (ALspr=535 nm), and tetrakis hexahedron
(ALspr= 525 nm) in a size range from 12-16 nm. Chemical effects of ultrasound
irradiation were suggested in the disproportionation process, electrons of AuClz>-
are rapidly exchanged through the gold surface. After AuCls~ and Clare desorbed
and a complex tetrachloroaurate Is recycled for the two-electron reduction by
citrate, aurophilic interaction between complexes AuClz~, electrons exchange and
gold seeds, the deposition of new gold atoms on the surface promoting the growth
of GNPs. These mechanisms are enhanced by the extraordinary effects of
ultrasound such as the cavitation effects and transmitted energy into the solution.
These results show the that the plasmonic response from our nanoparticles can be
tuned using a simple methodology with minimum infrastructure requirements.
Moreover, the production method could be easily scalable to meet industrial
manufacture needs.
