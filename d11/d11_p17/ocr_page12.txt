The sonochemical method implemented in this work, did not reach boiling
temperature unlike the classic hotplate system. However, the latent heat in the
reaction medium causes a small but notable reduction in the size of GNPs
obtained In the citrate reduction of HAuUCls In water. Cavitation promotes local
violent reaction conditions, heating and turbulent agitation by heat transfer of gas
bubbles [52], driving to accelerate nucleation process and concentration of seeds
could be elevated. These phenomena lead to the relaxation and interface defects
formation, in order to form polyhedral GNPs. Likewise, the energy Is absorbed by
the system during the cavitation processing into the solution. Then this can lead to
the exotic polyhedral morphologies formation, as have been predicted in the
literature. High energy potentials and formation systems can improve the
plasmonic responses [53] (Fig. 4b).
