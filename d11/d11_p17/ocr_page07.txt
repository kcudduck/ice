ultrasonic processing for GNPs, and the sonochemical effects in aqueous solution
are showed in Fig. 1.

2.3 Characterization
The UV-Vis spectra (350 to 1000 nm) were collected from 3 mL aliquots every 10
minutes and measured in a quartz cuvette for monitoring the SRP bathochromic
shift during GNPs nucleation and growth. Samples were supported on Lacey
copper grids by dropping a diluted sample in water and drying in a vacuum for 24
hours for TEM observation. During the colloid synthesis temperature readings
every 10 minutes were made for all experiments. The pH was measured after and
before of ultrasonic irradiation.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Optical characterization
After performing the ultrasound radiation, the colloidal solutions showed different
colors, violet for 60 W and ruby-red for 150 and 210 W samples. Figs. 2a—c shows
