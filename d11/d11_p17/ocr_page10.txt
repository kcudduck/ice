However, particle size have not perceptible changes (Fig. 3e). In the 210 sample,
the size was reduced to 12+1 nm (Fig. 3g). A guasi-spherical morphology was
observed as faceted pentakis dodecahedron (Fig. 3h) confirmed by the rings in the
simulated electron diffraction patterns image (Fig. 3i).

Fig. 3. In the first column, the (a), (d), and (g) TEM micrographs of nanoparticles, in the
Insets, histograms of size distribution are the showed. In the second column (b), (e) and
(h) are HRTEM micrographs, insets are polyhedral. The third column (c), (f), and (i) allows
us to observe the SAEDs.
Smaller sizes and more spherical clusters were produced by increasing irradiation
power, according with the structural characterization. The final size depends on the
relationship between the metallic precursors concentrations and the number seeds
formed under the synthesis conditions, as previous works have been reported. If
