nm reached in 60 and 150 samples can be reduced to 12 nm using 210 sample
procedure. The nucleation, growth, and saturation as irradiation power increase
displayed exotic solid configuration of GNPs: tetrakis hexahedron, triakis
icosahedron, and pentakis dodecahedron as HRTEM images reveal. The GNPs
formation kinetics monitored by SRP In the UV-Vis spectra reveals the enhanced
optical properties and LSRP at reduced time (20 min). The seed concentration Is
optimized by ultrasound irradiation and lead to monodisperse and localized
absorption GNPs manufacture. The disproportionation process of three complexes
AuCl2~ form clusters via aurophilic interaction were suggested In order to explain
chemical effects in the synthesis. A simple molecular-based scheme was
proposed, from the formation and growth processing of GNPs under the reported
reaction conditions. Electrons of AuClz~ are rapidly exchanged through the gold
surface and after AuCls~ and Cl are desorbed and a complex tetrachloroaurate Is
recycled for the two-electron reduction by citrate. This mechanism allows the
deposition of new gold atoms on the surface and promotes the growth of seeds.
The experiments were designed to explore experimental ultrasound irradiation
power influence on the optimization of GNPs systems and the results show
remarkable improvement of the obtained materials, positioning to the ultrasound
assisted methods as an option for nanomaterials elaboration, modification and
optimization in a simple and economic way.
