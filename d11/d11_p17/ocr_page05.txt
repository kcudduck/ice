factor of chemical intermediates generation at pressure—temperature relationships
during the oxidation—reduction reaction [40]. Then, investigate their effect in GNPs
IS Important to enhance their optical properties for Biomedical applications based
on intrinsic features such as SPR, physicochemical and surface interactions to
recognize biomolecules in sensing systems or photo thermal and photodynamic
therapies [41]. The GNPs properties are sensitive to size and shape modifications
and their adequate control during the synthesis Is crucial for their implementation
as tool in early disease detection [42] and multifunctional nanomedicines for cancer
therapy [43].
Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the surface energy
of GNPs decreases by increasing cluster size at 0 K, but It is increased at higher
temperatures [44]. The self-assembly of molecular polyhedra into complex
structures can modify the shape of Au® atoms polyhedral in a face-centered cubic
(FCC). The FCC clusters have shown different optical behavior depending on the
facet structure, the crystal system arrangement is crucial in the modification of
ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) interactions. Au dodecahedron and icosahedron
exhibit bathochromic shifted and broader surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
peaks, whereas the quasi—spherical shape of the truncated octahedron leads to a
similar optical response as a perfect sphere, with a slight bathochromic shifting and
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [45]. Electron diffraction patterns
observed In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization have
confirmed the facet orientations and the FCC structure to form exotic solids [46].
An experimental survey on the Au clusters synthesis reported their evolution In
different solids, controlling the cluster arrangement is possible to influence the
optical response [47].
In this work, the variation of ultrasonic power from 60 to 210 W nominal values in
the synthesis of GNPs using an ultrasonic probe at 20 kHz of frequency was
studied. The experimental methodology was designed to observe the primary and
secondary sonochemical effects monitoring temperature every 10 minutes and final
pH differential after 60 minutes of irradiation to determine the macroscopic effects
