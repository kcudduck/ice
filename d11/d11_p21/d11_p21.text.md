Volcanic tremor: Nonlinear excitation by fluid flow
Bruce    R. Julian
U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California


Abstract. A nonlinear processanalogousto the excitation mechanismof musicalwind instru-
mentsand human vocal cordscan explain many characteristicsof volcanictremor, including(1)
periodic and "chaotic"oscillations,with peaked and irregular spectra respectively,(2) rapid pul-
sationsin eruptions occurringat the same frequencyas tremor, (3) systematicchangesin tremor
amplitude as channelgeometryevolvesduring an eruption, (4) the period doublingreported for
Hawaiian deep tremor, and (5) the fact that the onsetof tremor can be either gradual or abrupt.
Volcanic "long-period" earthquakes can be explained as oscillations excited by transient distur-
bances produced by nearby earthquakes, fluid heterogeneity, or changesin channel geometry,
when the magma flow rate is too low to excite continuous tremor. A simple lumped-parameter
tremor model involving the flow of an incompressibleviscousfluid through a channel with mov-
able elastic walls leads to a third-order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For
different driving fluid pressures,numerical solutions exhibit steady flow, simple limit-cycle os-
cillations, a cascade of period-doubling subharmonic bifurcations, and chaotic oscillations con-
trolled by a strange attractor of R/Ssslertype. In this model, tremor occurs most easily at lo-
cal constrictions, and fluid dischargeis lower than would occur in unstable steady flow.

the superposition principle does not apply. We are thus
forced to rely heavily on numerical integration, qualitative
phase space analysis, and approximate methods such as
linearized approximations valid only in limited regions of
phase space.Nevertheless,there are many common features
in the qualitative behavior of most nonlinear systems
[Feigenbaum,1980]. In particular, dissipative honlinear
oscillatorsthat obey ordinary differential equations of third
or higher order can exhibit "chaotic" aperiodic oscillations
that are in many respects indistinguishable from a random
process. Most such systems undergo a transition from
regular to chaotic behavior in similar ways, through a
sequenceof subharmonic bifurcations, often referred to as
the "period-doublingroute to chaos"[Eckmann, 1981]. In
this process, a static equilibrium state becomes unstable as
nonlinear effects become stronger in response to changes in
someparameter (for example,the Reynoldsnumber in fluid
flow or the Rayleighnumber in convection),and limit-cycle
oscillationsbegin. Initially, these oscillations are simple, but
with increasing nonlinearity a sequence of subharmonics
appears, leading to longer-period and more complicated
oscillations, and then to chaotic oscillations.
   Aki and Koyanagi [1981, p. 7096], in a study of deep
tremor in Hawaii, observed systematic variations in tremor
frequency that correspond closely to a period-doubling
sequence:

   One of our most interesting findings is that the
   period of tremor almost always changes with time
   during a course of a tremor episode. A typical major
   episodestarts with high-frequency(5- 10 Hz) with
   moderate amplitude, grows into violent motion with
   low frequency (1.5- 3 Hz) dominating, and becomes
   gradually weaker but with sporadic returns of high-
   frequency vibrations near the end of the episode....
   From a visual inspection, it appears that the period
   doubles approximately in a step-like manner, rather
   than gradually increasing.

Aki and Koyanagi [1981] attributed these observationsto
discontinuouschangesin the effective lengths of resonating
fluid-filled cracks, caused by the opening and closing
of interconnecting channels. Period doubling offers an
alternative explanation.
   Even though tremor generation must be a nonlinear
process,and even though phenomenadiagnostic of nonlinear
oscillation have been observed in tremor, it is not obvious
exactly what processis operating; severalphysically distinct
nonlinear mechanisms might be at work. The recently
recognized universal characteristics of nonlinear systems,
though helpful for recognizingnonlinearity, are of less help
