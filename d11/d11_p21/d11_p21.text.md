Long-period volcano seismicity: its source
and use in eruption forecasting
Bernard A. Chouet
At an active volcano, long-period seismicity (with typical periods in the range 0.2-2 s) reflects
pressure fluctuations resulting from unsteady mass transport in the sub-surface plumbing
system, and hence provides a glimpse of the internal dynamics of the volcanic edifice. When
this activity occurs at shallow depths, it may signal the pressure-induced disruption of the
steam-dominated region of the volcano, and can accordingly be a useful indicator of impending
eruption.

THE science of volcano seismology aims to understand the tion regarding the state of the fluid. Seismic events originating in

properties of such systems, and map the extent and evolution of tremor. Long-period events resemble small tectonic earthquakes

A complex of two TFIID TATA box-binding protein-associated factors (TAF;s) is described at 2.0 A
resolution. The amino-terminal portions of dTAF,42 and dTAF,62 from Drosophila adopt the
canonical histone fold, consisting of two short a-helices flanking a long central a-helix. Like
histones H3 and H4, dTAF,42 and dTAF,62 form an intimate heterodimer by extensive
hydrophobic contacts between the paired molecules. In solution and in the crystalline state,
the dTAF,42/dTAF,62 complex exists as a heterotetramer, resembling the (H3/H4), hetero-
tetrameric core of the histone octamer, suggesting that TFIID contains a histone octamer-like
substructure.
