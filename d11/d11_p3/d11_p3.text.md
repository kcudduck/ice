Nonlinear behavior of bubbles, and most importantly   1  2   order subharmonics (SH), are used to increase the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR) in diagnostic ultrasound (US) and to monitor bubble mediated therapeutic US. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when bubbles are sonicated with their SH resonance frequency ( f sh   = 2 f r   where   f r   is the linear resonance frequency), SHs are generated at the lowest excitation pressure. SHs then increase rapidly with pressure increase and reach an upper limit of the achievable SH signal strength. Numerous studies have investigated the pressure threshold of SH oscillations; however, conditions to enhance the saturation level of SHs has not been investigated. In this paper nonlinear dynamics of bubbles excited by frequencies in the range of   f r   < f <   2 f r   is studied for different sizes of bubbles (400nm-8   μm ).   We show that the SH resonance frequency is pressure dependent and decreases as pressure increases. When a bubble is sonicated with its pressure dependent SH resonance frequency, oscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation from a P1 or P2 regime to a P2 oscillation regime with higher amplitude. The saddle node bifurcation is concomitant with over saturation of the SH and UH amplitude and eventual enhancement of the upper limit of SH and UH strength (e.g.   ≈   7 dB in UH amplitude). This can increase the CTR and signal to noise ratio in applications. Here, we show that the highest non-destructive SH amplitude occurs when   f   ≅   1 . 5   −   1 . 8 f r  I.   INTRODUCTION  A bubble is a nonlinear oscillator that can exhibits complex and chaotic dynamics [1-8].   Bubbles are the building block of several applications and phenomena; they have applications in sonochemistry [9-15], ultrasonic cleaning [16,17] , sonoluminscence [14,15] and medical ul- trasound [18-23].   Pioneering works of [1-8] have shown the nonlinear and chaotic properties of forced bubble os- cillations which are followed by recent extensive studies on the nonlinear behavior of bubbles in water [23-27], coated bubbles [24,26] , bubbles in highly viscous media [28-33]; and bubbles sonicated with asymmetrical driv- ing acoustic forces [34-37]. Complexity of the bubble dy- namics makes it very difficult to effectively implement bubbles in applications; however, within this complexity there exists an opportunity for beneficial bubble behav- ior in applications. Period doubling (PD) is an example of a beneficial non- linear behavior.   In the bubble oscillator PD results in generation of   1  2   order SHs and   3  2   order UHs.   SH os- cillations of bubbles are highly desirable due to unique  ∗   amin.jafarisojahrood@ryerson.ca  properties that makes them very useful in several ap- plications. Ultrasound contrast agents (coated bubbles) are clinically used on a daily basis to image microvascular blood flow and quantify blood perfusion (e.g. in the liver, kidney and the myocardium) [38-40].   Due the absence of SHs and UHs in tissues response to diagnostic ultra- sound [20,41-43]; SH and UH emissions by bubbles allow the detection of blood flow with exceptional contrast en- hancement [20,41-43].   Furthermore, SH emissions have lower frequencies and are attenuated less by the tissue. In therapeutic ultrasound SH emissions are used for mon- itoring therapeutic applications of ultrasound and as an indicator for stable cavitation [44-45]. SHs and UHs are employed to measure the efficacy of blood brain barrier opening [46,47].   SHs are proposed for the non-invasive measurement of the pressure inside vessels [48-50], to im- age the microvasculature [41,51-52] and can be utilized in bubble sizing [53], among other applications. Esche [54] was the first to characterize the SH bubble behavior through experimental observations in 1952. Pi- oneering theoretical works of Eller [55] and Prosperetti [56-59] showed through a weakly non-linear analysis of the Rayleigh-Plesset model [60] that the subharmonic be- havior of bubbles can only exist if the driving pressure amplitude exceeds a threshold pressure; it has been pre- dicted theoretically that the pressure threshold is mini-

2 mum for sonications with twice the linear resonance fre- quency ( f r ) of the bubbles. This frequency is referred to as the linear   1  2   order SH resonance frequency ( f sh =2 f r ). Recently, several experimental [61-63], numerical [64,65] and theoretical [59,62] studies have investigated the pres- sure threshold of SH generation in bubble oscillations. These works have shown that SH oscillations in bubbles have three stages:   initiation, rapid growth and satura- tion. Numerical Investigation of the SH threshold in un- coated and coated bubbles in [64,65]; have shown that for small bubbles (less than 500nm), increased damping weakens the bubble response at   f sh . This leads to a shift of the minimum SH pressure threshold from   f sh   towards  f r . We have recently studied the bifurcation structure of the bubbles excited with their   f r   and   f sh   [66].   We have shown that for uncoated bubbles in water, non- destructive (   R  R 0   < 2 [67]) stable SH oscillations are less likely to develop if the bubble is sonicated with   f r   . This is because when   f   =   f r   , SHs oscillations only devel- oped for   R  R 0   > 2.   When the bubble is sonicated with  f sh , PD occurs through a bow-tie shape bifurcation and at very gentle oscillation regimes (   R  R 0   <   1 . 05). This sug- gest that bubbles are more likely to sustain stable SHs at   f sh   [66].   The generation of PD in bifurcation dia- grams was concomitant with the initiation of SHs which rapidly grow with increased pressure and get saturated. In other words, there is an upper limit for the achievable SHs and UHs strength and acoustic pressure increase will not necessarily result in SHs increase. To the contrary, a pressure increase can result in chaotic oscillations and/or bubble destruction which will lead to subsequent decrease in SHs and UHs strength [50,66]. Despite several studies investigating the SH threshold of the bubbles [56-59,61- 65], conditions for the enhancement of the upper limit of non-destructive SHs and UHs oscillations are under- investigated.   Furthermore, the bifurcation structure of the bubble oscillator in the regime of   1  2   order SHs when  f r   < f   < ≅   f sh   is not studied in detail.   Due to the importance of the SH and UH oscillations of bubbles, comprehensive knowledge of the resonant period 2 (P2) oscillations and conditions to enhance non-destructive P2 oscillations can aid in understanding and optimizing bub- ble applications. In this study, which follows upon our previous work [26] where pressure dependent resonance ( P Df r   ) was used to increase the non-destructive scattered pressure ( P sc ) by bubbles, we investigate the pressure dependence of SH resonance ( P df sh   ). Through numerically simulating the resonance curves of bubbles at different pressures, linear ( f sh ) and pressure dependent ( P df sh   ) SH resonance fre- quencies of bubble diameters ranging from 400nm up to 8 microns are calculated ( 8 microns can be considered the upper limit of size used in biomedical applications [19]). The bifurcation structure of the bubble oscillations as a function of pressure is studied when   f   =   P df sh .   The corresponding SH and UH strength of the   P sc   are cal- culated and studied in conjunction with the bifurcation diagrams. We show that   P df sh   decreases as pressure in- creases.   Sonication of the bubble with   P df sh   results in a saddle node bifurcation from a period 1 (P1) or a P2 oscillation regime to a P2 oscillation of higher amplitude. This is concomitant by the oversaturation of the SHs and UHs strength of up to   ≅ 4 and   ≅ 7 dB. Additionally for each bubble size there is an optimum frequency between 1 . 5 f r   −   1 . 8 f r which results in the maximum SH scattering cross section.  II.   METHODS  Similar to [66], we have chosen the uncoated bubble as the bubble oscillator of interest. Effect of coating is ne- glected as addition of the encapsulation introduces more complexity to the bubble dynamics.   In order to have a detailed understanding on the dynamics of the bubble its preferable to separate the nonlinear effects of coat- ing from that of the bubble itself.   This makes it easier to understand the dynamics of the system and under- stand the basis of the bubble behavior. Furthermore, in future studies where coating is involved, information of the system behavior in the absence of coating will allow for a more straightforward understanding of the complex effects of coating on the system behavior.  A.   The Bubble model  The radial oscillations of the bubbles are numerically simulated by solving the Keller-Miksis equation [68]:  ρ [(1 −   ˙ R  c   ) R   ¨ R +  3  2  ˙ R 2 (1 −   ˙ R  3 c   )] = (1+  ˙ R  c   )( G )+   R  c d  dt   ( G ) (1) where   G   =   P g   −   4 μ L   ˙ R  R   −   2 σ  R   −   P 0   −   P A sin (2 πf t ).   P g  is the gas pressure in the bubble and is given by   P g   = ( P 0   +   2 σ  R   )   ∗   (   R  R 0   ) 3 γ  In this equation, R is radius at time t,   R 0   is the initial bubble radius,   ˙ R   is the wall velocity of the bubble and  ¨ R  is the wall acceleration   ρ   is the liquid density (998   kg  m 3   ), c is the sound speed (1481 m/s),   P g   is the gas pressure,  σ   is the surface tension (0.0725   N  m   ),   μ   is the liquid vis- cosity (0.001 Pa.s),   P A   = and   f   are the amplitude and frequency of the applied acoustic pressure.   The values in the parentheses are for water at 293 0 K. In this paper the gas inside the bubble is Air ( γ =1.4) and water is the host media.  B.   Resonance curves  It is shown that above a pressure threshold SH oscilla- tions are generated and the threshold is minimum at   f sh  ( f   = 2 f r ).   The radial oscillations of free uncoated air bubbles ( R 0 =200nm-4   μm ) were numerically simulated

SH resonance frequency of a bubble with   R 0   = 2 μm   at different pressure amplitudes.  by solving equation 1, for   f r   < f <   2 . 2 f r   and for a range of pressure amplitudes. The resonance curves were only calculated for pressure amplitude and frequency combi- nations that result in non-destructive bubble oscillations  R  R 0   <   2 [26,67].   The maximum bubble radius was cal- culated in the last 20 cycles of a 200 cycle driving pulse to ensure that there was no transient behavior (similar analysis to [66]) and then plotted as a function of fre- quency in each graph.   At each pressure, f sh   and   P df sh  were selected from the graphs and used to generate the bifurcation diagrams in the next step.  C.   Bifurcation diagrams  Bifurcation diagrams are valuable tools to   analyze the dynamics of nonlinear systems where the qualitative and quantitative changes of the dynamics of the system can be investigated effectively over a wide range of the control parameters.   In this paper, we employ a more comprehensive bifurcation analysis method introduced in [74,75].  1.   Conventional bifurcation analysis  When dealing with systems responding to a driving force, to generate the points in the bifurcation diagrams vs.   the control parameter, one option is to sample the R(t) curves using a specific point in each driving period. The approach can be summarized in:  P   ≡   ( R (Θ)) { ( R ( t ) ,   ˙ R ( t )) : Θ =   n  f   }   where n   = 400 ,   401 ... 440 (2) Where   P   denotes the points in the bifurcation diagram,  R   and   ˙ R   are the time dependentradius and wall velocity of the bubble at a given set of control parameters of ( R 0 ,   P 0 ,   P A ,   c ,   k ,   μ ,   σ ,   f   ) and Θ is given by   n  f   . Points on the bifurcation diagram are constructed by plotting the solution of   R ( t ) at time points that are multiples of the driving acoustic period.   The results are plotted for  n   = 400   −   440 to ensure a steady state solution has been reached for all bubbles.   Due to smaller viscous effects, bigger bubbles require longer cycles to reach steady state.  2.   Method of peaks  As a more general method, bifurcation points can be constructed by setting one of the phase space coordinates to zero:  Q   ≡   max ( R ) { ( R,   ˙ R ) :   ˙ R   = 0 }   (3) In this method, the steady state solution of the radial oscillations   for   each   control parameter   is   considered. The maxima of the radial peaks (  ˙ R   = 0) are identi- fied   (determined   within   400-440 cycles   of   the   stable oscillations) and are plotted versus the given control parameter in the bifurcation diagrams. The bifurcation diagrams of the normalized bubble oscillations (   R  R 0   ) are calculated using both methods a) and b).   When the two results are plotted alongside each other, it is easier to uncover more important details about the SuH and UH oscillations, as well as the SH and chaotic oscillations.

5  D.   Backscattered pressure  Oscillations of a bubble generates a scattered pressure ( P sc ) which can be calculated by [71]:  P sc   =   ρ  R  d   ( R   ¨ R   + 2  ˙ R 2 )   (4) where   d   is the distance from the center of the bubble (and for simplicity is considered as 1m in this paper) [26].   Equation 1 is solved using the 4th order Runge- Kutta technique using the ode45 function in Matlab (this function also has a 5th order estimation); the control pa- rameters of interest are   R 0 ,   f   and   P A .   The resulting radial bubble oscillations are visualized using resonance curves and bifurcations diagrams. Bifurcation diagrams of the normalized bubble oscillations   R  R 0   are presented as a function of the driving pressure in conjunction with the SH and UH amplitude of the   P sc . The scattered pres- sure ( P sc ) is calculated alongside the bifurcation struc- ture only for pressures that result in non-destructive os- cillations (   R  R 0   <   2) [26,67]. SH and UH amplitude of the  P sc   is plotted alongside each bifurcation diagram to high- light the effect of nonlinearities on the changes in the SH and UH strength.  III.   RESULTS A.   Pressure dependent SH resonance frequency (PDSH)  First we explored the bubble expansion ratio (   R  R 0   ) as a function of peak excitation pressure for a range of fre- quencies between 1.4 f r - 2 f r , where   f r   is the linear res- onance frequency. It has been hypothesized that a local maximum in the expansion ratio would be observed at 2 f r , which would represent the subharmonic response of the bubble. However, the maximum response shifted to lower frequencies as the excitation pressure was increased (Fig. 1). Theoretical studies have reported that the res- onance frequency, which equates to   f r   only at very low excitation pressures (i.e.   <   50 kP a ) for a microbubble is inversely related with excitation pressure. We postulate this can explain the shift in the subharmonic response to lower frequencies relative to 2 f r . Figure 1 shows the SH resonance frequency of a   R 0 =2 μm   bubble sonicated with different pressure amplitudes.   The linear SH resonance frequency is generated at   60 kPa and f=2 f r .   As the pressure increases, similar to the case of pressure depen- dent resonance [26], SH resonance frequency decreases. For example the SH resonance frequency is   ≅   2 f r   at 60 kPa and is 1.7 f r   at 200 kPa. We call this shifted SH res- onance frequency pressure dependent SH resonance fre- quency ( P df sh ).   In the next section, we will show the mechanism of SH enhancement when bubbles of different sizes are sonicated with their   P df sh .  B.   Bifurcation structure of the micron size bubbles (SH enhancement region)  Figures 2a and 2b show the bifurcation structure of the   R 0 =2 μm   and   R 0 =1 μm   bubbles as a function of pres- sure when f=2 f r . The radial oscillations of the bubbles undergo period doubling at the lowest pressure thresh- old (60 kPa for   R 0 =2   μm ), which evolve in the form of a bowtie to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude as the acoustic pressure increases. The oscillations undergo fur- ther period doubling before the appearance of chaos. In this case full amplitude (   R  R 0   =2) P2 non-destructive oscil- lations do not develop. Figures 2c and 2d show the bifurcation structure of the  R 0 =2   μm   and   R 0 =1   μm   bubbles as a function of pres- sure when   f   = 1 . 8 f r .   The radial oscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation from P1 to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude.   The P2 oscillations have one maxi- mum (red curve), above a second pressure threshold the second maximum appears (oscillations become P2 with two maxima);   the maxima are exactly on top of one of the branches of the conventional method which im- plies the wall velocity is in phase with the driving signal once every two acoustic cycles. Compared to the case of  f   =   f sh , bubbles sonicated by their   P df sh   have a higher pressure threshold for P2 oscillations; however, the am- plitude of the P2 oscillations are higher. The oscillations undergo further period doubling and chaos eventually oc- curs. Similar to   f   = 2 f r , when   f   = 1 . 8 f r   full amplitude (   R  R 0   =2) P2 non-destructive oscillations did not develop. Figures 2c and 2d show the bifurcation structure of the  R 0 =2   μm   and   R 0 =1   μm   size bubbles as a function of pressure when   f   = 1 . 6 f r .   The radial oscillations un- dergo a saddle node bifurcation from P2 (with two max- ima) oscillations to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude (with one maxima). Compared to the case of f= f sh , and f=1.8 f r   bubbles sonicated by their   P df sh =1.6 f r   have a higher pressure threshold (Pt) for P2 oscillations (e.g. for   R 0 =2 μm   Pt ≅   230 kPa).   The amplitude of the P2 oscillations are higher than the previous cases at the oc- currence of SN bifurcation (e.g.   for   R 0 =2 μm   P ≅   242 kPa the   R max  R 0   =1.94).b Similar to the previous cases, as pressure increases a second maximum re-emerges in the blue curve with its value being the same as one of the branches of the red curve. P2 oscillations then grow by pressure increase and P2 oscillations reach a large ampli- tude that result in non-destructive oscillations (e.g.   for  R 0 =2 μm   R=1.99   R 0 at   P A   =309 kPa). Figures 2g and 2h show the bifurcation structure of the  R 0 =2   μm   and   R 0 =1   μm   bubbles as a function of pres- sure when   f   = 1 . 5 f r .   PD initiation is at the highest pressure threshold (e.g.   for   R 0 =2 μm   Pd occurs at 245 kPa). Above a second pressure threshold (e.g. for   R 0 =2  μm   at   P A   =295 kPa) P2 oscillations (with two maxima ) undergo a SN bifurcation to P2 oscillations (with two maxima) of higher amplitude ((   R max  R 0   ≅   2 . 13).   In this case occurrence of PD is concomitant with bubble de- struction as   R  R 0   >   2 for both bubbles.

7  C.   Bifurcation structure of the nano-bubbles (SH enhancement region)  Figures 3a and 3b show the bifurcation structure of the bubbles with   R = 0 = 400 nm   &   R 0   = 200 nm   as a func- tion of pressure when   f   = 2 f r . The radial oscillations of the bubbles undergo period doubling at the lowest pres- sure threshold ( ≅   470 kPa for   R 0 =400 nm). P2 oscilla- tions grow in amplitude as pressure increase and undergo further period doubling before the appearance of chaos. When   f   = 2 f r   full amplitude (   R max  R 0   =2) non-destructive P2 oscillations do not develop. Figures 3c and 3d show the bifurcation structure of  R = 0 = 400 nm   &   R 0   = 200 nm   bubbles as a function of pressure when   f   = 1 . 8 f r . P2 oscillations undergo a sharp increase in amplitude (e.g. for   R 0 =400 nm at   P A   ≅ 600 kPa).   Compared to the case of   f   =   f sh , bubbles soni- cated by their   P df sh   have a higher pressure threshold for P2 oscillations; however, the amplitude of the P2 oscil- lations are higher (similar for micron size bubbles in Fig 2c-d). The oscillations undergo further period doubling and chaos eventually occurs.   Similar to   f   = 2 f r , when  f   = 1 . 8 f r , bubble doesnt reach full amplitude (   R max  R 0   =2) P2 non-destructive oscillations (similar to the case of mi- cron size bubbles). Unlike micron size bubbles, SN bifur- cation is not observed; this is due to the stronger effect of liquid viscosity on smaller bubbles. Figures 3e and 3f show the bifurcation structure of the  R 0 =400 nm and   R 0 =200 nm size bubbles as a function of pressure when   f   = 1 . 6 f r . Radial oscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation from P2 oscillations to P2 os- cillations of higher amplitude. Compared to the case of  f   =   f sh , and   f   = 1 . 8 f r , nano-bubbles sonicated by their  P df sh =1.6 f r   have a higher pressure threshold ( P t ) for P2 oscillations (e.g. for   R 0 =400 nm   P t   ≅   570 kP a ). In this case the amplitude of the P2 oscillations are higher than the previous cases after the occurrence of SN bifurcation (e.g.   for   R 0 =400nm   P A   ≅   710 kP a   and (   R max  R 0   = 1 . 86). P2 oscillations then grow as pressure increases and P2 os- cillations reach large amplitude of non-destructive oscil- lations (e.g. for   R 0   = 400 nm R max   = 1 . 98 R 0   at   P A   =976 kPa). Figures 3g and 3h show the bifurcation structure of the  R 0   = 400 nm   and   R 0   = 200 nm   size bubbles as a function of pressure when   f   = 1 . 5 f r . PD initiation is at the high- est pressure threshold (e.g. for   R 0 =400 nm Pd occurs at 597 kPa).   Above a second pressure threshold (e.g.   for  R 0   = 400 nm   at   P A   = 815 kPa) P2 oscillations undergo a SN bifurcation to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude (   R  R 0   ≅   2 . 04). In this case occurrence of PD is concomi- tant with bubble destruction as   R max  R 0   >   2 for both bub- bles.  D.   Enhancement of the SH saturation level  In order to investigate the consequence of the occur- rence of SN on the strength of the SH and UHs of the   P sc , figure 4 displays the bifurcation structure of the bubble with   R 0 =1   μm   when   f   = 2 f r and   f   = 1 . 6 f r   together with the SH and UH amplitude as well as the maximum value of both the   P   2  sc   and   |   ˙ R | . When   f   = 2 f r , PD ( P A   ≅ 135 kPa) is concomitant with SH and UH initiation. Consis- tent with experimental observations [61,62,63], SH and UH component of   P sc   grow quickly with pressure increase and are saturated.   The amplitude of SHs and UHs de- crease simultaneous with P4 oscillations ( P A   ≅   568 kPa) and chaos ( P A   ≅   651 kPa). Chaos result in increase in  P   2  sc   and wall velocity; however, SHs and UHs amplitude of the   P sc   decrease. When   f   = 1 . 6 f r , initiation of SH and UH oscillations are concomitant with P2 generation in the bifurcation diagram ( P A   ≅   310 kPa).   When the SN bifurcation occur( P A   ≅   342kPa), SH and UH amplitude of   P sc   un- dergo a significant increase (4 dB and 10 dB larger than the case of sonication with   f   = 2 f r ).   This results in oversaturation of the SH and UH amplitude.   When  f   = 1 . 6 f r , the occurrence of a SN in the bifurcation diagram is concomitant with a significant increase in the maximum amplitude of   P   2  sc   ( P   2  sc   becomes 88 times larger than its value before the occurrence of SN) . At  P A   =340 kPa (the pressure at the SN bifurcation)   P   2  sc  and maximum wall velocity amplitude are respectively 16.5   P a 2   and 23 m/s larger than the case of sonication with   f   = 2 f r   (by a factor of   ≅   80 and 4 times respec- tively). Moreover, when   f   = 1 . 6 f r , the maximum achiev- able non-destructive (   R  R 0   <   2) SH and UH amplitude are respectively 3.5 and 7 dB larger than the case of   f   = 2 f r . Thus, application of the   P df sh   (in this case   f   = 1 . 6 f r ) resulted in the oversaturation of the SH and UH am- plitude. Maximum non-destructive P2   P   2  sc   and P2 non- destructive wall velocity amplitude are respectively 27 and 26.5 m/s higher than   f   = 2 f r . Figure 5a-d illustrates the SH amplitude of the   P sc   as a function of acoustic pressure at different frequencies ( f   = 2 f r , 1 . 8 f r , 1 . 7 f r , 1 . 6 f r and 1 . 5 f r ) for   R 0 =2   μm  (5a),   R 0 =1   μm   (5b),   R 0 =400 nm (5c) and   R 0 =200 nm (5d).   The SH amplitude of the   P sc   are only shown for non-destructive oscillation regimes where   R  R 0   <   2. When bubbles are sonicated with f=2 f r , SHs are initiated at the lowest pressure, and the SHs amplitude grows with increasing pressure and then saturate.   At higher pres- sures where P4 oscillations or chaos occurs, the SH am- plitude decreases rapidly.   When bubbles are sonicated with their   P df sh , SHs are initiated at higher acoustic pressures.   However, SHs grow rapidly after initiation (concomitant with SN bifurcation) and the SH amplitude becomes larger than the case of sonication with   f   = 2 f r . For the frequencies shown in Fig.   5, the maximum SH amplitude occurs when   f   = 1 . 6 f r   (red line). For all the bubble sizes studied here, when f=1.5 f r (blue line in Fig. 5), the SN bifurcation is concomitant with bubble de- struction (   R  R 0   >   2), therefore sonication with   f   = 1 . 5 f r  does not result in any SH enhancement over the conven- tional method of sonication with   f   = 2 f r . For frequencies less than 2 f r   the bubble undergoes destruction at a lower

Figure 6 displays the maximum non-destructive (   R  R 0   <   2)  P   2  sc   at different   frequencies   (f=2 f r ,   1 . 8 f r ,   1 . 6 f r   and 1 . 5 f r ) for   R 0 =2   μm   (6a),   R 0 =1   μm   (6b),   R 0 =400 nm (6c) and   R 0 =200 nm (6d).   When f=2 f r ,   P   2  sc   is very small for pressures below PD; concomitant with gener- ation of PD,   P   2  sc   undergoes a rapid increase and then increases linearly with acoustic pressure. When P4 oscil- lations occur,   P   2  sc   decreases for micron size bubbles (the growth rate decreases for nano-size bubbles); this is simi- lar to the decrease of   P sc   concomitant with P2 oscillations when f= f r   [26]. Further increase in the acoustic pressure results in chaotic oscillations which lead to significant enhancement of the   P   2  sc ; however, this enhancement in amplitude is associated with a rapid decrease in SH and UH amplitude (Fig 4 and 5). When   f   =   P df sh   ( f   = 1 . 8 f r , 1 . 7 f r   and 1 . 6 f r ),   P   2  sc  is smaller than its counter part when   f   = 2 f r .   Above a pressure threshold, the SN bifurcation results in the generation of higher amplitude P2 oscillations. The SN bifurcation is coincident with a rapid increase in   P   2  sc .   P   2  sc  becomes significantly larger than the case of sonication with   f   = 2 f r   (e.g.   for the bubble with   R 0 =2   μm   and  f   = 1 . 6 f r , when SN occurs at   ≅   242 kPa,   P   2  sc   becomes 8.4 times larger than its counterpart when   f   = 2 f r ). After the SN,   P   2  sc   increase monotonically with pressure

Figure 7 displays the maximum non-destructive wall ve- locity at different frequencies ( f   = 2 f r , 1 . 8 f r , 1 . 6 f r   and 1 . 5 f r ) for   R 0 =2   μm   (6a),   R 0 =1   μm   (6b),   R 0 =400 nm (6c) and   R 0 =200 nm (6d). Maximum wall velocity am- plitude increases monotonically with pressure; however, as soon as PD occurs, the wall velocity undergoes a rapid increase and continues to increase monotonically after. The occurrence of P4 oscillations results in a decrease in the maximum wall velocities for micron size bubbles (or decrease in the growth rate of wall velocity for nano-size bubbles) which is similar to the decrease of wall veloc- ity concomitant with the occurrence of P2 when   f   =   f r  [26]. At higher pressures, the generation of chaotic oscil- lations leads to a rapid increase in wall velocity; however, as seen before this is simultaneous with a decrease in SH and UH amplitudes. For the bubble with   R 0 =0.2   μm   the occurrence of SN bifurcation does not have a pronounced effect on the maximum wall velocity amplitude which is due to the dominant effect of liquid viscosity on smaller bubbles.  E.   Bifurcation structure of the micro-bubbles (for  f r < f <   1 . 5 f r   )  In the previous sections we saw that when   f   ≅   1 . 5 f r , SN bifurcation results in bubble destruction (   R  R 0   >   2) and sonication with 1 . 5 f r < f <   2 f r   results in an enhance- ment of the SH amplitude.   In this section, we closely examine the bifurcation structure of the micro-bubbles when sonicated with   f r   < f <   1 . 5 f r .   Figure 8 shows the bifurcation structure of the micron-size bubbles with  R 0 =2 μm   and   R 0 =1 μm   as a function of pressure.   The frequencies are 1 . 4 f r , 1.2 f r   and 1 . 1 f r .   Unlike the case of sonication with 1 . 5 f r   < f <   2 f r ; within the parame- ter ranges studies here (and for   R  R 0   <   2), there is no SN bifurcation taking place in the diagrams. The evolution of the dynamics of the system is through a simple PD to P2 oscillations followed by a cascade of PDs to chaos. In case of   f   = 1 . 2 f r and 1 . 1 f r   full amplitude (   R max  R 0   =2) non- destructive P2 oscillations are developed; however, un- like 1 . 5 f r   < f <   2 f r , PD is simultaneous with a decrease in wall velocity and scattered pressure.   We have previ- ously shown that when bubble is sonicated with   f   =   f r , the occurrence of PD is concomitant with a decrease in the scattered pressure and maximum wall velocity [26]. The red curve in figure 8 (constructed by conventional method) never meets the blue curve (constructed by the maxima method) suggesting that the wall velocity of the

F.   Bifurcation structure of the nano-bubbles (for  f r   < f <   1 . 5 f r   )  Figure 9 shows the bifurcation structure of the nano- size bubbles as a function of pressure. Bubbles have ini- tial radii of   R 0 = 400nm (left column) and   R 0 =200nm (right column). When   f   = 1 . 4 f r , P1 bubble oscillations grow monotonically with increasing pressure and above a pressure threshold bubbles undergo a PD to P2 oscil- lations.   P2 oscillations grow in amplitude and above a second pressure threshold; there is a SN bifurcation to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude. The SN bifurcation re- sults in P2 oscillations that are resonant (one of the max- ima in blue curve is on top of one of the branches of the red curve), however, similar to the case of the   f   = 1 . 5 f r , the SN results in bubble destruction (   R max  R 0   >   2). When  f   = 1 . 2 f r   and   f   = 1 . 1 f r , SN bifurcation does not take place and the bubble oscillations undergo a PD bifurca- tion to P2 oscillations followed by a cascade of PDs to chaos.  G.   Maximum achievable   P   2  sc , wall velocity, SH and UH as a function of frequency  In many applications, it is of interest to find exposure parameters that maximize the scattered pressure or en- hances a specific frequency component in the scattered pressure. Figure 10a-b show the normalized value of max- imum non-destructive   P   2  sc   (   R  R 0   <   2) and wall velocity in the regime of P2 oscillations as a function of frequency.  P   2  sc   and wall velocity reach their maximum at   f   = 1 . 6 f r  for bubbles with   R 0 =0.4, 1 and 2 μm   and it is maximum for   f   = 1 . 65 f r   when   R 0 =0.2   μm . For all bubbles there is a universal minimum for   P   2  sc   and wall velocity when  f   = 1 . 5   −   1 . 55 f r . We show that conventional practice of sonication with SH resonance frequency ( f sh =2 f r ) does not lead to the generation of the maximum P2 scattered pressure or wall velocity.   Instead there is a frequency range (1 . 55   < f <   1 . 7) that results in the maximum value of the two parameters.   Figure 10c-d presents the max- imum non-destructive (   R  R 0   <   2) SH and UH amplitude as a function of frequency.   For all bubble sizes exam- ined, the conventional sonication with the   f sh (2 f r   ) does not result in the strongest SH or UH amplitude.   The bubble with   R 0 =2 μm   reaches the strongest SH and UH amplitude when   f   = 1 . 6 f r ; the bubbles with   R 0 =1 μm  and   R 0 =0.4 μm   reach the maximum at   f   = 1 . 55 f r . For bubbles with   R 0 =2 μm , 1 μm   and 0.4 μm   there exist a uni-

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY  SH oscillation of bubbles are one of the most impor- tant nonlinear signatures of bubbles which are used in several medical and industrial applications [18-23,38-52]. Despite the importance of SH oscillations, most studies have only focused on investigating the minimum pressure threshold for SH oscillations [56-59,61-65]. Conditions to maximize the SH power remain uncertain.   When the bubble is sonicated with twice its linear resonance fre- quency ( f r ), SHs are developed at the lowest pressure threshold [55-59]. SHs grow quickly above this pressure threshold, however, they are saturated and any further increase in incident pressure may even lead to weaken- ing of the SHs due to the occurrence of chaos or bubble destruction.   Knowledge of the conditions and exposure parameters that enhance the saturation level would allow to select exposure parameters that increase the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) in applications.   We have previously studied the two main routes of period doubling (PD) in the bubble oscillator and showed that due to the very high oscillation ampli- tude (   R  R 0   >   2 [67] and a for detailed review please see the discussion in [26]), non-destructive SH oscillations are less likely to be developed when bubbles are sonicated with   f r .   However, sonication with   f sh =2 f r , results in the generation of SHs at very gentle oscillation regimes which increases the chance of the bubble survival during SH regime of oscillations. We have also previously shown that the scattered signal from bubbles can be enhanced if the bubbles are sonicated with its pressure dependent res- onance frequency [26]. In this work the bifurcation struc- ture of bubbles sonicated by its pressure dependent reso- nance frequencies ( P df sh ) was investigated in detail. SH and UH amplitudes were examined between two pressure limits: The threshold for the onset of SH oscillations and the critical pressure at which the nonlinear response be- comes chaotic (or results in bubble destruction). Knowl- edge of these limits is essential for the optimization of applications related to SHs as the SH amplitude drops rapidly when chaos occurs.   The findings of this study can be summarized as follows: 1- When bubbles are sonicated with   f sh =2 f r , bubble oscillations undergo period doubling (PD) at the low- est pressure threshold.   Period 2 (P2) oscillations re- sult in the generation of SHs and UHs which then grow

Left column is for   R 0   = 2 μm   and Right column is for   R 0   = 1 μm   (arrow shows the pressure responsible for SN bifurcation)  quickly with increasing pressure reaching a saturation value.   Thus, there is an upper limit of achievable SH and UH strength under conventional exposure parame- ters for SH imaging. 2- When sonicated with   f sh   or   P df s h , the occurrence of P4 or chaotic oscillations lead to a drop in the SH and UH amplitude. Thus, in a clinical setting CTR de- creases for these exposure conditions. Furthermore since P4 and chaos occur at higher acoustic pressures, higher backscatter from tissue will result in a decrease of bub- ble contrast enhancement compared to the tissue signal. Thus, the limit for the occurrence of P4 or chaos should be determined and avoided in practical situations where the goal is higher CTR and SNR. 3- Pressure increase leads to a decrease in SH resonance frequency.   This is similar to the decrease in resonance frequency with pressure [26]. 4- When the bubble is sonicated with   P df s h , PD initia- tion is at higher pressures compared to   f   =   f sh . Bubble oscillations undergo a SN bifurcation from P1 to P2 or from a P2 to P2 oscillations of higher amplitude. This is concomitant with a rapid growth of signal and oversatu- ration of the SH level. 5- When   f   =   P df s h , the SN bifurcation results in a sud- den increase in the scattered pressure and wall velocity; this effect is more pronounced in bubbles   >   800 nm   as

Left column is for   R 0   = 0 . 4 μm   and Right column is for   R 0   = 0 . 2 μm  (arrow shows the pressure responsible for SN bifurcation)  the higher viscous forces on smaller bubbles increases the pressure required for the onset of nonlinear oscillations. 6- In this study for bubble sizes   >   800 nm , the maximum non-destructive SH, UH, backscatter pressure and wall velocity are generated when bubbles are sonicated with f ≅ 1.55-1.6 f r .   Conversely, there is a universal minimum for all these values at f ≅ 1.4-1.5 f r . 7- When sonicated with 1 . 5 f r   < f <   2 f r , the occurrence of PD is concomitant with an increase in the wall velocity and scattered pressure. This is in contrast to sonication with   f r   < f <   1 . 5 f r , where PD is simultaneous with a drop in scattered pressure and wall velocity. We have also previously shown that when bubble is sonicated with its pressure dependent resonance ( P Df r   ) and   f   =   f r , the maximum wall velocity drops when PD occurs [26]. This can be one of the reasons for the loss of echogenecity ob- served concomittant with Pd [72] 8- When sonicated with 1 . 5 f r   < f   <   2 f r , the occur- rence of P4 or chaotic oscillations lead to an increase in maximum scattered pressure and wall velocity; however, this increase is simultaneous with a drop in SH and UH strength; thus it is not an ideal situation for SH imaging applications. 9- For bubble sizes   >   400 nm   when sonicated with   f r   < f   <   1 . 5 f r ; oscillations undergo a simple PD from P1 to P2 oscillations which is followed by a PD cascade to

We have shown that exposure parameters ( f   = 2 f r ) that are used in conventional SH imaging do not result in the maximum SH or UH strength.   We conclude that soni- cation with   f   ≅   1 . 6 f r   generates the highest achievable non-destructive (   R  R 0   <   2) SH and UH amplitude (e.g. depending on pressure, for the bubble with   R 0 =1 μm   the enhancement in SH and UH were respectively 3.5-4 dB and 7-10 dB). In this paper, we have derived the exposure parameters that maximize the enhancement of the SHs, UHs, scat- tered pressure and wall velocities. The fundamental find- ings of this study can be used to optimize the outcome of ultrasound applications based on SH oscillations. Fur- thermore, in drug delivery applications, sonication pa- rameters that lead to non-destructive oscillations with elevated wall velocities can be used to increase the long lasting shear stress on the nearby cells. SN bifurcation is concomitant with a fast increase in the scattered pressure.   For example when the bubble with  R 0 =1 μm   was sonicated with   f   = 1 . 6 f r   scattered pres- sure underwent a 9.4 times increase as soon as SN oc- curred (Fig.   6b).   This has several advantages for am- plitude modulation imaging used in medical ultrasound [73-75].   Amplitude modulation (AM) is a method that takes advantage of the nonlinear response of the bub- ble to increase in acoustic pressure; in this method, two pulses are sent to the target with one having twice the amplitude of the other. The signals are scaled and sub- tracted upon return.   Because of the linear response of tissue to pressure increase the signal from the tissue can- cels and the residual signal from the bubble enhances the CTR. When bubble is sonicated with   P df sh , sonication with pressures below and above the pressure threshold for the SN can significantly enhance the residual signal; furthermore, because of the higher frequencies of PDsfh compared to conventional AM sonication at   f r , higher resolution is expected. In this paper, we have analyzed the nonlinear dynamics of the free bubble in the absence of coating (shell). Coated bubbles and most importantly lipid shell bubbles [76] are used in medical applications of ultrasound from SH imag- ing [40] to blood brain barrier opening [46] and throm- bolysis [77]. The nonlinear behavior of lipid coating (e.g. buckling and rupture) makes the dynamics of the bubble system more complex. In other words, the nonlinear shell dynamics are interwoven with the inherent nonlinear be- havior of the bubble. This makes it very difficult to un- derstand the behavior of the system and decouple effects due to the shell compared to nonlinear effects inherent in the forced bubble oscillator. It has been shown exper- imentally and numerically [40,52,78-84] that addition of the lipid shell reduces the pressure threshold for nonlinear oscillations including SH oscillations [59,64-65]. Followed

15 by experimental observations of the pressure threshold of SH oscillations [78] and numerical results [64-65], Pros- peretti [59] theoretically investigated the SH threshold of coated bubbles.   He showed that consistent with ex- perimental observations [78], the SH threshold can be considerably lowered with respect to that of an uncoated free bubble. This happens when the mechanical response of the coating varies rapidly in the neighbourhood of cer- tain specific values of the bubble radius (e.g. changes in shell parameters due to buckling of the shell [76]). In this paper, we have neglected the shell effects. To bet- ter understand the dynamics of the more complex coated bubble, we first need to establish the nonlinear response of the less complex uncoated system. In this regard, un- derstanding the nonlinear dynamics of the bubble system in the absence of the shell is the first step in developing a comprehensive framework for the understanding of the complex nonlinear behavior of bubbles.   Future studies will include the effect of coating and since we know the behavior of the free bubble system, it is much easier to understand the shell effects on the bubble system. We have neglected the effects of thermal damping [85- 88].   Thermal damping especially in bigger bubbles can potentially have a strong effect on the dynamics of the system and changes the resonant behavior of the sys- tem. At higher frequencies (above resonance), the effect of thermal damping is weaker and neglecting the thermal effects in this paper may not change the general conclu- sions presented here. A more complete understanding of the thermal damping, however, is necessary for accurate prediction of the bubble behavior.   Another important factor that should be considered is the interaction be- tween bubbles [89-93].   In applications bubbles exist in poly-disperse clusters and their oscillations affect each other.   We have recently shown that SH behavior of a polydisperse interacting cluster of bubbles is dictated by the SH response of the bigger bubbles in the cluster. Con- clusions of this study can be useful in optimizing the SH strength of a poly-disperse cluster by optimizing the ex- posure parameters required to enhance the SH response of the clusters bigger bubbles.
