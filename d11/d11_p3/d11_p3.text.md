                                                     Boundary feedback stabilization of a critical, nonlinear Jordan–Moore–Gibson–Thompson
                                                 (JMGT) equation is considered. JMGT arises in modeling of acoustic waves involved in medi-

                                                 using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). It is a well-established and recently widely stud-

                                                 Equation (PDE) with the distinctive feature of predicting the propagation of ultrasound waves
                                                 at finite speed due to heat phenomenon know as second sound which leads to the hyperbolic
                                                 character of heat propagation. In practice, the JMGT dynamics is largely used for modeling the
                                                 evolution of the acoustic velocity and, most importantly, the acoustic pressure as sound waves
                                                 propagate through certain media. In this work, critical refers to (usual) case where media–
                                                 damping effects are non–existent or non–measurable and therefore cannot be relied upon for
                                                 stabilization purposes.
                                                     In this paper the issue of boundary stabilizability of originally unstable (JMGT) equation is
                                                 resolved. Motivated by modeling aspects in HIFU technology, boundary feedback is supported
                                                 only on a portion of the boundary, while the remaining part of the boundary is left free (available
                                                 to control actions) . Since the boundary conditions imposed on the "free" part of the boundary
                                                 fail to satisfy Lopatinski condition (unlike Dirichlet boundary conditions), the analysis of uniform
                                                 stabilization from the boundary becomes very subtle and requires careful geometric considerations.

                                           1     Introduction

                                           1.1    PDE Model and an Overview
                                           Let Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 2, 3) denote a bounded domain with suﬃciently smooth boundary Γ := ∂Ω within
                                           which a sound wave propagates. In HIFU technology, as well as in other contexts, one is interested

                                                                                                  1
in tracking – and often controlling – the evolution of the acoustic pressure u = u(t, x) (t ∈ R+ , x ∈ Ω)
caused by such wave propagation. In media on which heat propagates hyperbolically (which is the
case of most biological tissues), the evolution of the acoustic pressure can be assumed to obey the
semilinear JMGT–equation which is given by the third order in time abstract evolution equation

                          τ uttt + (α − 2ku)utt − c2 ∆u − (δ + τ c2 )∆ut = 2ku2t ,                  (1.1)

where c, δ, k > 0 are constants representing the speed and diﬀusivity of sound and a nonlinearity
parameter, respectively, while the function α : Ω → R+ accounts for natural frictional damping
provided by the media. The parameter τ > 0 – also media–dependent – accounts for thermal
relaxation and essentially transfers the hyperbolicity of the heat to the acoustic wave.
    The semilinear equation (1.1) can be viewed as a singular perturbation and, to some extent, a
refinement of the classical quasilinear Westervelt’s equation

                                  (α − 2ku)utt − c2 ∆u − δ∆ut = 2ku2t .                             (1.2)

obtained by setting τ = 0. Physically, the main diﬀerence between (1.1) and (1.2) is that the latter
predicts that these waves propagate at a ﬁnite speed. From the modeling point of view this results
from using Maxwell-Cattaneo Law – rather than Fourrier’s Law – to model a heat ﬂux for acoustic
heat waves. The parameter τ > 0 corresponds to time relaxation. For more about the physical
interpretation of (1.1), its derivation and overall discussion see [6, 19, 10, 11, 42, 13, 20].This also
includes an analysis of asymptotic behavior of solutions when the parameter of relaxation tends to
zero [26, 27, 4, 3]
    The issues of wellposedness and stability of solutions under homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary data were ﬁrst addressed for both nonlinear and linearized (k = 0) dynamics around 2010
with the works of I. Lasiecka, R. Triggiani and B. Kaltenbacher [23, 24, 36, 25]. For the analysis of
the long–time dynamics of (1.1) for both linear and nonlinear cases, the function

                                                                    τ c2
                                   γ : Ω → R,       γ(x) ≡ α(x) −                                   (1.3)
                                                                     b
plays a central role. In fact, the existence of a positive constant γ0 such that γ(x) ⩾ γ0 > 0 a.e. in Ω
ensures both that linear dynamics is uniformly exponentially stable and that stable nonlinear ﬂows
can be constructed via “barriers” [25] method. A natural question, in light of the above results, is
concerning the other proﬁles of γ. It is known that if γ < 0 one may have chaotic solutions [14] and if
γ ≡ 0 then the energy is conserved [24, 23]. This raises the interesting question of what mechanisms
could be employed to ensure stability of the dynamics when γ degenerates, i.e., γ(x) ⩾ 0.
    From a practical point of view, the quantity γ(x) is interpreted as the viscoelasticity of the
material point x ∈ Ω and, in particular in the medical ﬁeld, is not expected to be known for all
points of Ω. By making the physically relevant assumption that γ ∈ L∞ (Ω), γ(x) ⩾ 0 a.e. in Ω
(allowing the critical case γ ≡ 0, or the case where measurements can only me made at isolated
points of the domain), we ask ourselves whether a non–invasive (boundary) action can drive the
acoustic pressure to zero at large times regardless of the particular knowledge of γ (as long as it is
nonnegative). This question, besides being of independent interest in stability theory, is critical in

                                                     2
ensuring global wellposedness of nonlinear solutions. Otherwise the nonlinearity may cause "blow" up
of solutions [12].
    It has been recently shown that viscoelastic eﬀects produces, in some cases, the asymptotic
decay of the energy, cf. e.g. [33, 34, 15, 18, 17, 16]. In this work we concentrate on a physically
attractive boundary stabilization – where control action can be applied on the boundary, hence easily
accessible to external manipulations. Of particular interest is a conﬁguration arising in the ultrasound
technology where an acoustic medium is excited on one part of the boundary, while the remaining
part of the boundary is subject to absorbing boundary conditions.This control model was introduced
in [22, 21] in the case of Westervelt-Kuznetsov equation and later pursued in [9] for MGT equation.
This corresponds to the following boundary conditions

                        λ∂ν u + κ0 (x)u = 0 on Σ0       ∂ν u + κ1 (x)ut = 0 on Σ1                    (1.4)

with Γ0 , Γ1 ⊂ Γ relatively open, Γ0 6= ∅, Γ0 ∪Γ1 = Γ, Γ0 ∩Γ1 = ∅, λ > 0, κ0 ∈ L∞ (Γ0 ) and κ1 ∈ L∞ (Γ1 ),
κ1 (x) ≥ κ1 > 0, κ0 > 0 a.e.
    Notice that the boundary condition (1.4)1 – where there is no dissipation –, do not satisfy strong
Lopatinski condition, a fact that leads to new challenges at the level of proving controllability or
stabilization even for a wave equation in dimension higher than one. The technical (mathematical)
reason is that the presence of tangential boundary derivatives cannot be handled by standard ﬂow
multipliers methods. In fact, past contributions to the subject include [5, 6] where linear dynamics is
considered in the case λ = 0 and κ0 ≡ κ1 ≡ 1 in (1.4). Thus, the uncontrolled part of the boundary
is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions where Lopatinski condition is satisﬁed and tangential
derivatives (appearing in the applications of ﬂux multipliers) vanish altogether on Γ0 . In [5] star–
shaped boundary condition is assumed on Γ1 . This restriction has been removed in [7] by resorting
to a microlocal analysis argument.
    The present paper addresses the challenging case of a nonlinear, critical JMGT dynamics subject
to Neuman/Robin boundary conditions on the undissipated part of the boundary Γ0 (λ = 1). The model
is important in the context of HIFU control theory where boundary open loop strategic control is
activated precisely on this “free” part of the boundary. On the other hand, in such case one encounters
a well recognized PDE predicament: seeking stabilization for a hyperbolic dynamics when Lopatinski
condition [39, 40] fails on undissipated portion of the boundary. This leads to major diﬃculties
when applying ﬂux multipliers or geometric optics in order to carry the analysis of uniform stability.
Clearly, one expects some restrictions on the geometry of the boundary to cooperate. In the case
of Dirichlet boundary conditions, star–shaped condition suﬃces. Instead, for the Neumann case
(non–Lopatinski), it turns out that star–shaped along with some convexity is a suﬃcient condition.
Precise formulation of the corresponding results will be given in the next section. In addition to
new geometric constructs, nonlinearity in the model forces considering stability properties at higher
topological levels with a restricted “smallness” condition imposed on the initial data. The key point
here is that this would make the model “close” to linear. In order to contend with this limitation,
the results presented require smallness conditions imposed only at the low energy level, while higher
derivatives can remain large. We will be able to achieve this goal through boundary dissipation and
small initial data imposed only at the lowest energy level. So the model and the resulting acoustic

                                                    3
waves remain genuinely nonlinear.

2     Main Results and Discussion.

We consider the system comprised of (1.1), boundary conditions (1.4) and initial conditions

                            u(0, ·) = u0 ,       ut (0, ·) = u1 ,        utt (0, ·) = u2          (2.1)

with regularity to be speciﬁed in what follows.
   Here and throughout the paper, by L2 (Ω) and L2 (Γ) we denote the sets of measurable (in the
Lebesgue and Hausdorﬀ senses, respectively) functions whose squares are integrable on Ω and Γ
respectively equipped with the norms induced by the inner products
                                       Z                    Z
                              (u, v) =   uvdΩ and (u, v)Γ = uvdΓ.

and denoted respectively by k · k2 and k · kΓ . The remaining Lp (Ω)–spaces (1 ⩽ p ⩽ ∞) will also have
their norms denoted by k · kp . Additionally, by H s (Ω) we denote the (L2 –based) Sobolev space of
order s and deﬁne the particular spaces HΓ1 (Ω) and HΓ2 (Ω) as
                            
                   HΓ1 (Ω) = u ∈ H 1 (Ω); u|Γ = 0           and HΓ2 (Ω) = H 2 (Ω) ∩ HΓ1 (Ω)

in order to avoid confusion with the standard H01 (Ω).


2.1    Functional Analytic Setting.
Let A : D(A) ⊂ L2 (Ω) → L2 (Ω) be the operator deﬁned as
                                 
                 Aξ = −∆ξ, D(A) = ξ ∈ H 2 (Ω); ∂ν ξ|Γ1 = 0, [∂ν ξ + κ0 ξ]Γ0 ] = 0 .               (2.2)
                                                                                                     
In this setting, A is a positive, self–adjoint operator with compact resolvent and for κ0 > 0, D A1/2 =
H 1 (Ω) with the – equivalent to H 1 (Ω) – topology of D(A1/2 ) given by
                                                            Z
                                        2               2
                                    kukD(A1/2 ) := k∇uk2 +     κ0 |u|2 dΓ0 .
                                                                    Γ0

In addition, with some abuse of notation we (also) denote by A : L2 (Ω) → [D(A)]′ the extension (by
duality) of the operator A.
   Let us introduce the phase space H given by

                    H := D(A1/2 ) × D(A1/2 ) × L2 (Ω) ∼ H 1 (Ω) × H 1 (Ω) × L2 (Ω).               (2.3)

Next, we rewrite (1.1) along with (1.4) and (2.1) as a ﬁrst–order abstract system on H. For this,
we introduce the classic boundary → interior harmonic extension for the Neumann data on Γ1 as

From elliptic theory, it follows that that N ∈ L(H s (Γ1 ), H s+3/2 (Ω)) (s ∈ R) and
                                                 

for all ξ ∈ D(A), where N ∗ represents the adjoint of N when it is considered as an operator from
L2 (Γ1 ) to L2 (Ω) [31].
    Thus, the u–problem can be written (via duality on [D(A)]′ ) as

             τ uttt + αutt + c2 Au + bAut + c2 AN(κ1 N ∗ Aut ) + bAN(κ1 N ∗ Autt ) = u2t + uutt        (2.6)

where we have taken k = 1/2 without any loss of generality.
   Next, we introduce the operator A : D(A) ⊂ H → H with the action:

    In order to treat nonlinear problem one needs to consider “smoother” solutions than generated
by the topology of H. This leads ton the following construction of the second phase space denoted

                                                     5
by H1 , which is “thighter” than H but strictly larger than D(A).The new phase space H1 is deﬁned
below
                 H1 = {ξ~ ∈ H; ∆ξ1 ∈ L2 (Ω); [λ∂ν ξ1 + κ0 ξ1 ]Γ0 = 0; [∂ν ξ1 + κ1 ξ2 ]Γ1 = 0} (2.10)
and endowed with the norm

                           ~ 2 = kξk
                          kξk     ~ 2 + k∆ξ1 k2 + kξ1 k2 1/2              2

or equivalently
                                  ~ 2 = kξk
                                 kξk     ~ 2 + k∆ξ1 k2 + k∂ν ξ1 k2 1/2
                                     H1     H        2           H     (Γ)

Note that the boundary conditions in the deﬁnition of the space H1 are well deﬁned due to the
property: ∆ξ1 ∈ L2 (Ω) and ξ1 ∈ H 1 (Ω) then ∂ν ξ1 ∈ H −1/2 (Γ) – the latter allowing to deﬁne the
boundary conditions as a distribution. We also note that since ξ1 , ξ2 ∈ H 1 (Ω) we have ξi |Γ ∈ H 1/2 (Γ)
(i = 1, 2) and therefore ∂ν ξ1 ∈ H 1/2 (Γ). This along with the elliptic regularity implies:

                                      H1 ⊂ H 2 (Ω) × H 1 (Ω) × L2 (Ω)

with a proper but not dense injection. We shall show that the operator A also generates a C0 –
semigroup {T (t)}t⩾0 on H1 . Notice that the nonlinear term is invariant under H1 topology in dimen-
sions up to 3.


2.2    Main Results
Our ﬁrst preliminary result is stated below.

Theorem 2.1. The operator A generates a C0 –semigroup {S(t)}t⩾0 on H. Moreover, the family
T (t) := S(t)|H1 , t ⩾ 0, is also a C0 –semigroup with generator A and its realization on H1 .

    The second result deals with an exponential stability of the semigroups on the phase space H and
H1 . For this, one needs to introduce the following geometric condition.

Assumption 1. The boundary Γ0 is star–shaped and convex. This is to say: there exists x0 ∈ Rn
such that (x − x0 ) · ν(x) ⩽ 0 for all x ∈ Γ0 where (x) is the outwards normal vector to the boundary
at x. In addition, there exists a convex level set function which defines Γ0 . See [32].

Theorem 2.2 (Two level uniform stability). Let Assumption 1 on Γ0 be in force and let γ(x) ⩾ 0.
Then (i) the semigroup {S(t)}t⩾0 generated by A in H is uniformly exponentially stable with decay
rate ω0 > 0 and (ii) the semigroup {T (t)}t⩾0 generated by A in H1 is uniformly exponentially stable
with decay rate ω1 > 0, where ω1 < ω0 .

   Once linear wellposedness and uniform stability of the linear (k = 0) problem are established with
respect to the appropriate topologies, our next task is to prove generation of nonlinear semigroup
on H1 . To accomplish this, initial data need to be assumed suﬃciently small. How small? This is
an important question as argued in [4]. We will be able to show that some smallness will be only
imposed at the lowest level of regularity, while higher derivatives can be large. As a consequence, in

                                                      6
the following theorem we show existence of H1 –valued solutions given H1 initial data which are small
in H only. The proof, given in Section 5, relies on estimates derived via interpolation inequalities
which allows to demonstrate certain “invariance” of a H-small ball under the nonlinear dynamics in
H1 .
     We start specifying the notion of solution for the semilinear problem (1.1) supplemented with
(1.4) and (2.1). We denote the initial data here by Φ0 = (u0 , u1 , u2 )⊤ . Given T > 0, we say that

                                              Φ(t) = (u(t), ut (t), utt (t))

is a mild solution for the system (1.1), (1.4) and (2.1) provided Φ ∈ C([0, T ], H1 ) and
                                               Z t
                              Φ(t) = T (t)Φ0 +     T (t − τ )F (Φ)(τ )dτ,                        (2.11)
                                                          0

      Before stating the theorem, we denote by Hρ (for ρ > 0) the set

                                            Hρ := {Φ ∈ H1 ; kΦkH < ρ} .

Theorem 2.3 (Global Solutions). Let Assumption 1 on Γ0 be in force. Then, there exists ρ > 0
sufficiently small such that, given any Φ0 ∈ Hρ the formula (2.11) defines a continuous H1 –valued mild
solution for the system (1.1), (1.4) and (2.1). Moreover, for such ρ > 0, there exists R = R(kΦ0 kH1 )
such that all trajectories starting in BHρ (0, R)1 remain in BHρ (0, R1 ) for all t ⩾ 0, R1 > R.

   Once global solutions are shown to exist, we take on the issue of asymptotic (in time) stability.
The ﬁnal result is positive, as we expected, and holds uniformly (w.r.t γ) as long as γ ∈ L∞ (Ω) and
γ(x) ⩾ 0 a.e. in Ω.

Theorem 2.4 (Nonlinear Uniform Stability). Let Assumption 1 on Γ0 be in force and assume
γ ∈ L∞ (Ω) and γ(x) ⩾ 0. Then, there exists ρ > 0 sufficiently small and M(ρ), ω > 0 such that if
Φ0 ∈ Hρ then
                            kΦ(t)kH1 ⩽ M(ρ)e−ωt kΦ0 kH1 ,      t⩾0                         (2.12)
where Φ is the mild solution given by Theorem 2.3.

    We notice that repeating the statement there exists ρ > 0 such that if Φ0 ∈ Hρ in the Theorem
above is not redundant. In fact, one might need to require even smaller initial data to yield expo-
nential decay. This again highlights the advantage of requiring smallness only in H. For more details,
see Section 6.


2.3       Discussion
The main novelty of this paper is that we study stabilizability of a nonlinear critical JMGT equation
with Neumann–Robin undissipated portion of the boundary. Should the problem be subcritical (i.e.
γ(x) > γ0 > 0 for x ∈ Ω, the diﬃculty created by the failure of Lopatinski condition would not enter
  1
      The Hρ –ball centered at the origin and with radius R.


                                                              7
the picture. Simply because there will be no need to propagate stability from the boundary into
the interior. As already mentioned before, linear dynamics with absorbing boundary conditions on
Γ1 and zero Dirichlet data on Γ0 subject to star–shaped conditions has been considered in [5, 7].
Mathematical diﬃculties in propagating stability through the undissipated part of the boundary are
not present in this case. In order to cope with the diﬃculties we shall employ geometric constructs
developed earlier in [32]. These allow to construct suitable–non–radial–vector ﬁelds which result from
tangential bending of radial and star–shaped ones. These newly constructed ﬁelds propagate the
needed estimates through un–dissipated part of the boundary.
   In order to treat the nonlinear problem, the approach used in the past (for subcritical case) was
to use the so called “barrier’s method” based on contradiction argument. However, this presents
several technical diﬃculties in the present scenario, even at the level of low frequencies (lower order
terms). Hence, in this paper, we exploit another technique which, to the best of our knowledge, is
new and makes a strong use of the fact that we only require initial data to be small in H. One of the
advantages of such construction (for JMGT) was already exploited by the authors in [4] in allowing
extension by density in the nonlinear environment. In this paper we discovered that it also allows to:

    a) prove global existence and exponential stability by the representation of the solution and two-
       level stability of linear ﬂows. Here, the smallness interplay comes to the picture through a
       nonlinear propagation of the estimate of the type

                                       kF (Φ)kH1 ⩽ C1 (kΦkH )C2 (|ΦkH1 .)                         (2.13)

       where the size of C1 (kΦkH ) can be controlled by ρ. See Theorem 2.3.

    b) obtain, to some extent, a continuity property of the decay rate with respect to the H–size of
       the initial data and the decay rate of the linear ﬂow, ω1 . In general, we prove that if ε is the
       H–size of the initial data and ω(ε) is the corresponding decay rate, then there exists ω(ε) such
       that ω(ε) ⩾ ω(ε) and ω(ε) → ω1 as ε → 0+ .

     The rest of this paper is devoted to the proofs.

    We ﬁrst show that A : D(A) ⊂ H → H generates a C0 semigroup on H. This part of the argument
follows essentially [7] with some rather straigthforward modiﬁcations. We shall outline the main
details – as these are needed for the proof of generation on the higher level of H1 topology.

Proof. We only check the matching of the boundary conditions.               Assume that Ψ = (u, z, zt ) ∈
C 1 (0, T ; H) ∩ C(0, T ; D(A)) is a strong solution for (3.4). Let

                                  Υ(t) := (λ∂ν u(t) + κ0 u(t))|Γ0 , t ⩾ 0

and notice that bΥt + c2 Υ = 0 for all t. This along with the compatibility condition (3.2)1 (Υ(0) = 0)
implies that Υ ≡ 0. The same argument mutatis mutandis recovers the boundary condition for u on
Γ1 .

semigroup on H, from which the semigroup generated by A can be recovered via M. The semigroup

where D(Ad ) := D(A). It then suﬃces to prove generation of Ad on H, see [37, p. 76] and this will
be done by verifying the hypothesis of Lummer Philips Theorem: dissipativity and maximality.

hence, Ad is dissipative in H.
   For maximality in H, given any L = (f, g, h) ∈ H we need to ﬁnd Ψ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 )⊤ ∈ D(A) such
that (s − Ad )Ψ = L, for some s > 0. This is equivalent to solving

which readily implies

                                       ξ1 =      f ∈ D(A1/2 ).
                                         bs + c2
Moreover, since A−1 ∈ L(L2 (Ω)) a combination of the second and third equations above yields

                                            Ks ξ3 = sA−1 h − bg                                 (3.9)

                                                        10
where Ks : L2 (Ω) → L2 (Ω) acts on an element ξ ∈ L2 (Ω) as
                                                                   
                             Ks ξ = (s2 + s)A−1 + b(I + sN(κ1 N ∗ A) ξ.

   We now notice the restriction Ks |D(A1/2 ) is strictly positive. Indeed it follows by (2.5) that, given
ξ ∈ D(A1/2 ) we have

                (Ks ξ, ξ)D(A1/2) = (s2 + s)kξk22 + bkA1/2 ξk22 + bs(A1/2 N(κ1 N ∗ A)ξ, A1/2 ξ)
                                                                    √
                                 = (s2 + s)kξk22 + bkA1/2 ξk22 + bsk κ1 N ∗ Aξk2Γ1 > 0.

   Therefore Ks −1
                D(A1/2 )
                         ∈ L(D(A1/2 )) and since sA−1 h − bg ∈ D(A1/2 ) we have that

                                     ξ3 := Ks−1 (sA−1 h − bg) ∈ D(A1/2 )

is the solution of (3.9). Finally,
                                        ξ2 = s−1 (ξ3 + g) ∈ D(A1/2 ).
    For the ﬁnal step to conclude membership of (ξ1, ξ2 , ξ3 ) in D(A) we look at the abstract version
of the description of D(A):
                                
                        D(A) = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3)⊤ ∈ H; ξ2 + N(κ1 N ∗ Aξ3 ) ∈ D(A)

whereby one only needs to check that ξ2 + N(κ1 N ∗ Aξ3 ) ∈ D(A) since the regularity for the triple
(ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3)⊤ to belong to H was already established. The desired regularity will follow from (3.8),
which implies

                       bs(ξ2 + N(κ1 N ∗ Aξ3 )) = −(s2 + s)A−1 ξ3 + sA−1 h ∈ D(A),

since ξ3 , h ∈ L2 (Ω).
    This proves that Ad is maximal dissipative, therefore generates a C0 –semigroup of contractions
due to Lummer Phillips Theorem and, since P is bounded, A = Ad + P generates a C0 –semigroup on
H.
    For generation in H1 we use an argument inspired by the one presented in ([36], p. 26) with the
needed modiﬁcations. Since we already know that A generates a C0 semigroup {S(t)}t⩾0 on a larger
space H, we only show that
                                     {T (t)}t⩾0 := {S(t)|H1 }t⩾0
is also a semigroup and that its inﬁnitesimal generator is A when considered as an operator in H1 .
    This entails the proof of two things: {T (t)}t⩾0 satisﬁes the semigroup property – which follows
from the fact that the problem is autonomous – and invariance: T (t)(H1 ) ⊂ H1 for all t ⩾ 0.
    If Φ0 = (u0, u1 , u2 )⊤ ∈ H1 then ∂ν u0 + k1 u1 = 0 on Γ1 . We then need to show that this
condition is invariant under the dynamics and, in addition, the regularity ∆u ∈ C ([0, T ); L2 (Ω))
holds true. This along with the boundary conditions and regularity of elliptic problems will prove
that u ∈ C([0, T ); H 2(Ω)). In order to show that ∆u ∈ C ([0, T ); L2(Ω)), we appeal to the change of
variables bzt = but + c2 u. By the variation of parameters formula we have
                                              2
                                                       Z t
                                                             c2
                                           − cb t
                                  u(t) = e        u0 +     e− b (t−σ) z(σ)dσ
                                                       0

                                                     11
and since ∆u0 ∈ L2 (Ω) (Φ0 ∈ H1 ), it suﬃces to verify that
                              Z t
                                      c2
                                   e− b (t−σ) ∆z(σ)dσ ∈ L2 (Ω), ∀t ⩾ 0.
                                    0

To this end we recall that (z, zt ) ∈ C([0, T ); H 1(Ω) × L2 (Ω)). Writing the linear solution of (1.1) (with
k = 0) in the z–variable yields
                  Z t                            Z

where the conclusion follows from the fact that the initial conditions for u satisfy the absorbing bound-
ary conditions and the variable z satisﬁes the absorbing boundary conditions along the trajectory.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.


4    Exponential decays – Proof of Theorem 2.2

In this section we work with the linearized version of (1.1) – i.e., we take k = 0 – in the z–variable.
Moreover, since τ is ﬁxed, we lose no generality by setting τ = 1, therefore this is assumed for the
                                                                  2
rest of the paper. Recall that the change of variables z = ut + cb u transforms (1.2) into

                                  ztt + bA(zt + N(κ1 N ∗ Az)) = −γutt + f.                                 (4.1)

We assume smooth initial conditions and a u–independent forcing term f ∈ C 1 (R+ , L2 (Ω)). This
ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions which are, in addition, continuously de-
pendent on the initial data. We can eventually extend the results that follow to semigroup solutions
by the virtue of density.

   The energy for a solution Φ = (u, ut, utt ) ∈ D(A) will be computed in two levels. We deﬁne the
lower energy functional E(t) = E0 (t) + E1 (t) where

                                           2              2
and the higher energy functional E(t) = E(t) + E2 (t) where

                                                       b

where α and γ may depend on x. We also note that

                                    kA1/2 uk22 = k∇uk22 + k κ0 uk2Γ0

. By Poincare- Wirtenberg inequality we obtain that

                                             kA1/2 uk2 ∼ kukH 1 (Ω)

    It is standard to see that E(t) ∼ kΦ(t)k2H , see [5] for details. The following lemma follows from
classic elliptic theory and provides the estimate which is necessary for justifying our choice of higher
energy functional. As a remark, here and hereafter we use the notation a . b to say that a ⩽ Cb
where C is a constant possibly depending on the physical parameters of the model (τ, c, b > 0) but
independent of space, time and γ ∈ L∞ (Ω).

Lemma 4.1. Let Ω be a smooth domain and consider a function u : Ω → R such that ∆u ∈ L2 (Ω)
and ∂ν u|∂Ω ∈ H 1/2 (Γ), then u ∈ H 2 (Ω) and

4.1     Propagation of boundary dissipation – Flow multipliers
We begin with energy identity for E1 . Since the problem is linear we work with smooth solutions (in
the domain of the generator) which can be extended by density to the phase space solutions.

Proposition 4.2 (Energy Identity). Let T > 0. If Ψ = (u, z, zt ) is a weak solution of (4.1) then

holds for 0 ≤ t ≤ T , where DΨ represents the interior/boundary damping and is given by

which is continuous. Moreover, recalling that Ψ = (u, z, zt ) it follows that 2E1 (t) = hΨ(t), Ψ(t)i.
Therefore, with G = (0, 0, f )⊤ we have, after straightforward calculations (see [6] for details)

Identity (4.5) then follows by an integration in time on [t, T ].

    In the next step we reconstruct the integral of the full energy on a truncated time interval (s, T −s)
for 0 < s < T /2.

holds for 0 < s < T /2. Here, lotδ (z) is a collection of lower order terms satisfying

for some δ > 0.

Proof. We study stability properties of both S(t) and T (t) assuming the general degenerated case
for γ, i.e., γ ∈ L∞ (Ω) and γ(x) ⩾ 0 a.e. in Ω. This includes a completely degenerate (critical) case
when γ = 0 and the uncontrolled dynamics is unstable. With a feedback boundary control, we will
be able to show that the semigroups can be stabilized – but under additional geometric conditions
which however are stronger than the ones typically assumed in a boundary stabilization theory of
hyperbolic dynamics. It is clear that if Γ0 = ∅ then the entire boundary Γ is dissipated and therefore
stability results would hold true without any additional geometric restrictions. Assuming Γ0 6= ∅,
and Γ0 is star-shaped (standard condition), classical stability methods (multipliers) do not work due
to conﬂicting signs of radial vector ﬁelds on the boundary Γ1 when acting on tangential derivatives.
This fact has been recognized already in [32]. However,due to convexity of Γ0 and Assumption 1 one
obtains the following construction [32]: there exists a vector ﬁeld h(x) = [h1 (x), · · · , hd (x)] ∈ C 2 (Ω)
such that
                                            h · ν = 0 on Γ0                                           (4.9a)

                                                          14
with ν being the unit outward normal, and that for some constant δ > 0 and all vector u(x) ∈
[L2 (Ω)]n , we have           Z                   Z
                                               J(h)|u(x)|2 dΩ ⩾ δ                 |u(x)|2dΩ,                    (4.9b)
                                           Ω                                  Ω

where J(h) represents the Jacobian matrix of h.
Remark 4.1. We note that the more general typical star–shaped condition h · ν ⩽ 0 on Γ0 is not
suﬃcient. This is due to the presence of tangential derivatives on uncontrolled part of the boundary
which can not be “absorbed” via dissipation by the microlocal argument [30, 43, 29].
   This all leads to the following local estimate

                                       k∂τ ukΣ0 ≤ CkutkΣ0 + Ck∂ν ukΣ0 + lotQ

valid on solutions. Above, lotQ mean lower order terms on Q = Ω × [0, T ]. By “bending” on the
boundary Γ0 the radial vector ﬁeld allows to eliminate its contribution of tangential derivatives. See
Remark 4.3.
Remark 4.2. Convexity of Γ0 is only one suﬃcient condition. Several examples where the construction
in (4.9) holds for other types of domains are given in [32].
    As mentioned earlier, since we have dissipation only on a portion of the boundary, while the
remaining part is subject to Neuman/Robin type of boundary conditions„ standard multiplier theory
with radial vector ﬁelds does no apply- due to sign inconsistency in the estimates of tangential
boundary integrals. The introduction of the vector ﬁeld h ∈ C 2 in (4.9) is then critical for the results
in this paper.
   We start with energetic calculations performed ﬁrst on regular (strong) solutions. Let’s multiply
equation (4.1) by h · ∇z integrate by parts in (s, T − s) × Ω, for s ∈ [0, T /2). This gives

   Now, the second part of geometrical condition (4.9) allow us to obtain an estimate for the potential
z–energy. To see this, ﬁrst notice that Mh (z) is controlled by the potential energy, indeed,

due to Robin boundary condition imposed on Γ0 which allows to control L2 norms by the gradient.
Moreover, the last term in (4.13) can be estimated as
               Z T −sZ                        Z T −sZ

and ﬁnally

Therefore, combining (4.15), (4.16), (4.17) and the second part of assumption (4.9) we obtain, for

   Now, given the deﬁnition of E1 , we need an estimate for the kinetic energy in order to continue.
For that, we multiply (4.1) by z and again integrate by parts over (s, T − s) × Ω to obtain

Identity (4.19) implies the following upper estimate for the kinetic energy

and then combining (4.18) and (4.20) [adding and subtracting the boundary term deﬁning kA1/2 zk2
from the gradient], and noticing that the term kγ 1/2 ut k in E1 (t) can be obtained by the ﬁrst two, we
conclude

    We notice that for all the computations carried out so far we only needed the second part of
our geometric assumption, that is, it would work with any C 2 –vector ﬁeld such that its Jacobian is
strictly positive. Only now, in the analysis of the boundary term B̃(Γ) will we use assumption (4.9a)
to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 4.4 (Key Lemmma). The boundary term B̃(Γ) satisfies the following estimate

where lotδ (z) has the properties stated in Proposition (4.3).

                                                                       17
Proof. We need to estimate all the terms in (4.22). We immediately notice that the ﬁrst boundary
term contains |zt |2 − |∇τ z|2 evaluated on the boundary. However, on Γ0 we have no information on
either tangential derivative – which provides contribution unbounded with respect to the energy level.
And it is at this point where we will be using orthogonality of the constructed vector ﬁeld h with
respect to normal to the boundary direction. The details are given below.
    We start with the last term in (4.22) . Notice that

where ∂τ indicates derivative in the tangential direction, poses diﬃculties. Boundary condition on Γ0
provide good estimate for the ﬁrst part. However, for the second no estimate is available unless zt |Γ0
is under control, which is given through the dissipation or h · ν = 0.
   Back to (4.25), for Γ1 a tangential–trace estimate is available. In fact, using an adaptation
of Lemma 2.1 in [28], which was obtained via microlocal analysis of the homogeneous case, and
accounting for our non–homogeneity −γutt + f in (4.1) we obtain

with lotδ (z) complying with the condition stated in Proposition 4.3. With this we then improve

due to (4.26). Finally, we tackle the more involved term. We notice that,
                  Z T −s Z                   Z T −s Z                          

                                                  s           Γ

where we have used the fact that the second integral in (4.28) is exactly the one in (4.24) up to an
uniformly bounded term. For the ﬁrst integral in (4.28), we use the identity

                               ∂ν (h · ∇z) = |∂ν z|2 (h · ν) + ∂ν z∂τ z(h · τ )

which is obtained by writing the coordinates of the vector ∇z in the basis {τ, ν}. This allows us to
write, recalling the damping terms (4.6) and the tangential trace inequality (4.26):
                  Z T −sZ                       Z T −sZ
                           ∂ν z (h · ∇z) dΓdt .            ∂ν z∂τ z(h · τ )

                                                          0

and we now invoke Sobolev Embedding’s Theory. Recall that

                                 λ∂ν z = −κ0 z ∈ H 3/2 (Γ0 ) ֒→ H δ1 (Γ0 )

(δ1 ⩽ 3/2) since z ∈ H 2 (Ω) if Ψ is a classic solution. On the other hand,

                                       ∂τ z ∈ H 1/2 (Γ0 ) ֒→ H δ2 (Γ0 )

(δ2 ⩽ 1/2). Taking any δ1 = δ ∈ (0, 1/2] and δ2 = −δ1 ∈ [−1/2, 0) we have, by duality pairing along
with continuity of the operator ∂τ |Γ0 : H 3/2−δ (Ω) → H −δ (Γ0 )

ﬁnishing the proof of Lemma 4.4.

                                                          19
   Finally, Lemma 4.4 yields Proposition 4.3 after taking ε small enough.

   Our next result aims at improving Lemma 4.3 by absorbing lotδ (z) by the damping. For the linear
problem the compactness uniqueness argument used for achieving it is stated below.

Proposition 4.5. For T > 0 there exists a constant CT > 0 such that the following inequality holds:
                                                 Z T
                                   lotδ (z) ≤ CT     DΨ (s)ds                                (4.32)
                                                                 0

Proof. As pointed out in the statement of Proposition (4.3), we have
                                             n                               o
                            lotδ (z) ≤ Cδ sup kzk2H 1−δ (Ω) + kzt k2H −δ (Ω)
                                                 t∈[0,T ]

for δ ∈ (0, 1/2). Then we prove Proposition (4.5) as a corollary of the following Lemma
Lemma 4.6. There exists a constant CT such that
                                                                              Z T
                               k(z, zt )k2L2 (0,T ;H 1−δ (Ω)×H −δ (Ω)) ⩽ CT         DΨ (s)ds                  (4.33)
                                                                               0

Proof. The proof is based on compactness-uniqueness argument. Compactness follows from compact-
ness of Sobolev’s embeddings implicated in the deﬁnition of of lower order terms with respect to
the ﬁnite energy space for variables (z, zt ) which are H 1 (Ω) × L2 (Ω). Uniqueness, instead follows
from the overdetermination of the wawe equation with overdetermined Neuman-Dirichlet data on the
boundary Γ1 . Using the notation of [41], let X = H 1 (Ω), B = H 1−δ (Ω) and Y = H −δ (Ω). Then it
follows from [35, Theorem 16.1] that the injection of X in B is compact. Moreover, since δ ∈ (0, 1/2),
[35, Theorem 12.4] allows us to write

                                        Y = H −δ (Ω) = [L2 (Ω), H −1 (Ω)]δ ,

and then the injection of B in Y is continuous (even dense). Introduce the space Λ as

                                    Λ ≡ {v ∈ L2 (0, T ; X); v̇ ∈ L2 (0, T ; Y )}

equipped with the norm
                                       kvkΛ = kvkL2 (0,T ;X) + kv̇kL2 (0,T ;Y ) .
Then it follows from [41] that the injection of W into L2 (0, T ; B) is compact. We are then ready for
proving (4.33)

   From idenity (4.5) (with f = 0) we see that the uniform boundedness E1n (0) implies uniform
boundedness of E1n (t), t ∈ [0, T ]. Therefore, one might choose a (non–relabeled) subsequence satisfying

                                             zn → some ζ, weak∗ in L∞ (0, T ; H 1(Ω))                (4.35a)

                               k(zn , żn )kL∞ (0,T ;H 1 (Ω)×H −δ (Ω)) = kzn kΛ ⩽ M,                  (4.37)

for all n. Then, by compactness (of Λ in L2 (0, T ; H 1−δ (Ω)) there exists a subsequence, still indexed
by n, such that
                              zn → ζ strongly in L2 (0, T ; H 1−δ (Ω)).                            (4.38)
    Next we show that η and ζ are zero elements. Indeed, from (4.34b) we obtain that γ 1/2 ün → 0 in
L2 (0, T ; L2(Ω)) and żn |Γ1 → 0 in L2 (0, T ; L2(Γ1 )). This implies that η̇ = 0 and ζ̇|Γ1 = 0. Indeed, the
last claim follows from γ 1/2 ün → η̇ in H −1(0, T ; L2 (Ω) where by the uniqueness of the limit one must
have η̇ ≡ 0 . Similar argument applies to infer ζ̇|Γ1 = 0.
    Next, passing to the limit as n → ∞ yields the following over determined (on Γ1 ) problem:

plus respective initial data. The overdetermined ζ–problem implies in particular with v ≡ ζt

which yields overdetermination of boundary data on Γ1 for the wave operator. Here we have used
contradiction assumption (4.34b). This gives v ≡ 0, hence ζt ≡ 0 and ζtt = 0 distributionally . Using
this information in (4.36a) yields
                                                                 

Standard elliptic estimate, along with κ0 > 0 gives ζ ≡ 0 in Q.
    Finally, weak∗ convergence of żn in L∞ (0, T ; L2 (Ω)) and the compacity of L2 (Ω) into H −δ (Ω) (see
[35, Theorem 16.1 with s = 0 and ε = δ]) we have żn (t) → ζ̇(t) strongly in H −δ (Ω) for a.e. t ∈ [0, T ]
and this allow us to compute (due to Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem):
                                         Z T                              Z T
    lim kżn k2L2 (0,T ;H −δ (Ω) = lim         kżn (t)k2H −δ (Ω) dt =          lim kżn (t)k2H −δ (Ω) dt = kζ̇k2L2 (0,T ;H −δ (Ω) = 0
   n→∞                             n→∞    0                                0    n→∞


since ζ̇ ≡ 0 in Q. Then, passing with the limit as n → ∞ in (4.34a) we have

                                                   0 = kζkL2 (0,T ;H 1−δ (Ω)) = 1,

which is a contradiction. The Lemma is proved.

   Lemma 4.6 implies in a straightforward way the result of the proposition 4.5.

   We are ready to establish the exponential decay of the the energy functional E1 .

Theorem 4.7. Assume that f = 0. Hence, the energy functional E1 is exponentially stable, i.e. there
exists T > 0 and constants M, ω > 0 such that

                                              E1 (t) ≤ Me−ωt E1 (0),            for t ⩾ 0.                                        (4.40)

Proof. For f = 0, identity (4.5) implies
                                   Z s                   Z T 
                                                      +             E1 (t)dt ≤ 2sE1 (0).
                                                  0        T −s

Since s < T /2 can be taken arbitrarily small, we ﬁx s < 1/2 in the above inequality. Then by
dissipativity of E1 (for f = 0) along with Propositions 4.3 and 4.5 we infer
                                         Z T                                    Z T
                                               E1 (t)dt . E1 (T ) + CT                DΨ (s)ds.                                   (4.41)
                                          0                                      0

On the other hand, using identity (4.5) (with f = 0) once more, we deduce
                                                       Z T                      Z T
                                     T E1 (T ) .              E1 (t)dt + CT           DΨ (s)ds.                                   (4.42)
                                                          0                       0

Combining (4.41) and (4.42) we arrive at
                                                              Z T                     Z T
                                 (T − C)E1 (T ) +                   E1 (t)dt ≤ CT           DΨ (s)ds
                                                               0                       0

                                                                     22
for some C > 0. Choosing T = 2C and replacing the “damping” term using identity (4.5) (with
f = 0) we rewrite the above estimate as follows
                                                Z T
                                  E1 (T ) +           E1 (t)dt . CT [E1 (0) − E1 (T )]
                                                 0

which implies
                                                             CT
                                            E1 (T ) ⩽             E1 (0) = µE1 (0),
                                                           1 + CT
where 0 < µ < 1 does not depend on the solution. This implies (4.40) with ω = | ln µ|/T and
M = 1/µ.

   The result of Theorem 4.7 is the key to establish the exponential stability of of the semigroup
S(t), generated by A on H.


4.2     Proof of Theorem 2.2
Part (i). Notice that the exponential decay for E1 obtained in Theorem (4.7) implies exponential
decay of the quantities kzkD(A1/2 ) , kzt kL2 (Ω) , and we will show that this implies exponential decay for
the total energy E(t), provided that the initial data u0 is controlled with respecyt to the topology
induced by A1/2 . For this, the only remaining quantity we need to show exponential decay is kukD(A1/2)
and this follows from the fact that but + c2 u = z. Indeed, the variation of parameters formula implies
that                                                    Z             t
                                                      c2                     c2
                                      u(t) = e− b t u0 +                  e− b (t−τ ) z(τ )dτ,             (4.43)
                                                                  0

then, computing the D(A1/2 )–norm both sides we estimate
                                        2
                                                            Z t
                                                                  c2
                                     − cb t
                   ku(t)kD(A1/2 ) ⩽ e       ku0 kD(A1/2 ) +     e− b (t−τ ) kz(τ )kD(A1/2 ) dτ             (4.44)
                                                                             0

hence it follows from (4.40) that

                                                                                 Z t

    The proof is complete.

Part (ii). The ﬁrst step towards showing H1 –level stabilization is to derive energy estimate for the
higher order energy functional E2 . We start with a basic multiplier identity.

   We now derive the estimate for E2 . We take the L2 –inner product of

   Now since all terms in (4.46) are benign in the sense that all (but f and ∆u) are either members
of E(t) or are bounded above by the damping, it follows that for each ε > 0 there exists Cε > 0 such
that

    Then, taking ε small and using (4.40) we have

    From (4.48) we have obtained that ∆u(t) ∈ L2 (Ω). In addition (u, ut, utt ) ∈ H implies that u(t) ∈
H 1 (Ω) and ut (t) ∈ H 1 (Ω). By a standard duality argument one this obtains that ∂ν u(t) ∈ H −1/2 (Γ).
We will be able to improve this regularity by appealing to H regularity already obtained in te previous
section. On the other hand, by using invariance of boundary conditions we also have

                  ∂ν u(t)|Γ0 = −κ0 u(t) ∈ H 1/2 (Γ0 )        ∂ν u(t)|Γ1 = −κ1 ut (t) ∈ H 1/2 (Γ1 ).

By the deﬁnition of the norm in H1 the above implies that (u, ut, utt ) ∈ H1 , as desired. Moreover we
have a control of the norms:
                                                              √                     √
         k(u, ut, utt )kH1 ⩽ C||(u, ut, utt )kH + k∆u(t)k2 + k κ0 u(t)kH 1/2 (Γ0 + k κ1 ut (t)|H 1/2 (Γ1 )
                          ⩽ C (k(u, ut, utt )kH + k∆u(t)k2 )

which proved the desired regularity in H1 . We are ready to complete the proof.

for all t ⩾ 0, for some ω, M > 0. By making T → ∞ we see that
                                        Z ∞
                                            E(σ)dσ < +∞,
                                                    0

and the result follows by Pazy–Datko’s Theorem [37].

H1 . To this end, ﬁx r > 0 such that kΦ0 kH1 ⩽ r and let X be the set deﬁned as

where β > 0 is for the time being a given positive number but we will take it to be suﬃciently
small later. Moreover, the condition sup kΨ(t)kH1 . r + 1 simply means that solutions will exist in
                                         t∈[0,T ]
bounded sets of C([0, T ]; H1 ) with respect to H but this introduces no restriction on the size of the

We start with a regularity lemma.

Lemma 5.1. For Ψ = (w, wt , wtt )⊤ let the action F on Ψ be given by
                                                             
                                                        0
                                               1             
                                      F (Ψ) =          0     .                                                                 (5.1)

                                                   wt2 + wwtt

Then the following assertions hold true:

 (i) F defines a continuous map F : X β → C([0, T ]; H1 ) and, in particular, for each t the inequality

                                                                   Cβ
                                           kF (Ψ(t))kH1 ⩽             kΨ(t)kH1 ,                    Ψ ∈ Xβ                       (5.2)
                                                                    τ
      holds for some C > 0 fixed.

 (ii) Stronger than continuity, the following estimate holds:
                                                                                √

Proof. Recall that wt ∈ HΓ11 (Ω) ֒→ L4 (Ω) and then wt2 ∈ C([0, T ]; L2(Ω)). Moreover, since H 2 (Ω) ֒→
L∞ (Ω) it follows that wwtt ∈ C([0, T ]; L2 (Ω)). For each t, interpolation inequalities23 give

                           τ kF (Φ)(t)kH1 = kwt2 + wwtt k2 . kwt k24 + kwk∞ kwtt k2
                                                                   2                        1/2      1/2

which yields (5.2) and, by taking the supremum on both sides, also (i) altogether. Moreover, returning
to the intermediate estimate (5.4), we further notice

and S(t) on H1 and H respectively, guarantees that, for each Ψ ∈ X there exists a unique Φ =
(u, ut, utt )⊤ =: Θ(Ψ) ∈ C([0, T ]; H1 ) solution of (2.9) characterized as the variation of parameters
formula with forcing term F (Ψ) and initial condition Φ0 = (u0 , u1 , u2 ) ∈ H1 , i.e.,
                                                     Z t
                             Θ(Ψ)(t) = T (t)Φ0 +         T (t − σ)F (Ψ)(σ)dσ                      (5.5)
                                                     0

and we note that the same formula is valid if we replace T (t) by S(t). Moreover, uniform exponential
stability implies the existence of numbers ω0 , ω1 , M0 , M1 > 0 such that

                    kT (t)Φ0 kH1 ⩽ M1 e−ω1 t kΦ0 kH1 and kT (t)Φ0 kH ⩽ M0 e−ω0 t kΦ0 kH             (5.6)

for all t ⩾ 0. Among other properties, the exponential stability of the linear problem implies invariance
of the map Θ in X β , as we make precise below.

Lemma 5.2. . Given Φ0 ∈ H1 such that kΦ0 kH1 ≤ C . Then, there exist β > 0 and ρβ > 0 with the
property that if kΦ0 kH < ρβ then the map Θ is X β –invariant.

Proof. Proving this claim is equivalent to prove that there exists β > 0 for which kΘ(Ψ)(t)kH1 . r + 1
and kΘ(Ψ)(t)kH < β for all t ∈ [0, T ) and each Ψ ∈ X β , provided kΦ0 kH < ρβ , with ρβ conveniently
chosen. From (5.5) and (5.6) it follows, for each t ∈ [0, T ),

   We are then ready to prove that for a (possibly smaller) β, the map Θ is a contraction.


                                                    27
Lemma 5.3. There exist β > 0 and ρβ > 0 with the property that if kΦ0 kH < ρβ then Θ is a
contraction.

Proof. Let Ψ1 , Ψ2 ∈ X β , Ψ1 = (v, vt , vtt )⊤ and Ψ2 = (w, wt , wtt )⊤ . The key point of this proof is to
estimate kF (Ψ1 ) − F (Ψ2 )kC([0,T ];H1) , which is where we start. First notice that, since the ﬁrst two
coordinates of both F (Ψ1 ) and F (Ψ2 ) are zero, we just care about the third one, whose diﬀerence,
for each t, is given by

                   vt2 + vvtt − wt2 − wwtt = (vt + wt )(vt − wt ) + (v − w)vtt + w(vtt − wtt )
                                             |       {z        } | {z } |             {z    }
                                                                      =I1 (t)           =I2 (t)   =I3 (t)

                                                          = I1 (t) + I2 (t) + I3 (t).                        (5.9)

Now we estimate the supremmum of the L2 -norm of I1 . For this we notice that a combination of
Holder’s Inequality with the Sobolev Embedding HΓ21 (Ω) ֒→ L4 (Ω) yields

                       kI1 (t)k2 = k(vt + wt )(vt − wt )k2 ⩽ (kvt k4 + kwt k4 ) kvt − wt k4
                                     . (k∇vt k2 + k∇wt k2 ) k∇(vt − wt )k2 . βkΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β ,

for each t. Then sup kI1 (t)k2 ⩽ βkΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β . Next, for estimating the suppremum of the L2 –norm
                   t∈[0,T ]
of I2 we notice that the sobolev embedding HΓ21 (Γ) ֒→ L∞ (Ω) yields

                                    kI2 (t)k2 = kvtt (v − w)k2 ⩽ kvtt k2 kv − wk∞
                                                   . kvtt k2 k∆(v − w)k2 . βkΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β ,

for each t ∈ [0, T ). Then sup kI2 (t)k2 ⩽ βkΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β . Finally, for estimating the supremum of the
                                 t∈[0,T ]
L –norm of I3 we will use the (further to the Sobolev emdedding HΓ21 (Ω) ֒→ L∞ (Ω)) the interpolation
 2
                         1/2      1/2
inequality kwk∞ . k∇wk2 k∆wk2 which holds for all w ∈ HΓ21 (Ω). We have

                kI3 (t)k2 = kw(vtt − wtt )k2 ⩽ kwk∞ kvtt − wtt k2
                                            1/2           1/2
                              . k∇wk2 k∆wk2 kvtt − wtt k2
                                     r                                    √
                              . β 1/2 sup kΨ2 (t)kH1 kΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β . β 1/2 r + 1kΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β ,
                                            t∈[0,T ]
                                                √
for each t ∈ [0, T ). Then sup kI3 (t)k2 . β 1/2 r + 1kΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β .
                                 t∈[0,T ]

     Therefore, the proof for contractivity goes as follows:
                                              Z t
               kΘ(Ψ1 ) − Θ(Ψ2 )kX β = sup         T (t − σ) [F (Ψ1 ) − F (Ψ2 )] dσ
                                                       t∈[0,T ]   0                               H1
                                                    C ω1
                                                  ⩽      sup τ kF (Ψ1 )(t) − F (Ψ)(t)kH1
                                                     τ t∈[0,T ]
                                                  . sup (kI1 (t)k2 + kI2 (t)k2 + kI3 (t)k2 )
                                                   t∈[0,T ]
                                                             √       
                                                  . 2β + β 1/2 r + 1 kΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β = Cβ kΨ1 − Ψ2 kX β       (5.10)

owning the property Cβ < 1 to the smallness of β.

                                                                         28
     Notice that exponential stability of the linear problem in H and H1 allows we to obtain the
estimates (5.7), (5.8) and (5.10) with right hand side time–independent. This allows us to take
T = ∞ is all of them and repeat the same construction to obtain a ﬁxed–point of Θ deﬁned in the
whole R+ .
    This completes the proof of theorem 2.3 by taking ρ = ρβ .


6      Proof of Theorem 2.4-Uniform Nonlinear Stability

In this section we show that one can easily show that the solution of the nonlinear problem decay
exponentially to zero as t → ∞ by taking advantage of three facts established in this paper.

    (i) The fact that the solution is a ﬁxed point of the map Θ deﬁned in (5.5), and therefore can be
        implicitly represented as
                                                     Z t
                                    Φ(t) = T (t)Φ0 +     T (t − σ)F (Φ)(σ)dσ                     (6.1)
                                                               0


 (ii) The fact that our existence of global solution result requires smallness of initial data only in the
      a lower topology and the use of this along with interpolation inequalities allowed us to obtain
      the key estimate (5.2).

 (ii) The fact that the semigroup T (t) in (6.1) is uniformly exponentially stable in both H and H1 .

     The ﬁnal result of this section is the following.

Theorem 6.1. There exists ρ > 0 such that the solution Φ constructed in (2.3) is such that
                                                                       ω1
                                       kΦ(t)kH1 ⩽ 2M1 e− 2 t kΦ0 kH1                                 (6.2)

for all t ⩾ 0, where M1 , ω1 are the constants involved in the uniform stability of the linear semigroup
T (t).

    The proof of this result relies heavily on the facts (i)–(ii) outlined above and a Grownwall type
inequality. This inequality seems to have been originally introduced in [1], but here we are using [2,
Corollary 1, p. 389]. We state the inequality here for convenience, but in a version which is suitable
for our use in what follows. We invite the reader to consult [1, 2] and references therein for more
details

Lemma 6.2 (Grownwall–Beesack Inequality). Let u, f, g, h : R → R measurable functions such that
f h, gh and uh are integrable. If u, f, g, h are nonnegative and

Proof of Theorem 6.1. We use the same constants as in (5.6), that is, we use that

                                            kT (t)kL(H1 ) ⩽ M1 e−ω1 t                                     (6.5)

for all t. Moreover, we know that the solution Φ exists in some X β for β > 0 small and that the
whole argument of the proof for the existence of global solution would still be true if one decreased
β. Therefore, by possibly taking it smaller, we assume
                                                                τ ω1

where ω1 = ω1 (τ ) is the rate of exponential decay of the semigroup T (t) in H1 for a ﬁxed τ > 0. As
in the proof of global wellposedness, we take ρ = ρβ . We then compute, via (6.5) and (5.2)
                                                 Z t
                     kΦ(t)kH1 ⩽ kT (t)Φ0 kH1 +       kT (t − σ)F (Φ)(σ)kH1 dσ

Corollary 6.3. With reference to Section 5, let β0 be the largest number such that the map Θ has
a fixed point in X β0 which is, moreover, uniformly exponentially stable as in Theorem 2.4. Let
ω : (0, β0 ] → R+ be the function that maps each β > 0 to the decay rate ω(β). Then there exists
another function ω : (0, β0] → R+ such that ω(β) ⩾ ω(β) for all feasible β and

                                                 lim ω(β) = ω1 ,                                          (6.8)
                                                β→0

where ω1 is the decay rate of the linear semigroup T (t).

                                                        30
Proof of Corollary 6.3. The proof of Theorem 2.4 already provides a proof of Corollary 6.3. In-
deed, it suﬃces to deﬁne ω : (0, β0 ] → R+ by
                                                     M1 Cβ
                                       ω(β) = ω1 −         > 0.
