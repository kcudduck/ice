= The acoustic bubble is an example of a highly nonlinear system which is the building block
op. of several applications and phenomena ranging from underwater acoustics to sonochemistry and
medicine. Nonlinear behavior of bubbles, and most importantly : order subharmonics (SH), are
@)\ used to increase the contrast to tissue ratio (CTR) in diagnostic ultrasound (US) and to monitor
bubble mediated therapeutic US. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when bubbles are
f=) sonicated with their SH resonance frequency (fsn = 2f, where f; is the linear resonance frequency),
oN SHs are generated at the lowest excitation pressure. SHs then increase rapidly with pressure increase
®' and reach an upper limit of the achievable SH signal strength. Numerous studies have investigated
] the pressure threshold of SH oscillations; however, conditions to enhance the saturation level of
- SHs has not been investigated. In this paper nonlinear dynamics of bubbles excited by frequencies
Co in the range of f, < f < 2f, is studied for different sizes of bubbles (400nm-8 pum). We show
oS that the SH resonance frequency is pressure dependent and decreases as pressure increases. When
¢) a bubble is sonicated with its pressure dependent SH resonance frequency, oscillations undergo a
* v= saddle node bifurcation from a P1 or P2 regime to a P2 oscillation regime with higher amplitude.
2 The saddle node bifurcation is concomitant with over saturation of the SH and UH amplitude and
le eventual enhancement of the upper limit of SH and UH strength (e.g. ~ 7 dB in UH amplitude).
ay This can increase the CTR and signal to noise ratio in applications. Here, we show that the highest
hed non-destructive SH amplitude occurs when f = 1.5 — 1.8f,
