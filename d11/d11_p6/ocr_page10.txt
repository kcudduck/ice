8, the cavitation onset for a given frequency could depend on the amplitude if the diameter
of the probe is relatively small. For very high frequencies and diameters the cavitation onset
happens at constant values of amplitude, therefore in that condition and only in that
conditions the power radiated per unit of area is a good parameter to control the cavitation
occurrence. However, in many normal conditions with frequencies of 20 to 30 KHz and
diameters smaller than 80 and 50mm respectively, cavitation onset would happen at
different values of amplitude and therefore with different powers per unit of area. For
example at 20 KHz and with diameter 40 mm the amplitude needed for cavitation onset is
approximately 0.3 um, with a 20 mm diameter, the amplitude changes to approximately 0.6
um (Figure 4). Therefore the power radiated per unit of area approximately doubles.
In order to increase the reproducibility when the sonication is close to the cavitation
threshold the use of the power irradiated is not suitable for many common probes and
frequencies. The dimensionless number G4 represents a better option in these cases.
6. Conclusions.
A dimensionless number that predicts cavitation in accelerated systems has been used to
predict ultrasonic cavitation.
The dimensionless number is
P — Py
Gp = —— 7

A= aL (7)
where G, is the dimensionless number, p is the pressure of the liquid at the depth of the
probe tip, p, is the vapour pressure of the liquid, p is the density of the liquid, L is the
shortest between the radius of the probe and half the wavelength, and a is the acceleration
of the tip.
For values of G4 < 1 cavitation is expected; and for values of G, >> 1 cavitation is not
expected.
The power irradiated per unit of area is not a good parameter to predict cavitation onset in
many common applications, i.e. low ultrasonic frequency and medium diameters. G4
represents a better parameter to predict cavitation and to increase reproducibility when the
conditions are close to the cavitation threshold.
