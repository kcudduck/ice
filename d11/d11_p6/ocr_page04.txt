the traditional one is meaningless in ultrasonic cavitation as shown below. It is given by the
equation:
P— Pv

Neca = 17 po (3)
where N., is the traditional cavitation number, p is the pressure of the undisturbed liquid,
p,, is the vapour pressure of the liquid, p is the density of the liquid and v is the velocity of
the liquid, for the ultrasonic case, we take the value of the speed of the ultrasonic probe tip
since the rest of the fluid is still.
Let’s assume a condition where it is known that cavitation happens, for example an
ultrasonic probe of 15.9mm diameter oscillating at 20 KHz with an amplitude of 5 um in
water at room conditions. For this situation N-, = 495 that is much greater than 1 and
suggest that there is no cavitation demonstrating that N., is meaningless for ultrasonic
cavitation as it was already known. Conversely G4, = 0.156 that is much smaller than 1 and
indicates that there is cavitation as it is the case. Other comparisons between N-, and G4
can be found in (13).

3. Simulation set up.
Many commercial ultrasonic probes produce cavitation in all working conditions, even when
there are means of reducing the power. Therefore, in order to investigate the validity of G4,
a simulation of the ultrasonic probe for multiple diameters, amplitudes and frequencies is
chosen.
The simulation is made with FEM by coupling compressible laminar flow with acoustics using
a moving mesh. The geometry is a cylindrical probe placed in the centre of a cylindrical
beaker. The beaker has a flat bottom with an acoustic impedance of 12.3-10° Pa-s/m. The
speed of sound in water is taken as 1481 m/s. The tensile strength of water is assumed to be
null, thus there are enough nuclei within the liquid that create the conditions for cavitation
when parts of the liquid go into negative absolute pressure. This reasoning is also
embedded in the formulation of the traditional cavitation number.
The simulation time was long enough to allow the pressure wave to be reflected on the wall
of the beaker and come back to the probe tip. At 20Khz this is achieved easily since the
period is almost as long as the time of flight of the sound wave. In Figure 2 the wave
generated by an ultrasonic probe at 20 Khz is shown during the first cycle just before
arriving to the bottom of the beaker. The wave is almost spherical. It losses intensity the
longer it travels. Therefore, the influence of the reflected wave on the minimum pressure is
limited. Conversely, at higher frequencies, for example at 1 MHz, the wavelength is much
smaller than the diameter of the probe. Consequently, the wave is almost longitudinal, its
intensity does not decrease so much and the influence of the reflection at the bottom of the
