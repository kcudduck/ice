In the deflection, or change from tilted to horizontal, of the contourline shown in the charts
there is a small departure from G, = 1 of the simulations. This is easy to observe in Figure 6
(40KHz) and Figure 7 (100 KHz) where the only two squares that are not actually touching
G4, = 1 are in this region, above the line G4, = 1. The meaning of this is that at these
diameters it is slightly more difficult to get cavitation and the amplitude has to be slightly
bigger. This behaviour is attributed to the propagation of waves from the border of the
probe. This waves are clearly visible in Figure 3 although for a case with higher frequency.
The centre of these toroidal waves are the two lower corners, left and right, of the probe.
Since Figure 3 depicts a cross section of the probe, these waves have a circular shape with
centre on the left and right lower corners of the probe. These waves seem to couple with
the main waves and reduce the pressure oscillations for these diameters where the
wavelength is similar to the diameter size.
In general, the contourline G4, = 1 defines with high degree of accuracy the threshold for
cavitation. Given a frequency, the threshold is dependent on the amplitude for small
diameters, however the threshold is not dependent on the amplitude for relatively big
diameters. A further investigation of this phenomena using a simple calculation of the
radiated power in each case is developed.
The power radiated per unit of area is a parameter often used in ultrasonic cavitation to
quantify the intensity of cavitation. Using a simple model to calculate power

P=F-v (4)
where P is the power, F is the force and v is the velocity. Applying this model to a small
area in front of the probe tip we can have

P

— =p, V (5)

A Po
where first term is the power radiated per unit of area, p, is the gauge pressure and v is
the velocity of the probe tip. As the gauge pressure is constant and equal to p — p,, for the
condition of cavitation onset, it is concluded that the power radiated per unit of area is
proportional to the tip velocity for the condition of cavitation onset.
The maximum tip velocity is given by the equation

v=d2mrf) (6)
therefore the tip velocity is proportional to the amplitude d for a given frequency f.
The consequence of equations 5 and 6 is that the power radiated per unit of area for the
condition of cavitation onset is proportional to the amplitude. As it is shown in figures 4 to
