4. Results.
The results are presented in charts amplitude versus diameter. See Figures 4-8. For each
probe diameter, there is an amplitude limit above which cavitation exists. Conversely for
smaller amplitudes cavitation does not occur. It is easy to conclude that the region of the
chart with high amplitude corresponds to the region where cavitation happens while the
region with low amplitudes cavitation does not happen. The shape of the transition
between this two regions and the location of such transition is calculated with the finite
element method and represented by square dots in the chart. At the same time the
