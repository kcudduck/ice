Ultrasonic cavitation is widely used for homogenization, dispersion, deagglomeration,
erosion, cleaning, milling, emulsification, extraction, disintegration and sonochemistry.
Different processes require different intensities of cavitation. The way to control the
intensity is typically with the power output and frequency of the ultrasonic probe. However,
the power output has limitations to indicate the existence of cavitation. If the pressures
created by the sound wave are not enough to reduce the local pressure below the vapour
pressure, the sound wave could be transmitted to the liquid without generation of
cavitation.
There is a wide range of sonication intensities that are commonly used. This range goes
from high intensity cavitation to ultrasound without cavitation. The absence of cavitation
during sonication was proven useful in some chemical reactions (2) and in increasing the
temperature of the nucleation of ice in water (3). Low acoustic intensity can enhance
bacteriological processes (4, 5). This is especially important in sonobioreactors, where
excessive cavitation can damage the cell culture, although ultrasound produces beneficial
effects (6). On the other hand, there are applications where ultrasound is used but
cavitation is not desirable such as medicine or ultrasound diagnosis (7)
Sonochemistry has been proven to have in many occasions low reproducibility due to
geometrical differences of the beaker or reactor, and power and frequency dependence on
the probe itself (8). On the other hand, in biology, the failure to reproduce the results from
another investigator during sonication of cells in vitro is common due to the variability in
the occurrence of cavitation (9). Mason and Peters listed a series of parameter that should
be reported in order to increase the poor reproducibility commonly found (10). Among
those parameters are frequency, intensity and shape. Researchers from the National
Physical Laboratory reported the creation of a reference cavitating vessel to increase
reproducibility in industrial and research applications (11, 12). Consequently, a
dimensionless number that quantifies the existence of cavitation could be a complementary
parameter that increases accuracy in the replication of conditions in research and industrial
applications, especially when the conditions are close to the cavitation threshold.
Therefore, a dimensionless number that predicts the existence or absence of cavitation and
the proximity to the threshold between the two conditions is a contribution with immediate
application that can increase reproducibility. This article provides this dimensionless number
applied to ultrasonic cavitation.
2. Dimensionless number.

In 2016 a new dimensionless number to predict cavitation in accelerated systems was
reported (13). It was applied to the “tube arrest” method and to the downstream flow of a
closing valve. The new dimensionless number was formulated as
