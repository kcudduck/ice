contourlines for G4 values of 0.5, 1 and 2 are included in these charts. G4 is calculated using
the radius of the probe for the left part of the charts. For the right end, where diameters of
the probe are big, and the radius of the probe is longer than half the wavelength, half the
wavelength is used. Half the wavelength is calculated as cAt where c is the speed of sound
and At is half the period. This explains why G4 is not dependent on the diameter of the
probe when the dimeter is large. It becomes a horizontal line on the right part of the chart.
The selection of frequencies used for this study are 20 KHz (Figure 4), 30 KHz (Figure 5), 40
KHz (Figure 6), 100 KHz (Figure 7) and 1 MHz (Figure 8). The higher the frequency is, the
shorter the wavelength is, and therefore, the longer the horizontal part of the countourline
for G4 is.
