Abstract
Ultrasonic cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities within a liquid due to the action of
an ultrasound source. It is widely used for homogenization, dispersion, deagglomeration,
erosion, cleaning, milling, emulsification, extraction, disintegration and sonochemistry. On
the other hand, the so-called cavitation number is used to assess the likelihood of cavitation
in fluid flows within a conduit or around a hydrofoil but it is not valid in ultrasonic cavitation
since there is no fluid flow. A recently formulated number predicts the cavitation in case of
sudden accelerations. The tip surface of an ultrasonic probe is subjected to a continuous
repetition of alternating accelerations at high frequency. Therefore, the use of the recently
formulated number in ultrasonic cavitation is explored here. Simulations of the ultrasonic
probe in water just at the condition of cavitation onset have been performed for a
combination of probe diameters from 0.2 to 100 mm and frequencies 20, 30, 40, 100 and
1000 KHz. The recently formulated number is applied to these combinations and it is found
that can be used to predict ultrasonic cavitation. Consequently, the dimensionless number
can be used to decide the conditions to avoid or generate cavitation when a fluid is
sonicated and to increase reproducibility in such conditions.

1. Introduction
Vaporous cavitation in a fluid is the change from liquid phase to vapour phase due to a drop
in the local pressure, as opposed to boiling where the change of phase is due to a rise in
temperature. As the change of pressure propagates much faster than the change of
temperature, the cavities can be generated and collapsed rapidly producing turbulence,
sound, pressure shockwaves, local rise of temperature and surface erosion. Thoma and
Leraux introduced in 1923-1925 a dimensionless number called cavitation number (1) that is
used in fluid flows, for example, to either prevent cavitation in a hydrofoil or in a conduit,
or to produce cavitation in laboratory tests. This number cannot be applied to ultrasonic
cavitation.
