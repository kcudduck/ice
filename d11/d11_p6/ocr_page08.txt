Figure 8 Amplitude needed to cavitate for a given probe diameter at 1
MHz in water at room conditions. Contourlines for (4, values of 0.5, 1
and 2 compare with the onset of cavitation according to simulations
represented as squares. Yellow squares indicate without reflection of
wave pressures.
5. Discussion.
Figure 4 shows the results for 20 KHz. The red squares represent the condition of amplitude
and probe diameter of the cavitation onset. At higher amplitudes the liquid would cavitate,
at lower amplitudes the liquid will not cavitate. The location of these squares coincide
remarkably well with the contourline for G4, = 1 . At high diameters close to 100mm the
contourline for G4, = 1 present a deflection and becomes horizontal. This behaviour is also
shown by the simulation with diameter 80 mm and repeated at higher frequencies in the
other figures.
The results for 30 KHz, 40KHz and 100 KHz are very similar with the corresponding shift for
the values (Figure 5, 6 and 7) due to the change of frequency. The simulations show that the
threshold for cavitation is very close to G4, = 1 and always well within 0.5 and 2.
For 1 MHz, (Figure 8), the fitting of the simulations for small diameters to the contourline
G, = 1 is very good. However, for bigger diameters, where half of the wavelength is
shorter than the radius of the probe, there is a departure of the contourline G, = 1
towards greater values of GG, . It means that for bigger diameters and high frequencies it is
easier to get regions of the fluid with lower pressures, due to the reflection of the very
directional soundwaves in the beaker walls. Consequently, a series of simulations without
allowing time for the soundwaves to be reflected on the walls have been performed and are
represented in Figure 8 as yellow squares. This yellow squares are closer to the contourline
Go=1.
