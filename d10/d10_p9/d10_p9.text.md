           Fig. 3. Pre-P background-normalized spectrogram from floating station RS16 of an Mw 6.4 earthquake east of the Solomon Islands, with an epicentral distance of
           7740 km, a hypocenter depth of 8 km, and a back-azimuth of 345°. For periods <7.0 s, PSDs were calculated using 50 s segments in 0.5 s moving increments. For
           periods >7.0 s, PSDs were calculated for 200 s intervals in 2.0 s moving increments. Red vertical lines mark ak135-predicted arrival times. Black rectangles mark the
           spectral and temporal integration bounds used for signal analysis. White and black line marks the acoustic cutoff period as estimated using Eqn (4). Red arrows
           indicate probable Lamb waves generated by S-wave arrivals at RIS grounding lines to the southeast (HHR, Eqn (6)) and to the southwest (HHT, Eqn (7)). This event
           was recorded during winter low-noise conditions when continuous sea ice in the Ross Sea strongly attenuates ocean gravity waves before they can excite the RIS
           (Baker and others, 2019) or generate strong microseisms (Anthony and others, 2015). Figure S5 shows the unnormalized spectrogram.
