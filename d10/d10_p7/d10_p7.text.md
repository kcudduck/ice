            gathers showing times are shown in Figures 3–4. Colors indicate different shot types: Poulter (black), detonating cord (50 grains/ ft; red), detonating cord (400
            grains/ ft; blue), drilled shot (green). The Poulter shots are stronger for low frequencies and comparable at high frequencies relative to the thicker detonating
            cord. The thinner detonating cord is less strong at all frequencies, and the shallowly-drilled, 300 g shot is the weakest at all frequencies. Bold lines are the average
            frequency amplitude for each shot type.
