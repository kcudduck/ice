ABSTRACT. Direct measurements of the properties of subglacial water are
necessary for understanding water flow beneath glaciers. In this paper we describe
the construction, calibration and ficld usage of two instruments— one that measures
turbidity and the other that measures electrical conductivity of subglacial water. The
sensors are inexpensive and reliable. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of these
devices, we present samples of data obtained from beneath Trapridge Glacier, Yukon
Territory, Canada.
