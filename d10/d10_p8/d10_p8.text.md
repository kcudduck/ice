                             ABSTRACT. Direct measurements of the properties of subglacial water are
                             necessary for understanding water flow beneath glaciers. In this paper we describe
                             the construction, calibration and field usage of two instruments-one that measures
                             turbidity and the other that measures electrical conductivity of sub glacial water. The
                             sensors are inexpensive and reliable. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of these
                             devices, we present samples of data obtained from beneath Trapridge Glacier, Yukon
                             Territory, Canada.

       For subglacial measurements, a calibration relating T
   to suspended-sediment concentration is unrealizable,

   limited number of samples. We have made numerous
   laboratory tests in which the suspended-sediment con-
   centration, for a given grain-size distribution, was
   controlled carefully. Our investigations have shown that
   turbidity depends strongly on the grain-size distribution
   of the suspension; smaller grains comprising less total mass
   can produce turbidity values much greater than larger
