                                             Glacial ice is interactive with Earth's climate change. As a complex multiscale medium, its composite struc-
                                             ture varies from millimeters to kilometers (Golden et al., 2020). How the small-scale ice structures influence
                                             coarse-grained climate models is an ongoing research question. To answer this question, we need to know the phys-
                                             ical processes acting on the ice sheet, such as ice dynamics and thermodynamics (Conway & Rasmussen, 2009;
                                             Lai et al., 2020; Sergienko, 2022). Seismic surveys record vibrations traveling through rock and ice with their

                     imaging using the reflected SH waves and interpret the reflector as a boundary of grain-size change. Finally, we
                     discuss the feasibility of estimating petrophysical properties from multiple component data.

                     Ambient noise cross-correlation is an effective seismic method to study Earth's structure (Shearer, 2019). Surface
                     waves are generally the strongest signals observed in noise cross-correlation, which makes high-resolution surface
                     wave tomography possible (Hu et al., 2020; Jaxybulatov et al., 2014; Shapiro et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007).
                     Surface waves are also preferred to investigate seismic anisotropy due to their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
                     and observable dispersion splitting caused by anisotropy (S. X. Zhang et al., 2009; Chaput et al., 2022). Indeed,
                     shear waves enable better constraints on seismic anisotropy in ice sheets compared to P waves (Diez et al., 2016).
                     Surface wave dispersion curve inversion has been widely used for imaging the shallow structures of the Antarc-
                     tic (Diez et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2021; Picotti et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018). The derived 1D velocity models
                     are first-order approximations of a heterogeneous Earth. More advanced 2D/3D inversion algorithms such as
                     wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion (Z.-D. Zhang & Alkhalifah, 2019b) and full-waveform inversion
                     methods (Pan et al., 2021) are then proposed to handle the lateral variations in the near-surface. The main benefits
                     of the wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion method over traditional 1D inversion methods are that (a)
                     it can handle lateral variations; (b) it avoids picking dispersion curves; (c) it utilizes both the fundamental and
                     higher modes of Rayleigh and Love waves and (d) the inversion can be solved using gradient-based optimization
                     algorithms. Different from the classic waveform inversion method, the proposed inversion measures the differ-
                     ence of the frequency-dependent phase velocity (f-v spectrum). The f-v spectrum retains the important dispersion
                     features and at the same time reduces the inherent complexity of waveforms, which reduces the non-linearity of
                     inversion. We thus adopt the wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion method to estimate the shear wave
                     velocities of shallow ice sheets.

                     Cross-correlation of noise in principle can extract the complete Green's function between two stations, including
                     any reflections, multiples, or scattered waves. Body waves detected from noise cross-correlation have also been
                     used to study the deep Earth (Boué et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013). Horizontally polarized (SH) waves have many
                     advantages over the traditional compressional (P) waves or vertically polarized (SV) waves in imaging layer
                     boundaries (Woolery et al., 1993; J. Li et al., 2019; Mecking et al., 2021). Specifically, SH waves have a shorter
                     wavelength than P waves at comparable frequencies, facilitating a higher spatial resolution. SH waves are also
                     decoupled from P and SV waves in an isotropic medium, incurring a cleaner image. Besides, SH reflections are
                     often better separated from surface waves than P or converted waves in a near-surface imaging setting. In practice,
                     SH waves extracted from ambient noise can penetrate to the deep earth's interior (H. Li et al., 2010; Shearer, 2019)
                     and are also useful for shallow structural imaging (Draganov et al., 2009; Gu et al., 2021; Nakata et al., 2011). In a
                     seismic reflection survey carried out on the Alpine glacier Colle Gnifetti, SH-wave bed reflections fit the ice-core
                     length better than P-wave bed reflections (Diez et al., 2014). But reliable controlled excitation of shear waves is
                     expensive on land and not yet developed in the marine environment (Bakulin & Calvert, 2005). Ambient noise
                     cross-correlation can effectively extract SH-reflections regardless of the environment. In our study, the extracted
                     SH reflections from ambient noise provide unique information about an englacial seismic discontinuity observed
                     at about 1,700 km depth near West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide Camp.

                     Seismic data recorded at Earth's surface preserve the time history of seismic waves traveling in the Earth's inte-
                     rior (Levin, 1984). We need cutting-edge processing methods to extract useful geological information from
                     massive seismic observations. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a seismic imaging method to map the subsurface
                     reflectivity using reflected waves. Reverse time migration (RTM) calculates reflector images where the down-
                     going waves meet the waves that travel up (Claerbout, 1971) and it involves three steps: (a) forward modeling
                     of seismic wavefields through given velocity models and sources as well as (b) backpropagating time-reversed
                     seismic reflections using the same velocity models, and (c) applying the imaging condition (e.g., a zero-lag
                     cross-correlation of forward- and backward-propagated wavefields). As a wavefield-based imaging method,
                     RTM takes complete physics (e.g., elasticity, anisotropy, and attenuation) into consideration and does not have
                     layer-model assumptions often required by ray-based imaging methods. Although the computational cost is also
                     higher than ray-based methods, rapid improvements in computational power and developments in dense array
                     acquisitions make wavefield-based imaging methods possible for solving large-scale imaging problems.

                     (Conway & Rasmussen, 2009). The spatial sampling is 30 m and the total length of the acquisition line is 2.25 km.



                     2. Study Site
                     The WAIS is a segment of the continental ice sheet covering the West Antarctic. As a marine-based ice sheet,
                     its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS has contributed to significant
                     loss of ice and rise in sea level since the beginning of the twenty-first century, due to the rapid thinning, retreat,
                     and acceleration of major outlet glaciers (Meredith et al., 2019). Geological and glaciological data have been
                     collected to study the asymmetric pattern of thickness change across the divide. The WAIS Divide Core data
                     allow us to learn about the crystal orientation fabric of ice (Fitzpatrick et al., 2014) and to recover the historical
                     Holocene accumulation rate (Koutnik et al., 2016). Seismic surveys, which are more cost-effective than deep ice
                     drilling, are also conducted to study the composite structure of ice near the WAIS Divide drilling site. Similarly,
                     polarimetric ice-penetrating radar measurements are also able to detect anisotropic fabric patterns using birefrin-
                     gence of ice crystals at radar frequencies (Young et al., 2021).

                     In this study, we use seismic data collected in January 2019 from a temporary deployment located about 5 km north-
                     east of the WAIS Divide Camp and extending about 2.5 km along-flow toward the Walgreen Coast. The deploy-
                     ment consists of 100 3-component, Z-Land Gen2, 5 Hz Magseis Fairfield seismic nodes (Ringler et al., 2018).
                     Nodes were buried at 30 cm depth, leveled with a bubble level, and oriented using an Antarctica-weighted Brun-
                     ton compass. The nodes recorded continuously with a sampling rate of 1,000 samples per second. Seventy-six
                     nodes were deployed along a 2.25-km-long line with 30-m spacing as shown in Figure 1. Twenty-four nodes
                     deployed in a 500-m diameter circle at the same time are the subject of other studies (Chaput et al., 2022).
                     These seismic node configurations were designed to record controlled seismic source tests during January 2019
                     (Karplus et al., 2019), but they are also very useful for passive seismic studies, as we show in this paper. The
                     seismic line used in this study follows the same location as a previous controlled-source seismic reflection line
                     collected in 2008–2009 (Horgan et al., 2011, Figure 1b) and is partially colocated with a radar line collected in
                     2020 (Young et al., 2021).

                                          We have a 1-week continuous recording of ambient noise on the line of Magseis Fairfield 3-component nodes. We
                                          calculate the node-to-node correlations of vertical-vertical (ZZ), vertical-radial (ZR) and transverse-transverse
                                          (TT) data components. Specifically, the sequential processing steps are (a) instrument response removal,
                                                                                     (                     )
                                          (b) time-domain trace normalization𝐴𝐴         ̂ = 𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)∕|𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)| , (c) spectral whitening
                                                                                       𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)                                    𝐴𝐴    (𝐷𝐷(𝜔𝜔)
                                                                                                                                         ̂     = 𝐷𝐷(𝜔𝜔)∕|𝐷𝐷(𝜔𝜔)|,
                                          1 Hz < ω < 38 Hz), (d) cross-correlation calculated in the frequency domain (Bensen et al., 2007) and (e)
                                          time-domain waveform-similarity weighted stacking (Z.-D. Zhang et al., 2020). Figure 2 shows example virtual
                                          shot gathers of ZZ, ZR and TT components, respectively. Rayleigh waves are mainly reconstructed from the ZZ-
                                          and ZR-component data, while Love waves are primarily recorded in the TT-component data according to their
                                          particle motion difference. There are also body waves that are weak in amplitudes compared with surface waves.
                                          The TT-component data seem to have relatively stronger body waves and noise than the ZZ- and ZR-component
                                          data. We also observe a trace with an anomalously late arrival time for the ZZ-component data (marked by a
                                          green arrow in Figure 2). We continue with calculating the horizontal and the vertical particle velocity ratio
                                          (H/V ratio) of traces that are close to that trace. As shown in Figure 3, the trace with traveltime anomaly (black
                                          line) shows a different H/V ratio with its neighboring traces for different (virtual) sources. In contrast, its neigh-
                                          boring traces on both sides share similar H/V ratios. The H/V ratio difference may attribute to the site effects
                                          according to Sylvette et al. (2006). We will investigate the cause of such a difference in the 2D inversion section.
                                          We then calculate the frequency-slowness spectra of the ZZ- and TT-component data in the following way: (a)

                                          and large (900 m) offsets away from the virtual source for visualization. The selected traces are fixed while the virtual sources
                                          are varying. They suggest that the 38th trace shows a different H/V ratio from its neighboring traces.

                     Figure 4. Example frequency-slowness spectra of the ZZ and TT data shown in Figure 2. Rayleigh and Love waves are
                     clearly shown in ZZ and TT data (white arrows), respectively. The yellow arrows point to weak body S-waves with a velocity
                     of around 2 km/s. A cloud of energy with high velocity (about 3.3 km/s) marked by a magenta arrow is identified in TT data.
                     It is well separated from the Love wave in slowness.


                     We decompose the time-domain data to mono-frequency components. (b) We use the slant stacking to convert
                     the data in the frequency-offset domain to their dispersion spectra in the frequency-slowness domain. We calcu-
                     late the spectra using traces at least 300 m away from the virtual shot trace. As expected, we observe strong
                     fundamental modes of Rayleigh and Love waves from the frequency-slowness spectra of ZZ and TT data, respec-
                     tively. There are also weak SV and SH body waves pointed to by the yellow arrows. We also observe relatively
                     strong waves with a phase velocity of about 3.3 km/s, which could be the leaking mode of P waves and are not
                     used for inversion.


                     4. 1D Dispersion Curve Inversion
                     We pick the Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves from frequency-slowness spectra of ZZ- and TT-component
                     data as shown in Figure 4, respectively. The picker seeks the slowness corresponding to the peak amplitude at
                     each frequency. We use the inversion algorithm developed by Haney and Tsai (2017), which assumes a layered
                     Earth, to estimate the 1D velocity profiles. The inversion is based on weighted-damped least squares and thus
                     effectively generates smoothly varying velocity estimation in depth. We start with linearly increasing velocity
                     and density models and keep P-wave velocity and density fixed during the inversion. Figure 5a shows the initial
                     and inverted 1D vertical shear-wave velocities. A low-velocity (<1,400 m/s) layer at shallow depths (<30 m) is
                     reconstructed after inversion. The inverted velocities increase with depth and become almost constant at depths
                     greater than 100 m. The inverted velocity model overall agrees with the published velocity models in the Western
                     Antarctic (Diez et al., 2016; Picotti et al., 2015). The data comparison shown in Figures 5c and 5d indicate that
                     the inversion algorithm does a decent job of matching the observed dispersion curve. Data residuals at both ends
                     of frequencies (lower than 1.5 Hz or higher than 25 Hz) are minor. The limited span of nodes (about 2.5 km)
                     and relatively sparse node sampling (about 30 m) cast the lower and upper limits for resolvable surface waves. It
                     requires that the lowest frequency should be above 1 Hz to record one cycle of the surface waves. Meanwhile, the
                     frequency should be lower than 20 Hz to avoid data aliasing (i.e., at least two nodes per wavelength, assuming the
                     shallow velocity is 1,200 m/s). The sensitivity kernel of the Rayleigh wave (Figure 5b) provides a way to evaluate
                     the accuracy of the inverted velocity model. Higher data sensitivity usually means a more reliable reconstruction
                     of the velocity model at that depth. The inversion progressively boosts the weak data sensitivities, and thus, we
                     can have model updates in depths below 100 m in this example. However, the estimated velocity in such depth is
                     more vulnerable to noise and other factors that may contaminate the velocity model.

                     We use the inverted vertical shear-wave velocity as the starting model for the Love wave dispersion curve inver-
                     sion. As shown in Figure 6, the velocity discrepancy indicates radial anisotropy on this site. Shear waves prop-
                     agate faster in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction in the upmost few meters (<10 m). The
                     fast-propagation direction becomes horizontal below around 10 m depth, which is reasonable for gravity sedi-
                     mentary and crystalline fabric of ice. This observation also agrees with the findings from Picotti et al. (2015).

                     velocity mismatch before and after inversion. A significant mismatch between observed and inverted phase-velocity
                     dispersion curves at low frequencies may be reasonable due to the limited survey line.


                     However, the estimated Vsh in depths below 100 m is presumably larger than the actual values, as indicated by the
                     data mismatch at low frequencies shown in Figures 6c and 6d. The predicted dispersion curve is slightly higher
                     than the observed one below 5 Hz, which indicates that the velocity is likely overestimated below 100 m (the
                     penetration depth is about one-third of the wavelength). This data residual, of course, can be further reduced by
                     lifting the model regularization. However, we need the model regularization to avoid data overfitting, especially
                     for real data applications. The Love wave data sensitivity (Figure 6b) reduces rapidly as depth increase, which
                     indicates that the estimated Vsh has a large uncertainty beyond 200 m depth. Besides, the TT-component data are
                     also noisy, preventing a more exact data fitting.

                     1D dispersion curve inversion, as a widely used inversion method, provides some insights into the velocity
                     structure averaged along the line. However, it also sacrifices the lateral resolution to the subsurface. Though a
                     fine-tuned pseudo-2D inversion (e.g., multiple 1D profiles along a line) can add some lateral variations (Zigone
                     et al., 2015), the layer-model assumption is still a strong approximation for heterogeneous earth. In the next
                     section, we will apply the 2D wave-equation-based dispersion spectrum inversion method to the data set, which
                     considers the more complete physics of wave propagation.


                     5. 2D Wave-Equation Dispersion Spectrum Inversion
                     The wave-equation dispersion curve inversion method was introduced by Z.-D. Zhang et al. (2015). The idea
                     is to replace the multilayer dispersion computation (Haskell, 1953) with more advanced wave-equation solu-
                     tions, where a heterogeneous model can be used. Later, Z.-D. Zhang and Alkhalifah (2019b) replaced the picked
                     dispersion curves with the whole dispersion spectrum as the input data and derived the formula for gradient
                     calculation. The inversion method becomes practically useful for processing large-volume data sets and has been
                     used for solving problems across scales (Z.-D. Zhang et al., 2021). The workflow is similar to the widely used

                     ment of the predicted and observed f-v spectra. After obtaining the virtual common-shot-gathers, we first trans-
                     form the time-domain waveform data to the frequency domain (f-x data, x denotes offsets) and then calculate their
                     dispersion spectra (f-v) using the linear Radon transform (Luo et al., 2008). By maximizing the local similarities
                     between the predicted and f-v spectra, we obtain the optimal shear-wave velocity estimation for the subsurface
                     (Z.-D. Zhang & Alkhalifah, 2019b).

                     We solve the seismic wave propagation problem using the spectral element method (Komatitsch & Tromp, 1999).
                     We first estimate the vertical shear-wave velocity using Rayleigh waves convoluted with Ricker wavelets with
                     peak frequencies of 8 and 12 Hz, sequentially. We choose these frequencies for the following reasons: (a) the
                     calculated empirical Green's functions have a peak frequency of around 8 Hz and (b) the length and receiver
                     sampling of the array suggest low and high limits for the useful frequencies. The array should record 2–3 cycles
                     of surface waves for a reliable calculation of the f-v spectra and meanwhile, one cycle of surface waves should
                     be recorded by at least two receivers to avoid aliasing (Foti et al., 2018). The source wavelet used for forward
                     modeling is the time integral of the Ricker wavelet with the same peak frequency. Notably this will implicitly
                     apply a time derivative to the calculated empirical Green's functions. A point-source to line-source correction is
                     also applied to transform seismic data recorded in a 3D real world to a 2D computation domain (Pica et al., 1990).
                     The shear-wave velocity is updated iteratively using the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
                     (l-BFGS) algorithm (Liu & Nocedal, 1989). The inversion converges in 2 hr with eight computation nodes and
                     each node is equipped with 40 threads. Figure 7 shows the inverted shear-wave velocities using 76 virtual shot
                     gathers. The history of velocity model updates is also provided in the Supporting Information Figure S1. The
                     inverted Vsv model also indicates a low-velocity layer (<30 m) on top of an almost constant velocity layer (about
                     2 km/s). The lateral variation is mild as we can expect for the ice sheet. Following the inversion strategy we used

                     model is quite close to the starting model and has no significant updates below 200 m (e.g., Vsh/Vsv − 1 ≈ 0
                     in Figure 7). We also measure the radial anisotropy using the Vsh and Vsv ratio. An interesting observation is
                     that the measured radial anisotropy shows evident lateral variations in the shallow layer. The transition point is
                     coincidentally close to the anomaly trace we observed from the ZZ data (Figure 2). The inverted Vsh is in general
                     greater than Vsv and the maximum velocity difference is about 8%. There is no significant difference in Vsh
                     and Vsv at depths below 200 m due to the vanished Love-wave data sensitivity. For a better comparison, we also
                     extract three vertical profiles at different lateral locations marked by dashed lines in the 2D inversion results. As
                     shown in Figure 8, the estimated velocities using the 2D inversion are not far from those obtained from a 1D
                     inversion due to the mild lateral variation in this region (see the Supporting Information Figure S1 for a direct
                     comparison). The derived radial anisotropy in the firn layer can be strongly heterogeneous due to the variable and
                     often loose compaction of the snow. The ice layer presents a consistent radial anisotropy due to the layering of ice.
                     The horizontal shear wave velocity is always larger than the vertical one. The directional velocity difference has
                     a maximum of 8% and also varies laterally. There is not much difference between horizontal and vertical S-wave
                     velocities beyond 200 m because of the reduced data sensitivity at those depths.



                     6. Firn-Air Thickness Estimation
                     Following the work of Diez et al. (2014), we further estimate the top of the ice and the thickness of firn-air
                     content from the inverted S-wave velocities. The first step is to convert the estimated S-wave velocity to density
                     using their empirical relationship (Diez et al., 2014),

                     inverted from the 1D inversion. The lateral variation of shear wave velocity is mild in this region. However, the horizontal
                     and vertical velocity ratio shows a more significant change with locations. A transition from a positive radial anisotropy ratio
                     (Vsh > Vsv) to a negative value (Vsh < Vsv) for the upper 30 m happens near the 38th trace location. The layer composed
                     of firn (30–150 m) always has a more higher shear wave velocity in the horizontal direction. The deep layer shows no clear
                     velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions, which is significantly different from the 1D inversion.

                     ice density. We use a 1D S-wave velocity, which is an average of vertical and horizontal S-wave velocities as
                     shown in Figures 7a and 7b, as Vs(z). The S-wave velocity for ice (Vs,ice = 1,930 m/s) is picked from depths around
                     100 m, where the inverted velocity is almost constant.

                     The firn basement is at the pore close-off depth, that is, a density of 830 kg/m 3. The depth of firn basement is at
                     a depth of approximately 62 m. In comparison, Battle et al. (2011) estimated the total firn thickness to be about
                     67–77 m at WAIS Divide by analyzing collected air samples from two holes (WDC05-B and WDC05-C). Diez
                     et al. (2016) measured a firn thickness of 47 m at Ross Ice Shelf using the empirical law and 1D velocities. The

                     We use the ice depth of 62 m and obtain the firn-air content thickness, which is about 17 m. Our finding is in
                     good agreement with Munneke et al. (2014) and Diez et al. (2016), who modeled firn-air content thickness to be
                     about 20 and 18 m, respectively, on the Ross Ice Shelf. The firn-air content thickness is a key factor in assessing
                     ice-shelf stability. Although our study area is on an ice-sheet, the proposed method can be easily applied to seis-
                     mic data collected on ice shelves.


                     7. Inversion Uncertainty Analysis
                     It is important to know which features of the inverted 2D models are well resolved and thus are reliable. In this
                     study, we are particularly interested in knowing the maximum resolvable depth of the inverted S-wave veloci-
                     ties. Checkerboard tests and point-spread function tests are two traditional uncertainty quantification methods
                     that can do this task. However, they also suffer from huge computational demand and limited spatial resolution.
                     Alternatively, we use a finite-difference approximation to calculate the depth sensitivity of Rayleigh and Love
                     waves' dispersion spectra, also known as the Frechét derivatives. Specifically, we first divide the inverted S-wave
                     velocities (Figures 7a and 7b) into 10 layers and assign 10% perturbations to each layer. Then we calculate the
                     synthetic waveform data using the background and perturbed models. Finally, we quantify the dispersion spec-
                     trum perturbations caused by S-wave velocity perturbations at variable depths for frequencies of interest. Figure 9
                     shows the calculated depth sensitivities of Rayleigh and Love waves used in this study. In general, high-frequency
                     data are sensitive to a shallow depth and vice versa. Love waves are more sensitive to a shallower depth than
                     Rayleigh waves at the same frequencies. These observations agree with the results from traditional 1D inversions
                     (Figures 5c and 6c). From the available frequencies (i.e., about 5–15 Hz from Figure 4), we confirm that the
                     inverted velocities (e.g., Figure 7) are robustly constructed in the top 200 m. The vanished radial anisotropy below
                     200 m depth is more likely caused by the reduced depth sensitivity of Love waves.

                     We then show the history of data convergence for each inversion stage in Figure 10. The inversion stops when
                     there are no significant updates. No gold standard exists for an acceptable misfit reduction in real data applica-
                     tions. But the data misfit reduction in our case is sufficient compared to a real-data example (e.g., Figure 14 in
                     Vigh et al. (2014)). We further compare the dispersion spectra and waveforms before and after inversion to better
                     understand the data agreement. Notably, the waveform data are not directly used by the inversion algorithm and
                     thus can indicate whether the inversion has a balanced data fitting. Figure 11 shows the Rayleigh wave dispersion
                     spectra of the observed, initially predicted and finally predicted ZZ- and ZR-component data, respectively. The
                     predicted dispersion spectra from the inverted shear-wave velocity match the observed ones reasonably well.
                     The objective function used for inversion focuses on matching the curvature of the dispersion spectrum. This
                     is reasonable for real data applications because the amplitude can be influenced by many factors that are not

                     considered in the numerical simulation, such as attenuation and noise. We continue with showing the waveform
                     comparison in Figures 12 and 13. Note that we do not use the waveform difference in our objective function.
                     The accuracy of waveforms calculated from the correlated wavefields is still in debate (Nakata et al., 2013).
                     Instead, we measure the slope of arrivals, which is an indicator of the accuracy of the estimated velocity model.
                     Figures 12a and 13a are the observed ZZ- and ZR-component data, respectively. The initially predicted ZZ and
                     ZR waveforms from the linearly increasing velocity model are shown in Figures 12 and 13b, respectively. We
                     calculate the non-zero lag cross-correlation of the observed and initially predicted ZZ and ZR data shown in
                     Figures 12c and 13c. A black dashed line is added to aid the evaluation of the flatness of correlated traces. The
                     flatness of the cross-correlation functions along traces indicates the accuracy of the inverted velocity model.
                     The side-lobe of the cross-correlation function indicates the accuracy of the dispersion feature of the recon-
                     structed Rayleigh waves from the inverted shear velocity. We ignore the constant time lag since it is related to the
                     origin time of the source wavelet, which will not affect our inversion. The improvement in waveform similarity
                     after inversion is clearly shown in Figures 12d and 13d. A notable difference is that the numerically predicted
                     waveform amplitudes are stronger for high-frequency data, while the observed data seem to have a stronger
                     amplitude for the low-frequency data. Presumably the attenuation that happens in the real Earth can explain such
                     difference, where an opportunity for attenuation factor (Q) estimation exists. The cross-correlation functions
                     shown in Figures 12e and 13e further confirm the improvements in waveform similarity after inversion. The
                     cross-correlation function becomes flat and spiky along traces.

                     We also show the dispersion spectra of Love waves in Figure 14. The observed Love wave dispersion spectrum
                     is dominated by low-frequency energies as shown in Figure 14a. The inverted dispersion spectrum (Figure 14b)
                     matches the observed one reasonably well at low frequencies (<15 Hz). The finally predicted dispersion spec-
                     trum fails to match the observed one at higher frequencies, partially because the dispersion energy is too weak
                     to be utilized. By visually checking the dispersion spectra at high frequencies, we can find that the predicted
                     spectrum has a higher phase velocity than the observed one. Using the general mapping relationship between the

                     Figure 11. Frequency-velocity spectra of the observed, initial and inverted Rayleigh waves. We plot the ZZ and ZR data
                     for the first virtual source data. The inverted f-v spectra have a better agreement with the observed ones than the initially
                     predicted data.


                     available frequency and the penetration depth, we anticipate that our estimated Vsh model has a higher velocity
                     than the actual case in the very shallow layer. The waveform data shown in Figure 15a are apparently noisier
                     than ZZ and ZR data. Body waves, including primary arrivals and reflections from a deep layer, are also visually
                     seen. The finally predicted waveform data (Figure 15b) are close to the observed one in terms of the slopes.
                     The cross-correlation function is also flattened along traces (Figure 15c). But we do see some side-lobes of the
                     cross-correlation function, those nearly-flat ones are due to the imperfect prediction for the velocity model and
                     the dipping ones are just crosstalks between the observed body waves and the simulated Love waves. We antic-
                     ipate that the reflection SH waves marked by the yellow arrow could be from a deep discontinuity, where RTM
                     imaging can help with finding their origins.


                     8. Reverse Time Migration Imaging Using Reflection SH Waves
                     Normally, body wave energy is weak and hard to extract from ambient noise, and hence we need extra steps
                     for body-wave extraction (Nakata et al., 2011, 2015). In this data set, because we have transverse components
                     and surface waves are not overlapped to body waves, the reflected SH waves are coherently extracted from the
                     recorded ambient noise by examining several virtual shot gathers. Figures 16a–16c show three example shot gath-
                     ers with different virtual source locations. We apply a time-selection window to highlight the reflection waves.
                     By stacking the nearby two traces on both sides of the virtual source, we can obtain the so-called zero-offset
                     profile shown in Figure 16d. The two-way traveltime (TWT) of the image is the traveltime of the SH wave from
                     the virtual source to the reflector and then back to the receiver co-located with the virtual source. TWT can be
                     converted to depth by using prior interval velocities. The time-domain image (Figure 16d) shows a dipping reflec-
                     tor that causes the reflections observed in the TT-component data, which is also confirmed by the moveout differ-
                     ence observed in Figure 16b. The (apparent) slope of SH reflection waves on both sides of the virtual source is
                     asymmetric. Since the lateral variation of velocity is mild in the study area, such slope difference is likely caused

                     a first glance of the reflector. The imaging method is robust since it is directly from the observation data. But it
                     cannot provide accurate depth or dipping angle of reflectors.
                     Here we calculate the RTM image using the time-windowed SH reflections (Nakata et al., 2015). We extend the
                     Vsh model (Figure 7) by flooding with a constant velocity of 1,994 m/s below 150 m and propagating seismic
                     waves using the spectral element method. We scale the velocity value by 0.5 to get the density model, which is
                     an approximation to a derived relationship between velocity and density (Diez et al., 2014). We anticipate that
                     the density error will have a minimal imprint on the velocity estimation due to weak data sensitivity. Figure 17
                     shows the raw RTM image and its envelope for better visualization. Due to the poor illumination at boundaries
                     and the lack of near-offset reflections (see Figure 16 for evidence), we have a limited range of imaging with
                     high quality. The reflector image is spread in-depth due to the relatively low-frequency range (5–15 Hz) used for
                     imaging. We show the trace-normalized envelope of the raw RTM image in Figure 17b. A solid green line marks
                     a dipping reflector at about 1,700 m depth. The poor data quality interprets a lateral discontinuity marked by the
                     yellow dashed line as imaging artifacts. The lateral depth variation of the imaged reflector is also questionable
                     due to poor data quality. However, the RTM image agrees well with the time-domain image unraveling a dipping
                     reflector.

                     Reflecting SH wave imaging using ambient-noise data may provide unique illumination to the subsurface.
                     Reflection SH waves are well separated from the surface waves, as shown in this example. PSV or PP reflections
                     largely overlap with surface waves, which prevents their practical use for reflection imaging. Furthermore, SH
                     reflections are purely seismic responses to abrupt changes in shear impedance. By examining the different reac-
                     tions of P- and S-wave to the structures in the subsurface, we can predict the physical process of the subsurface.
                     In this study, we did not find clear PP or PSV reflections related to the imaged reflector by searching for possible

                     the reflectors. A combination of P- and S-wave responses can infer the petrophysical change in the subsurface
                     (Loh et al., 2017; Vanorio et al., 2005). Three different combinations of P- and S-wave responses correspond
                     to three different boundary conditions. To be specific, (a) a variation in rock matrix but not in pore fluid can
                     generate strong P- and S-wave reflections, (b) No variations in rock matrix but in pore fluid can generate strong
                     P-wave but weak S-wave reflections, (c) A mineralogy, cementation and porosity condition change can generate
                     weak P-wave but strong S-wave reflections. In this study, we only observed reflected SH waves from a particular
                     discontinuity, which the porosity change of ice can explain. It is also possible that surface waves hide P-wave
                     reflections due to their overlaps in traveltime, but the chance is not high for reflections at near-offsets. Aside
                     from a cross-comparison with P-waves, the amplitude variation with offset of SH waves may provide additional

                                             10. Conclusions
                                             In this study, we show how seismic imaging can help us estimate the petrophysical parameters of ice and further
                                             uncover ice dynamics. The wave equation dispersion spectrum inversion method can provide reliable estimations
                                             for heterogeneous shear-wave velocities. Compared with conventional 1D inversion results, our new results also
                                             provide additional information about the lateral variation of shear-wave velocities. We further estimate thick-
                                             nesses of firn-air content and firn from the inverted 2D model. The radial anisotropy of firn and shallow ice
                                             derived from the inverted velocities shows a higher resolution than the velocities themselves. A lateral variation
                                             is clearly shown and the transition point co-located with the anomaly trace observed from the ZZ data. The
                                             inversion uncertainty analysis indicates that the top 200 m of the inverted models are well-resolved. The vanished
                                             radial anisotropy below 200 m is likely caused by reduced data sensitivity of Love waves. We also observe SH
                                             reflections from the TT data and calculate seismic images of the reflectors using a robust and straightforward
                                             time-domain imaging method and a more advanced RTM method. We link the seismic discontinuity to porosity
                                             changes at that depth by comparing the P- and S-wave responses.
