                                        SUMMARY
                                        We present a new seismic shear wave velocity model of the upper mantle of the Antarctic
                                        Plate region, AP2024. It includes the lithosphere and underlying mantle down to 660 km
                                        depth beneath both the continental and oceanic portions of the plate. To augment the limited
                                        seismic station coverage of Antarctica, we assemble very large regional and global data
                                        sets, comprising all publicly available broad-band seismic data. The model is built using
                                        785 thousand seismograms from over 27 thousand events and 8.7 thousand stations. It is
                                        constrained by both body and Rayleigh surface waves, ensuring the dense data sampling of
                                        the entire upper mantle depth range. The tomographic inversion is global but focused on the
                                        Antarctic Plate, with the data sampling maximized in the Southern Hemisphere, with elaborate
                                        automated and manual outlier analysis and removal performed on the regional data, and with
                                        the regularization tuned for the region. The upper mantle of the Antarctic continent exhibits
                                        a bimodal nature. The sharp boundary along the trans-Antarctic mountains separates the
                                        cratonic eastern from tectonic western Antarctica and shows a shear-velocity contrast of up to
                                        17 per cent at ∼100 km depth. The bimodal pattern is also seen in the oceanic part of the plate,
                                        with the older oceanic lithosphere beneath the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean showing
                                        higher shear velocities. The continental lithosphere in East Antarctica shows high velocity
                                        anomalies similar to those beneath stable cratons elsewhere around the world. It is laterally
                                        heterogeneous and exhibits significant thinning in the near-coastal parts of Dronning Maud
                                        Land and Wilkes Land. A low velocity channel is observed along the southern front of the
                                        West Antarctic Rift System and is probably related to Cenozoic rifting. High seismic velocity
                                        anomalies are detected beneath the Antarctic Peninsula and are likely to indicate fragments of
                                        the recently subducted Phoenix Plate Slab. Low velocity anomalies beneath Marie Byrd Land
                                        extend into the deep upper mantle and are consistent with a deep mantle upwelling feeding
