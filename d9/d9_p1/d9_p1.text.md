Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse
1A from reduced Southern Ocean overturning

During the last glacial termination, the upwelling strength of the southern polar limb of the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation varied, changing the ventilation and stratiﬁcation
of the high-latitude Southern Ocean. During the same period, at least two phases of abrupt
global sea-level rise—meltwater pulses—took place. Although the timing and magnitude of
these events have become better constrained, a causal link between ocean stratiﬁcation, the
meltwater pulses and accelerated ice loss from Antarctica has not been proven. Here we
simulate Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the last 25 kyr using a data-constrained ice-sheet
model forced by changes in Southern Ocean temperature from an Earth system
model. Results reveal several episodes of accelerated ice-sheet recession, the largest being
coincident with meltwater pulse 1A. This resulted from reduced Southern Ocean overturning
following Heinrich Event 1, when warmer subsurface water thermally eroded grounded
marine-based ice and instigated a positive feedback that further accelerated ice-sheet retreat.

LGM elevation or thickness change from present. Geologically interpreted LGM grounding-line positions shown with dashed line18. Marginal
panels show time series of modelled surface elevation changes at each of the ice core sites. Simulated LGM to present-day elevation change and thickness
at each ice core site are shown in bold and parenthesis respectively. ‘LGM’ in this case is deﬁned as the maximum elevation/thickness reached
during the period 25–20 ka BP, thus may not be contemporaneous between sites. Red squares denote present-day ice-sheet surface elevations.
