Firn and ﬁrn aquifers

By Isabelle Wicks

What is ﬁrn?
Firn is a material that is halfway between snow and glacier ice. It is deﬁned as snow that has
remained on a glacier for at least one year without being melted during the summer. It is not
completely solid like ice, but it is also not light and ﬂuﬀy like snow. Instead, ﬁrn has a texture and
appearance much like wet sugar.

Unlike snowﬂakes, ﬁrn grains are not hexagonal, and they contain much less air content.

Firn is a store of meltwater
Due to having some air space between the individual grains, ﬁrn can act like a sponge and store
water. When snow melts on the surface of the glacier, the water produced by melting (known as
meltwater) can travel down into the air space of the ﬁrn and stay there1,2. The snow above, which is a
good insulator due to the air trapped between snowﬂakes, protects the ﬁrn layer from cold conditions
and means that this meltwater can remain as a liquid2. However, this does not always occur and
meltwater can also refreeze, forming layers of ice within the ﬁrn3.

How does ﬁrn form?
When snow falls onto a glacier, it settles, much like it does on the roof of a house. If the snow lasts for
at least one year and does not melt in summer, then it begins to transform into ﬁrn. The weight of
new snow on top of the year-old snow begins to compact it, slowly squeezing air out and changing the
shape of the snowﬂakes into pointy grains of snow1.

Under enough pressure, these pointy snow grains are forced into closer and closer contact with one
another, forming a mesh of grains with an uneven but connected air space5, known as ﬁrn.

Typically, ﬁrn will exist for 100-300 years before being transformed into glacial ice, but in some very
cold and dry regions of Antarctica, such as at the South Pole, ﬁrn can exist for up to 2000 years before
transforming into glacial ice4!

Where is ﬁrn found?
Firn covers ~99% of the Antarctic Ice Sheet surface6 and ~90% of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface7,
and is also found on the surface of glaciers, beneath fresh snow. The thickness of the ﬁrn layer varies
depending on its location, due to diﬀerent amounts of melt and snowfall; along the coastlines of
Antarctica and Greenland ﬁrn can be as shallow as several metres, and towards the centres of these
ice sheets, ﬁrn can be over 100 m thick4!

Why is ﬁrn important?
Firn helps to regulate the contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise by holding meltwater within its air
space, either as liquid water or refrozen into ice1,3. Around 45% of meltwater in Greenland and almost
all Antarctic meltwater refreezes in ﬁrn1,3, stopping it from entering the oceans and contributing to
rising sea levels. As air temperatures rise, meltwater is increasingly running oﬀ, leading to more mass
loss and increased contribution to sea level rise8.

However, the weight of meltwater and ice within the ﬁrn can also increase the pressure on the glacial
ice beneath, or it can be rapidly released into large cracks in the glacier, known as crevasses, causing
the cracks to widen and deepen5, which can lead to large areas breaking oﬀ from the ice shelf.
Understanding what ﬁrn is and how it evolves through time is critical in helping to understand how
Antarctica and Greenland will change as the atmosphere warms.

I am a PhD researcher at Northumbria University, working with the Centre for Polar Observation and
Modelling. I am interested in glacier and ice shelf dynamics, especially their interactions with
meltwater and climate. My research focusses on using the MONARCHS model to understand how
surface melt on Antarctic ice shelves impacts their stability, and how (near-)surface hydrological
networks, including ﬁrn aquifers and meltwater storage, develop through time and space. I am also
passionate about scientiﬁc outreach and getting the next generation of women and girls interested in
and excited about polar sciences.
