        THE EFFECT OF THE SUBGLACIAL WATER PRESSURE ON
            THE SLIDING VELOCITY OF A GLACIER IN AN
                   IDEALIZED NUMERICAL MODEL

                  ABSTRACT. In order to interpret observed short- term variations of the sliding velocity of a glacier the
              effect of a variable subglacial water pressure on the sliding velocity has been studied using an idealized
              numerical model. In particular the transient stages of grow ing or shrinking water-filled cavities at the ice-
              bedrock interface were analysed. It was found that the sl iding veloci ty was larger when cavities were growing
              than when they had reached the steady-state size for a given water pressure. The smallest sliding velocities
              occurred while cavi ties were shrinking. When cavitation is substantial a small drop of water pressure below
              the steady-state value (e.g. by 0.5 bar) can temporarily cause backward sliding. A limiting water pressure at
              which sliding becomes unstable is derived. The consequences of more realistic assumptions than those of the
              model are discussed.

              etudie a l'aide d'un modele numerique idealise l'effet exerce par une pression hydraulique sous-glaciaire
              variable sur la vitesse de glissement d'un glacier. On a etudie en particulier les etats transitoires de la
              croissance et de la decroissance des poches d'eau situees a l'interface glace-bedrock. II s'est revele que
              pendant la phase de croissance des cavites, la vitesse de glissement est plus grande qu'a l'etat stationnaire
              pour une pression hydraulique donnee. Les vitesses de g lissement les plus faibl es se produisent lors du
              retrecissement des cavites. Lorsque le volume des cavites est suffisamment grand, une faible diminution de la
              pression (p.ex. de 0,5 bar) peut temporairement provoquer un glissement vers l'amont. On a determine une

         INTRODUCTION

            Surface measurements of glacier movement have occasionally revealed significant changes
        of horizontal velocity within short periods of time, a few days or even a few hours (e.g. Iken,
        [1978] ). More recent short-term measurements included vertical velocity which showed
        related variations. The dependency of the velocity variations on melt- or rain-water supply
        suggested that the variations were caused by changes in subglacial water pressure. In parti-
        cular the substantial variations of vertical velocity observed in a detailed study have been
        interpreted as variations of water storage at the bed. * A mechanism explaining the typical
        features of the observations is now sought. The following water-pressure-dependent sliding
        mechanisms have been proposed in the past:
                  Sliding over a lubricated, undulating, or three-dimensionally rough bed with formation
              of water-filled cavities (Lliboutry, 1968, 1979; Kamb, 1970).

                                Change of thickness of the lubricating water film between ice and bedrock (Weertman,
                            19 62 ).
                                Deformation of saturated sediments below a glacier (Boulton, 1979; J ones, 1979).
                                Participation of subsole drift in the sliding process (Engelhard t and others, 1978;
                            Kamb and others, 1979; Boulton and others, 1979) .
                                Slip along water-activated shear planes within a glacier (Tyulina, 1976).
                       If the velocity variations are indeed caused by short-term water-pressure variations which are
                       synchronous over large areas of the glacier bed, then high permeability of the subglacial
                       drainage system is an essential assumption. This requirement is best satisfied ifbed separation
                       is extensive. Extensive bed separation also provides an appropriate explanation for the
                       variations of vertical velocity which may then be understood as the result of simultaneous
                       growth (or shrinkage) of subglacial, communicating cavities. I-t thus appears probable that
                       the velocity variations in the quoted field examples were a direct consequence of sliding over an
                       undulating bed with bed separation controlled by a varying subglacial water pressure.
                       Certainly, other mechanisms may have played a part; in particular, friction between rock
                       particles in the ice sole and below has probably modified the observed variations of the sliding
                       velocity. The present paper will be confined, however, to an understanding of the principles.
                       It concentrates on the idealized problem of sliding on a perfectly lubricated bed with the
                       action of an imposed water pressure. To a large part this problem is well known, owing to the
                       comprehensive sliding theories of Kamb (1970) and Lliboutry (1968, 1979). The pioneering
                       ideas on the action of the subglacial water pressure were developed in the original work of
                       Lliboutry, yet the transient stages of cavity growth and shrinkage have not been analysed so
                       far. It is exactly these phases, however, which seem to determine the velocity variations in
                       question.


                       FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF THE SUBGLACIAL WATER PRESSURE ACTING ON
                            A GLACIER SOLE WITH NON-UNIFORM PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION

                            In the absence of a basal shear stress the pressure which the ice exerts on its bed is every-
                       where Po, the ice overburden pressure. If, however, the basal shear stress is not zero, the
                       pressure on the bed is no longer uniform, but is larger than Po on the stoss faces of bedrock
                       protuberances and smaller on the lee faces, so that equilibrium of forces is maintained. It is
                       in the low-pressure zones at the lee faces where a change of water pressure caused by, say, a
                       change of water input into the subglacial drainage system can affect motion of the glacier even
                       if the water pressure stays well below the ice overburden pressure. The lower bound of water
                       pressure which has an effect is the minimum pressure occurring at the lee faces, the separation
                       pressure. At a larger water pressure a part of the ice sole is separated from the bed. The
                       separation pressure has been introduced and given in quantitative terms in the sliding theories
                       of Lliboutry (1968), Nye (1969), Kamb (1970), Morland (1976), and others. For the special
                       case of a sinusoidal bed the separation pressure Ps is
                                                                                             AT
                                                                                 Ps = Po- 1Ta
                        where T is the basal shear stress, A the wavelength, and a the amplitude (one half of the
                        difference of the maximum and minimum of the sine function).
                            Another important parameter is the limiting water pressure above which the sliding
                        becomes unstable, that is to say, a non-zero acceleration term enters into the balance of forces.
                        This pres;ure is well below the ice overburden pressure. C. F. Raymond and H. Rothlisberger
                        (personal communications) have independently arrived at the prediction of this pressure and
                        have derived an explicit expression.

             A simple derivation is as follows: Consider a plane-parallel slab of thickness d and oflarge
        lateral extent resting on a lubricated, undulating bed with a mean slope ex. For a moment we
        will assume a particularly simple shape of the bed: a bed consisting of rectangular steps (Fig.
         I). An ice column of unit width and length l rests on the faces band c of the steps, its weight
        is Fi = pgdl. The component perpendicular to face b is
                                              Fb = pgdl cos(f3-ex)
        and the component perpendicular to face c is
                                              Fc = pgdl sin (f3 - ex)
        where p is the density of the (ice) slab, g the acceleration due to gravity, ~ the angle which
        the stoss faces make with the down-slope direction x (Fig. I ) , and f3 -ex the angle between
        the stoss faces and the horizontal, i.e. the backward inclination of the steps.
            The corresponding mean pressures on faces band care
                                                                                cos ( ~-ex)
                                                             Pb = Fb/b = pgd               r:l

        and
                                                                                sin ( ~ - ex)

        Thus, if a water pressure pw > Pc opposes Pc there will be a net force on the ice which will
        move it upward along faces b with accelerating velocity. The limiting pressure pc will in the
        following be designated Pt-
            Equivalent expression for Pt are:
                                Po sin (f3-ex)     ( t a n ex)           T
                           PI = cos IX sin f3 = Po I - tan ~ = Po - tan f3 .
        The ice overburden pressure is Po = pgd cos ex and T = pgd sin IX is the basal shear stress.
        The last expression in Equation (2) is also appropriate if the basal shear stress is given by the
        more general expression T = fpgd sin ex wherefis a shape factor taking into account the drag
        of the valley sides. The validity of Equation (2) is not restricted to a bed consisting of
        rectangular steps; the equations hold for other two-dimensional bed undulations as well if the
        steepest tangents on the stoss faces make an angle f3 with the mean bed slope. This is readily
        seen if one assumes that the spaces between the stepped bed and another bed, for example the
        one which is sketched on the right of Figure I, are filled with a weightless liquid. Inserting
        the liquid does not affect the balance of forces and the pressure is constant over the surface

                        of the liquid. Further, the equations apply also to three-dimensionally rough beds if the
                        projection of the total area exposed to the water pressure on a plane which is normal to the
                        direction (3 is the same as in the two-dimensional case.
                            For the special case of a sinusoidal bed the steepest tangent of the stoss face is
                                                                             (tan (3) max = 27Ta/ A,
                        and thus

                             In the formulation of the overall force balance the material properties of the glacier are
                         irrelevant. However, there are differences in the pressure distribution and size of contact
                         areas when the glacier is assumed to be viscous rather than rigid. When the water pressure
                         rises to the limiting value, a rigid body on an undulating (e.g. sinusoidal) bed is in contact with
                         the bed only at the inflexion points of the stoss faces. A viscous body, however, touches the
                         bed on finite areas so that extreme stress concentrations are avoided. Consequences of this
                         difference will not be pursued further in this paper.
                             A stability limil for sliding under the action of a water pressure has already been derived
                         by Lliboutry in a different way. For the case of a sinusoidal bed he has found a maximum,
                         limiting value of the reduced frictionfwlfo of 1.325 (Lliboutry, 1968, p. 34). This value refers
                         to a maximum size of stable cavities, they cover one-half of the sinusoidal bed. By definition
                        fw = T andio = 1. 7T (2a/ A)(pO - PW ), hence Lliboutry's limiting value of the water pressure is
                                                                              Po-h/( 1.3 257Ta ).                     (4)
                        This value is smaller than that derived above (Equation (3)). The difference may result
                        from Lliboutry's assumption of a symmetric pressure distribution on a (large) contact area,
                        which has its centre well above the inflexion point of the stoss face (Lliboutry, 1968, p. 33).
                             The remaining part of this paper deals with water pressures below the limiting pressure
                        which correspond to the stable range of sliding velocities. Before discussion of the numerical
                        analysis, the effect of a water pressure which is in the range between the separation pressure
                        and the limiting water pressure will be described in a qualitative manner.
                             When water at the pressure pw in this range penetrates to the lee faces of the protuberances
                        of the glacier bed, a part of the ice sole is subjected to the boundary pressure pw and is thus
                        separated immediately from the bed, a separation which includes not only that part where
                        the normal stress had originally been smaller than pw but a larger zone as a result of a canti-
                        lever effect. In the subsequent process of cavity growth, the ice in the central part of the
                        separated zone no longer moves parallel to the bed but away from it. The lower edge of the
                        separated zone moves further along the bed while the upper edge retreats only a little from its
                        original position. Thus, the extent of that part of the ice sole which is supported by water
                        at the pressure pw becomes much larger in the course of time. When the cavity has grown to
                        its final, steady form the ice at the ceiling moves parallel to it.

                               The present analysis is based on several assumptions:
                               I. No tangential stresses at the ice-bed interface.
                               2. A linear flow law for the ice. The ice is taken to be nearly incompressible in time; more
                                  specifically, that parameter which is the linear viscous analogue of Poisson's ratio in
                                  elasticity is assigned the numerical value 0.499. Perfect incompressibility in time would
                                  require the numerical value 0.5, which is not acceptable for the finite-element program.
                               3. Plane-strain, periodic bed undulations in the xz plane.
                               4. Instant supply or drainage of water of a given pressure at all lee faces of the undulating
                                  bed.
                               5. No regelation.

        GEOMETRY OF THE MODEL

            The finite-element analysis was applied to a section representing in two dimensions a small
        part of a glacier at its base. This section (Fig. 2) was taken to be 25 m high and 60 m long.
        It is resting on an undulating bed which has a mean slope of 4°. The wavelength of the
        undulations was chosen to be 20 m, the amplitude 1.5 m. This section is part of an infinitely-
        wide ice mass which is 3 I 0 m thick (measured vertically in space) and has a surface- and bed-
        slope of 4°. Thickness and slope are the same as at the central part of the Unteraargletscher
        where series of short-term movement measurements have been made.

        METHOD OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

            The calculations were carried out with the finite-element program ST AUB. This
        computer program and a related plotting program were developed at the Institut fUr
        Strassen-, Fels-, und Eisenbahnbau, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Zurich, for the
        purpose of stress and strain analysis in tunnel construction work (Kovari and others, 1976).
        Different program versions for elastic and plastic materials and for substances with composite
        properties exist. For the present purpose the elastic version (Kovari, 1969) has been used;
        this is equally applicable to the analysis of a ewtonian liquid because there is a complete
        analogy between the elastic stress-strain relations and the linear viscous stress-strain-rate
        relations. In this application the shear modulus is replaced by a viscosity which was arbitrarily
        assumed to be TJ = 2.273 X 10 13 Pa s (= 7.208 bar a). This particular assumption does not
        affect the calculated stress field, but only the scale of the velocity vectors.


        BOUNDAR Y CONDITIONS

        (a) Lower boundary
            The ice at point Pi on the ice-rock interface moves parallel to the interface; in the finite -
        element approximation this direction was specified to be parallel to the line connecting the
        two neighbouring nodal points Pi - I and P t + 1 on the interface. (Vice versa, the movement
        of a nodal point, calculated by the program, was considered to be parallel to the interface,
        if the same condition was satisfied.)

                        412                                          JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY

                           Where the ice sole was supported by water of a given pressure, the corresponding force
                        per unit width at a nodal point Pi was calculated as

                                                                                Fi = O.5Pwibi.
                        Here pwi is the water pressure at the depth of the point Pi and bi is the distance between two
                        neighbouring nodal points P i - I and Pi + I on the interface. Because of the cantilever effect
                        mentioned above, the extent of the area on which a given water pressure can act is not known
                        exactly at the beginning. Therefore, after running the program, it was necessary to make
                        sure that the points on the edges of the separated zone did not move downward into the bed
                        but parallel to the interface or upward. On the other hand, the pressure calculated by the
                        program for a point remaining on the assumed ice- rock interface ought to be larger than
                        the given water pressure; if this was not the case the extent of the ice-water interface was
                        changed and the program was run again.


                         (b) Upper boundary
                            Normal stress Ps and shear stress TS on the upper boundary result from the weight of the
                        ice layer on top of the modelled section. In a real glacier the drag of the valley sides reduces
                        the shear stress. In order to account approximately for this reduction a shape factor f = 0.5
                        has been assumed in the calculation of TS.
                            Thus
                                                                   TS   = fpg!:!.h cos ex sin IX = 0.875 bar
                        and

                                                                  Ps = pg!:!.h cos 2 ex = 25.0 bar
                        where !:!.h = 285 m and IX = 4 0 (see Fig. 2). p is the density of the ice and g the acceleration
                        due to gravity.
                           Components of the force acting at a nodal point Pi on the upper boundary are
                                                                        Fxi = Tsbi (unit width) f2
                                                                        Fzi = Psbi (unit width) f2
                        where bi is the distance between the two neighbouring points P i - I and Pi + I on the boundary.


                         (c) Sides of the modelled section
                               Since the stresses vary in a non-linear way along the sides of the section, the force com-
                         ponents in a nodal Pi were calculated from the stresses at the three successive points Pi- ll Pi,
                         and Pi+! on the boundary according to an interpolation formula commonly used in statics.
                         The stresses on the lateral faces were, however, not known at the beginning and had to be
                         determined by means of an iteration. In the first step these stresses were tentatively assumed
                         to be equal to those on a vertical cut in a plane-parallel inclined slab of ice which is frozen to
                         the bed. On this assumption, stresses in the interior of the modelled section were computed,
                         from which the boundary stresses for the second iteration step were deduced as follows:
                         Consider a line parallel to the x-axis which is drawn through a nodal point Pi on the left side
                         of the section. The points on this line at distances A, 2,x, and 3 A from Pi are labelled Pill Ph,
                         and Pi3 . The arithmetic mean of the stresses in PiI and P i2 was assigned to the boundary
                         point Pi. The same mean stresses but with opposite sign were allocated to the boundary point
                         P t3 . If the iteration were continued entirely in this way a possible superimposed longitudinal

      stress could not be eliminated. Therefore the arithmetic mean of computed velocities in Pil
      and Piz was prescribed at Pi (and Pi3 ) in every second step. The iteration was continued until
      the velocity did not vary along the upper boundary by more than 3.5 %.


      A PROBLEM IN MODELLING WATER-FILLED CAVITIES
           Let nodal points situated on the bedrock profile be labelled PI> Pz, P3 , ••.• Points on the
       ceiling of a cavity are marked with a star. The point Pi (_ Pi*) at the corner of a cavity
       (Fig. 3) is in contact with the bed and should move parallel to the original bed, that is parallel
       to the line connecting Pi-I and Pi+ l . In accordance with the specification given above,
       however, the point moves parallel to the line connecting the points Pi_l* and P i + 1" (Disregard
       of the specification would imply that forces act on a surface which is not closed.) Calculations
       carried out for various positions of point Pi- I* showed that the overall sliding velocity depends
       nearly linearly on the direction of movement of the point Pi. The dependency is negligible for
       small cavities but very strong for large ones. For example, in the case of the largest cavity
       modelled (Fig. 6b) a variation of the direction of movement of point Pt by 10 caused a change
       of the sliding velocity by 16 % at a water pressure close to the steady-state value. The difficulty
       is avoided to a large extent by putting Pi - I * approximately on the bedrock surface at a very
       small distance from Pi. A change of the distance between P i - I * and Pt affects the sliding
       velocity very little. In the case already quoted, an increase of this distance by 33 % caused a
       change of the sliding velocity by 1.2 % only. Some uncertainty, however, remains. Indeed,
       not even the "slope of the original bed" is well defined in the finite-element approximation if
       distances of nodal points are varied. The tolerances shown in the final plot of sliding velocities
        (Fig. 8) refer to the uncertainty.

       MODELLING OF STEADY CAVITIES

           These are cavities which are neither shrinking nor expanding at the given water pressure;
       at the cavity ceiling the ice moves parallel to it, the sliding velocity does not change with time
       as long as the water pressure is constant.
           The appropriate cavity geometry was found by a trial-and-error approach, an arbitrary
       shape was assumed at first. Running the finite-element program with boundary conditions
       corresponding to this cavity shape revealed that a cavity was shrinking in some places and
       expanding in others. Accordingly, nodal points of the cavity ceiling were put into slightly
       different positions in the next iteration (e.g. the cavity was made wider where it had been
       expanding). This procedure was continued until nodal points of the cavity ceiling moved
       (approximately) parallel to the ceiling.

                        cavities which have almost grown to their steady size, in Figure 6b larger cavities are shrinking
                        at the given water pressure. Their shape was derived for steady conditions with the water
                        pressure at 24.4 bar. In Figure 7 the water pressure is reduced to 23.6 bar; the cavities are
                        the same as in Figure 6a. This small pressure drop causes the ice initially to slide backwards.
                            The actual sliding velocity had to be derived in an additional computation from the
                        velocity at a sufficient height above the bed, in the present case the velocity on top of the
                        modelled section was used. From this velocity the proportion due to internal shear in the ice
                        below was subtracted. The sliding velocity obtained in this way for the nearly sinusoidal bed
                        is 12 % less than the theoretical value deduced for an exactly sinusoidal bed (e.g. ye, 1969).
                        The main reason for this disagreement appears to be that the modelled undulations have a
                        relatively large roughness a/A while the quoted theory is strictly valid for beds with small
                        roughness only. The present result agrees well with a theoretical prediction by Raymond,
                        which allows for the actual roughness (c. F. Raymond, personal communication).
                            In Figure 8 the x-components of sliding velocities are plotted against water pressure for the
                        different shapes of lee faces considered in the models: Curve I refers to the geometry of Figure
                        4a, Curve 11 refers to the nearly sinusoidal bed (Fig. 4b), lines III and IV represent sliding
                        with the cavities shown on Figure 6a and b . The horizontal branch III depicts the sliding
                        velocity when the cavity ceiling in Figure 6a is replaced by bedrock. The dotted line gives the
                        steady-state sliding velocities; i.e. the sliding velocities when steady cavities have formed.
                        Below this line cavities are shrinking.
                            From the examples in Figures 4 to 7 and from the diagram in Figure 8 the following trends
                        are apparent:
                                The smoother the ice-sole profile, the larger the sliding velocity (the velocity increases
                            in the sequence of Figures 3a, 3b, and 6a). This is what one would expect.
                                When a given water pressure is applied, the resulting increase in the sliding velocity is
                            the larger, the steeper the ice sole at the lee side of humps or, more specifically, the smaller
                            the separation pressure of the particular bed. Indeed, not only is the velocity increase
                            larger when the ice sole at the lee faces is steeper, but also the absolute magnitude of the
                            sliding velocity becomes larger provided that the water pressure is sufficiently large. This
                            effect would be much more marked if actual roches moutonnees were considered rather than
                            the modelled smooth glacier beds. (Of course, when the water pressure becomes so large
                            that spontaneous separation reaches a point on the common stoss face, the differences
                            between the sliding velocities on beds with different lee faces disappear. )
                                 Th~ response of the sliding velocity to a change of water pressure is the more sensitive
                             the larger the area of the ice sole which is subjected to the imposed water pressure. This is
                            evident from the slopes of the velocity-pressure curves in Figure 8. A closer inspection,
                            however, shows that it is not simply the size of the area subjected to the water pressure

             which determines the slope of the velocity- pressure function, but the orientation of this
             area is also influential.
                 The sliding velocity varies linearly with the water pressure as long as the area of the
             ice sole which is subjected to the imposed water pressure is constant. The relationship
             is of the form
                                                                                                      (5)
             where u(Pw) is the transient sliding velocity at a water pressure pw, Ust is the steady-state
             sliding velocity for the given cavity size, p st is the water pressure at which the considered
             cavity is steady, and C is a constant which depends on size and orientation of the area
             covered by the cavity and on the geometry of the remaining contact area. Numerical
             values ef Care: 64 for line III (Fig. 8) and 5 I for line IV.
            In the finite-element model the area of spontaneous separation of the ice sole increases in
        finite steps with increasing water pressure, therefore curves I and 11 consist of finite sections
        of straight lines. Once cavities have formed, a further increase of water pressure does not
        cause an additional spontaneous separation, but only slow cavity growth-as long as the
        pressure increase is not very large. Therefore, the sliding velocity is approximately given by
        Equation (5) during a finite period of time.

        DISCUSSION
           Considering the effect of a water pressure pw, acting on the ice sole at the lee sides of bed rock
        obstacles, different phases have been distinguished:

                            (I) transient phases
                                     (a) instantaneous separation, which is in our terminology the instantaneous
                                          re-distribution of pressure by the action of the water pressure PW;
                                     (b ) various stages of growing or shrinking cavi ties;
                            (2) steady-state sliding over cavities which are steady at the given water pressure.
                            First a remark is due concerning the extent and effect of instantaneous separation. It
                       has already been mentioned that the separated zone is larger than that part of the ice sole
                       which had originally been subjected to a normal pressure ~ pw. In other words, when
                       separation takes place, the pressure on the central, steep part of the separated ice sole is
                       increased while it is decreased along the edges of the separated zone. At first sight it may
                       therefore appear that no net force change at the lee faces is accomplished by the action of the
                       water. This is, however, not so since the separated zone is curved. Therefore, at the instant
                       of separation, the positive and negative pressure changes at the ice sole correspond to force
                       changes which do not compensate. Indeed, the action of the water pressure causes a net
                       increase of the force exerted on the ice in the x-direction, in contrast to a slight decrease in the
                       z-direction. The increase of force in the x-direction causes an equivalent increase of pressure
                       on the stoss face. This effect could also have been caused by an increase of the basal shear
                       stress. In either case the sliding velocity increases-linearly with the driving force when the
                       flow law is linear.
                            It has been seen that the effect of a water pressure pw on the sliding velocity is largest at the
                       instant of separation and then gradually decreases until steady cavities have formed. It is
                       informative to compare the distribution of forces on the ice sole in the different cases; for
                       illustration a particularly simplified bed will be considered. In Figure ga the mean normal
                       stress on face a z and on face a 4 is equal to Po, the ice overburden pressure. The mean normal
                       stresses on faces a, and a 3 are p, = Po- t1p and P3 = Po+ t1p, respectively, where the magni-
                       tude of t1p depends on the basal shear stress. If a water pressure pw > p, separates the ice
                       from the faces a, and exerts an additional force on the ice sole, the stress on a 3 increases to
                       p/ = (Pw-p, ) + P3' Figure gc shows the situation when cavities have grown under the
                       influence of the water pressure Pw. The mean stress on faces a 3 is still p/. The stress on a z,
                       however, is reduced to pw while the stress on a 4 is increased to p/ = (pOa4 (Po-Pw) az ) /a4 •              +
                       It is only this re-distribution of pressure on troughs and crests which causes the differences in
                       sliding velocity at the beginning of cavity growth and when steady cavities have formed. The
                       larger pressure in the wave troughs during the phase of cavity growth permits flow along

                                              SLIDING       VELOCITIES           OF    GLACIERS

       straighter flow lines, i.e. a nearly rigid movement of a part of the basal ice. Therefore the
       sliding velocity is larger than in the steady-state. This is generally valid and illustrated in
       Figures 5 and 6.
           The present results have been obtained on the basis of very simplistic assumptions. More
       realistic assumptions would change the results in the following ways:

             I.The introduction of a tangential stress at the ice-bed contact, for instance a Coulomb
               friction law, has an effect similar to that of a reduction of the basal shear stress. Both
               the separation pressure (Equation ( I) ) and the limiting water pressure (Equation (3))
               attain larger values. The difference in sliding velocities at the commencement of cavity
               growth and with steady cavities is reduced since in the latter case the contact area is
               smaller and so is the friction.
            2. If the linear flow law is replaced by Glen's law the difference between the transient and
               steady-state sliding velocity becomes larger presumably, because, when cavities begin
               to grow, ice deformation is more strongly concentrated in zones at the stoss faces than
               it would be in the steady-state giving a particularly small effective viscosity there
               of 7Je = tAn/Ten-I. Here Te = (crt/crt/ /2)i is the effective shear stress and A and n
               are constants in Glen's flow law: Etj = Ten-IrJt/ /A'TI. Furthermore, the straight lines
               in Figure 8 are replaced by parabolas.
            3. If, instead of periodic bed undulations, geometrically similar undulations with different
               wavelengths are assumed, the basal shear stress is no longer uniformly distributed
               amongst the different wavelengths; in order to maintain a uniform sliding velocity the
               smaller undulations require a larger proportion of the mean basal shear stress. There-
               fore, separation starts at the smaller obstacles at a smaller water pressure. Nevertheless,
               instability is attained no sooner than when the water pressure rises to the same limiting
               water pressure as in the case of periodic bed undulations. If the stoss faces of bed
               undulations have different maximum slopes, a rigid-body translation is only possible in
               the direction of the steepest stoss face which therefore determines the limiting water
               pressure for stability. Of course, if steep stoss faces are few, stress concentrations are
               immense when the limiting water pressure is approached. Consequently sliding is very
               fast and ice fracturing may occur.
            4. In reality, not all low-pressure zones at lee faces are in communication with subglacial
               drainage channels as has been assumed. For this reason the computed effect of the
               subglacial water pressure is an upper bound to the true effect which depends strongly
               on the degree of branching of the subglacial drainage system of a particular glacier in a
               certain season. Furthermore, the capacity of water flow towards the low-pressure zones
               is not unrestricted. If the water pressure rises to the limiting pressure the sliding
               velocity is limited by the rate of water input into the subglacial cavity network.
            5. The contribution of regelation sliding to the total sliding velocity is negligible for the
               size of undulations modelled. However, the possibility that freezing of the ice sole
               occurs in zones where the pressure is temporarily reduced as a consequence of water-
               pressure variations cannot be dismissed. This mechanism has been discussed by Robin
               (1976). It is beyond the scope of the present paper to investigate its effect on the
               variations of the sliding velocity in more detail. I t is noted, however, that some field
               observations indicate that the freezing mechanism is not influential enough to obscure
               variations of the sliding velocity which are consistent with the present model. The
               largest temporary pressure reduction takes place at the crests of bedrock obstacles at the
               time of rising water pressure in the cavities. One would therefore expect the most
               extensive refreezing of the ice sole to the bed (and consequently a small sliding velocity)
               in this time. Measured sliding velocities, however, were largest during the time of
               maximum or rising water pressure in moulins (I ken, 1974, pp. 90, 94, and 96).

                       CONCLUSIONS

                          The study of the idealized model has made characteristic features of the relation of
                      subglacial water pressure and sliding velocity distinct. The sliding velocity is neither simply a
                      function of the subglacial water pressure nor of the size of cavities but depends on both
                      variables. The result that the largest sliding velocity (in the stable range) occurs at the
                      beginning of cavity growth and not when the steady-state size of cavitation is attained may
                      correspond to the field observation that the maximum horizontal velocity occurs bifore the
                      upward motion of the ice has reached the maximum elevation. * Backward sliding, predicted
                      by the model for the case of rapidly shrinking cavities, has not yet been observed. It would be
                      an indication of the significance of the cavitation mechanism. For this test short-term velocity
                      measurements ought to be continued during the night. Depending on the type of glacier and
                      subglacial drainage system it may, however, happen that the channels which interconnect the
                      cavities become blocked, when the water pressure drops and thus the shrinking process is
                      stopped.
                          Of particular interest is the possibility of unstable sliding at a water pressure well below the
                      ice overburden pressure. The very high velocities observed during brief periods at the
                      beginning of the melt season may possibly be interpreted as short spells of locally unstable
                      sliding, terminated by the loss of water from the subglacial system.
