(1) transient phases
(a) instantaneous scparation, which is in our terminology the instantancous
re-distribution of pressure by the action of the water pressure pyw;
(b) various stages of growing or shrinking cavitics;

(2) steady-state sliding over cavities which arc steady at the given water pressure.

First a remark is due concerning the extent and effect of instantaneous separation. It
has alrcady been mentioned that the separated zone is larger than that part of the ice sole
which had originally been subjected to a normal pressure < py. In other words, when
separation takes place, the pressure on the central, steep part of the separated ice sole is
increased while it is decrcased along the edges of the separated zone. At first sight it may
therefore appear that no net force change at the lee faces is accomplished by the action of the
water. This is, however, not so since the separated zone is curved. Therefore, at the instant
of separation, the positive and negative pressurc changes at the ice sole correspond to force
changes which do not compensate. Indeed, the action of the water pressurc causes a net
increase of the force exerted on the ice in the x-direction, in contrast to a slight decrease in the
s-dircction. The incrcase of force in the x-direction causes an equivalent increase of pressure
on the stoss face. This effect could also have been caused by an increase of the basal shear
stress. In either case the sliding velocity increases—linearly with the driving force when the
flow law is linear.

It has been seen that the effect of a water pressurc py on the sliding velocity is largest at the
instant of separation and then gradually decreases until steady cavities have formed. Tt is
informative to compare the distribution of forces on the ice sole in the different cases; for
illustration a particularly simplified bed will be considered. In Figure ga the mean normal
stress on face a, and on face a, is equal 10 p,, the ice overburden pressure. The mean normal
stresses on faces a, and a, are p, = p,—Ap and p; = po-+ Ap, respectively, where the magni-
tude of Ap depends on the basal shear stress. If a water pressure py = p, separates the ice
from the faces a, and exerts an additional force on the ice sole, the stress on a; increases to
by = (pw—po) —py Figure ge shows the situation when cavities have grown under the
influence of the water pressure py. The mean stress on faces ayis still py'. "The stress on a,,
however, is reduced to py while the stress on ay is increased to p," = (poa, (po—pw) az)/a,.
Itis only this re-distribution of pressure on troughs and crests which causes the differences in
sliding velocity at the beginning of cavity growth and when steady cavitics have formed. The
larger pressure in the wave troughs during the phase of cavity growth permits flow along
