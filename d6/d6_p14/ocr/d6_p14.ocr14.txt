CONCLUSIONS
The study of the idealized model has made characteristic features of the relation of

subglacial water pressure and sliding velocity distinet. The sliding velocity is neither simply a
function of the subglacial water pressure nor of the size of cavities but depends on both
variables. The result that the largest sliding velocity (in the stable range) occurs at the
beginning of cavity growth and not when the steady-state size of cavitation is attained may
correspond to the field observation that the maximum horizontal velocity occurs before the
upward motion of the ice has reached the maximum elevation.* Backward sliding, predicted
by the model for the case of rapidly shrinking cavities, has not yet been observed. 1t would be
an indication of the significance of the cavitation mechanism. For this test short-term velocity
measurements ought to be continued during the night. Depending on the type of glacier and
subglacial drainage system it may. however, happen that the channels which interconnect the
cavities become blocked, when the water pressure drops and thus the shrinking process is
stopped.

Of particular interest is the possibility of unstable sliding at a water pressure well below the
ice overburden pressure. The very high velocities observed during brief” periods at the
beginning of the melt season may possibly be interpreted as short spells of locally unstable
sliding, terminated by the loss of water from the subglacial system.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This study has gained much from the discussions with C.. F. Raymond and H. Réthlisberger

who took a particular interest in the problem and helped to clarify the concepts. They also

read the manuscript and suggested improvements. U, Spring, K. Hutter, and G. Raggio also
participated in some of the discussions. P. Fritz of the Institut far Strassen-, Fels-, und

Eisenbahnbau of Eidg. Technische Hochschule (ISETH) advised on the use of the finite-

clement program STAUB. 'The drawings were prepared by B. Nedela and S, Dimmler

typed the manuscript.
