of the liquid. Further, the equations apply also to three-dimensionally rough beds if the
projection of the total arca exposed 1o the water pressure on a plane which is normal to the
direction 8 is the same as in the two-dimensional case.

For the special case of a sinusoidal bed the steepest tangent of the stoss face is

(tan f) ., = 2malA,
and thus
P = po—A7/(2ma). (3)

In the formulation of the overall force balance the material properties of the glacier are
irrelevant. However, there are differences in the pressure disribution and size of’ contact
areas when the glacier is assumed to be viscous rather than rigid. When the water pressure
rises to the limiting value, a rigid body on an undulating (e.g. sinusoidal) bed is in contact with
the bed only at the inflexion points of the stoss faces. A viscous body, however, touches the
bed on finite arcas so that extreme stress concentrations are avoided. Consequences of this
difference will not be pursued further in this paper.

A stability limit for sliding under the action of a water pressure has already been derived
by Lliboutry in a different way. For the case of a sinusoidal bed he has found a maximum,
limiting value of the reduced friction /i [/, of 1.525 (Lliboutry, 1968, p. 34). This value refers
to a maximum size of stable cavities, they cover one-half of the sinusoidal bed. By definition
fw = 7and f, — im(2a/\)( p,—pw), hence Lliboutry’s limiting value of the water pressure 1s

po—A7/(1.325ma). (4)
This value is smaller than that derived above (Equation (3)). The difference may result
from Lliboutry’s assumption of a symmetric pressure distribution on a (large) contact area,
which has its centre well above the inflexion point of the stoss face (Lliboutry, 1968, p. 33).

The remaining part of this paper deals with water pressures below the limiting pressure
which correspond to the stable range of sliding velocities. Before discussion of the numerical
analysis, the effect of a water pressure which is in the range between the separation pressure
and the limiting water pressure will be described in a qualitative manner.

When water at the pressure py in this range penetrates to the lee faces of the protuberances
of the glacier bed, a part of the ice sole is subjected to the boundary pressurce py and is thus
separated immediately from the bed, a separation which includes not only that part where
the normal siress had originally been smaller than gy but a larger zone as a result of a canti-
lever effect. In the subsequent process of cavity growth, the ice in the central part of the
separated zone no longer moves paralicel to the bed but away from it. The lower edge of the
separated zone moves further along the bed while the upper edge retreats only a litde from its
original position. ‘Thus, the extent of that part of the ice sole which is supported by water
at the pressure py becomes much larger in the course of time. When the cavity has grown to
its final, steady form the ice at the ceiling moves parallel to it.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE NUMERICAL MODEL

The present analysis is based on several assumptions:

1. No tangential stresses at the ice—bed interface.

2. A linear flow law for the ice. The ice is taken to be nearly incompressible in time ; more
specifically, that parameter which is the linear viscous analogue of Poisson’s ratio in
clasticity is assigned the numerical value 0.499. Perfectincompressibility in time would
require the numerical value 0.5, which is not acceptable for the finite-element program.

3. Plane-strain, periodic bed undulations in the xz plane.

4. Instantsupply or drainage of water of a given pressure at all lee faces of the undulating
bed.

5. No regelation.
