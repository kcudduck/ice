Where the ice sole was supported by water of a given pressure, the corresponding force
per unit width at a nodal point P; was calculated as
F; = o.5pwibi.
Here py; is the water pressure at the depth of the point Py and by is the distance between two
neighbouring nodal points P; ; and P;; on the interface. Because of the cantilever effect
mentioned above, the extent of the area on which a given water pressure can act is not known
exactly at the beginning. Thercfore, after running the program, it was necessary to make
sure that the points on the edges of the separated zone did not move downward into the bed
but parallel to the interface or upward. On the other hand, the pressure calculated by the
program for a point remaining on the assumed ice rock interface ought to be larger than
the given water pressure; if this was not the case the extent of the ice-water interface was
changed and the program was run again.
(b) Upper boundary
Normal stress p and shear stress 7. on the upper boundary result from the weight of the
ice layer on top of the modelled section. In a real glacier the drag of the valley sides reduces
the shear stress. In order to account approximately for this reduction a shape factor f = 0.5
has been assumed in the calculation of 74.
Thus
75 = [pgAh cos = sin « = 0.875 bar
and
ps = pgAh cos?a — 25.0 bar
where Ak — 285 m and « — 4° (sce Fig. 2). p is the density of the ice and ¢ the acceleration
due to gravity.
Components of the force acting at a nodal point P; on the upper boundary are
Fpi = 7sb; (unit width)/2
Fai — psb; (unit width)/2

where b; is the distance between the two neighbouring points P; ; and Py, on the boundary.
(c) Sides of the modelled section
Since the stresses vary in a non-lincar way along the sides of the section, the force com-
ponents in a nodal P; were calculated from the stresses at the three successive points Py, Py,
and P;, on the boundary according to an interpolation formula commonly used in statics.
The stresses on the lateral faces were, however, not known at the beginning and had to be
determined by means of an iteration. In the first step these stresses were tentatively assumed
to be equal to those on a vertical cut in a plane-parallel inclined slab of ice which is frozen to
the bed. On this assumption, stresses in the interior of the modelled section were computed,
from which the boundary stresses for the second iteration step were deduced as follows:
Consider a line parallel to the y-axis which is drawn through a nodal point £; on the left side
of the section. The points on this line at distances A, 2, and 3 from P; are labelled Py, Py,
and P;,. ‘The arithmetic mean of the stresses in Py and P, was assigned to the boundary
point P;. The same mean stresses but with opposite sign were allocated to the boundary point
P;,. If the iteration were continued entirely in this way a possible superimposed Tongitudinal
