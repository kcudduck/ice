cavities which have almost grown to their steady size, in Figure 6b larger cavities are shrinking
at the given water pressure. Their shape was derived for steady conditions with the water
pressure at 24.4 bar. In Figure 7 the water pressure is reduced to 23.6 bar; the cavites are
the same as in Figure 6a. ‘T'his small pressure drop causes the ice initially to slide backwards.

The actual sliding velocity had to be derived in an additional computation from the
velocity at a sufficient height above the bed, in the present case the velocity on top of the
modelled section was used. From this velocity the proportion due to internal shear in the ice
below was subtracted. The sliding velocity obtained in this way for the nearly sinusoidal bed
is 129, less than the theoretical value deduced for an exactly sinusoidal bed (e.g. Nye, 1g6g).
The main reason for this disagreement appears to be that the modelled undulations have a
relatively large roughness a/A while the quoted theory is strictly valid for beds with small
roughness only. The present result agrees well with a theoretical prediction by Raymond,
which allows for the actual roughness (C. F. Raymond, personal communication).

Tn Figure 8 the x-components of sliding velocities are plotted against water pressure for the
different shapes of lee faces considered in the models: Curve [ refers to the geomenry of Figure
4a, Curve II refers to the nearly sinusoidal bed (Fig. 4b), lines ITT and IV represent sliding
with the cavities shown on Figure 6a and b. The horizontal branch TIT depicts the sliding
velocity when the cavity ceiling in Figure 6a is replaced by bedrock. The dotted line gives the
steady-state sliding velocities; i.e. the sliding velocities when steady cavities have formed.
Below this line cavities are shrinking.

From the examples in Figures 4 to 7 and from the diagram in Iigure 8 the following trends
are apparent:

The smoother the ice-sole profile, the larger the sliding velocity (the velocity increases
in the sequence of Figures 3a, 3b, and 6a). This is what one would expect.

When a given water pressure is applied, the resulting increase in the sliding velocity is
the larger, the steeper the ice sole at the lee side of humps or, more specifically, the smaller
the separation pressure of the particular bed. Indeed, not only is the velocity increase
larger when the ice sole at the lee faces is steeper, but also the absolute magnitude of the
sliding velocity becomes larger provided that the water pressure is sulliciently large. This
effect would be much more marked if actual roches moutonnées were considered rather than
the modelled smooth glacier beds. (Of course, when the water pressure becomes so large
that spontaneous separation reaches a point on the common stoss face, the differences
between the sliding velocities on beds with different lee faces disappear.)

"I'he response of the sliding velocity to a change of water pressurce is the more sensitive
the Targer the area of the ice sole which is subjected to the imposed water pressure. This is
evident from the slopes of the velocity—pressure curves in Figure 8. A closer inspection,
however, shows that it is not simply the size of the area subjected to the water pressure
