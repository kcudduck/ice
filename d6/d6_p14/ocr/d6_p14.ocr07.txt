SLIDING VELOCITIES OF GLACIERS 413
stress could not be eliminated. Therefore the arithmetic mean of computed velocities in Py,
and P;, was prescribed at £ (and P;;) in every second step. The iteration was continued until
the velocity did not vary along the upper boundary by more than 3.59,.

A PROBLEM IN MODELLING WATER-FILLED CAVITIES

Let nodal points situated on the bedrock profile be labelled P,. P, Py, ... Points on the

ceiling of a cavity are marked with a star. The point P; (- P;*) at the corner of a cavity
(Fig. g) is in contact with the bed and should move parallel to the original bed, that is parallel
to the line connecting P;_; and P;,,. In accordance with the specification given above,
however, the point moves parallel to the line connecting the points P;_ *and P; ;. (Disregard
of the specification would imply that forces act on a surface which is not closed.) Calculations
carried out for various positions of point P; * showed that the overall sliding velocity depends
nearly linearly on the direction of movement of the point 2. The dependency is negligible for
small cavities but very strong for large ones. For example, in the case of the largest cavity
modelled (Fig. 6b) a variation of the direction of movement of point P; by 1” caused a change
of the sliding velocity by 167, at a water pressure close (o the steady-state value. The difficulty
is avoided to a large extent by putting P; * approximately on the bedrock surface at a very
small distance from P;. A change of the distance between 72 *and P; affects the sliding
velocity very little. In the casc already quoted, an increase of this distance by 359 caused a
change of the sliding velocity by 1.29, only. Some uncertainty, however, remains. Indeed,
not even the “slope of the original bed™ is well defined in the finite-clement approximation if
distances of nodal points are varied. The tolerances shown in the final plot of sliding velocities
(Fig. 8) refer to the uncertainty.

MODELLING OF STEADY CAVITIES

These are cavities which are neither shrinking nor expanding at the given water pressure;
at the cavity ceiling the ice moves parallel to it the sliding velocity does not change with time
as long as the water pressure is constant.

The appropriate cavity geometry was found by a trial-and-crror approach, an arbitrary
shape was assumed at first.  Running the finite-clement program with boundary conditions
corresponding to this cavity shape revealed that a cavity was shrinking in some places and
expanding in others. Accordingly, nodal points of the cavity ceiling were put into slightly
different positions in the next iteration (e.g. the cavity was made wider where it had been
expanding). This procedure was continued until nodal points of the cavity ceiling moved
(approximately) parallel to the ceiling.
