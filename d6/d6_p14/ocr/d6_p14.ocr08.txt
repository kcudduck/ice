The flow on a nearly sinusoidal bed was modelled as a reference. Then the shape of the
lee faces was modified while the shape of the stoss faces and the periodicity were held un-
changed in all cases studied. "The velocity fields on the nearly sinusoidal bed and on a bed
with steeper lee faces are shown in Figure 4h and a. Figures 5a to 6b illustrate the eflect of
water pressurc py — 24.1 bar. In Figure 5a and b the stage at which cavity growth begins
on the beds of Figure 4a and b is shown. Figure 6a represents the sliding over water-filled
