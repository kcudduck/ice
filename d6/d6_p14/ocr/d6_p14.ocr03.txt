Fig. 1. Diagram illustrating the derivation of the limiting water pressure of stability. An ice slab of thickness d is resting on a
stepped bed with a mean slope «.

Asimple derivation is as follows: Consider a planc-parallel slab of thickness d and of large
lateral extent resting on a lubricated, undulating bed with a mean slope . For a moment we
will assume a particularly simple shape of the hed: a bed consisting of rectangular steps (Fig.
1). Anice column of unit width and length [ rests on the faces b and ¢ of the steps, its weight
is I'y = pgdl. The component perpendicular to face b is

Fiy = pgdl cos(B—u)
and the component perpendicular to face ¢ is

Fo = pgdl sin(p - o)
where pis the density of the (ice) slab, g the acceleration due to gravity, g the angle which
the stoss faces make with the down-slope direction v (Fig. 1), and B = the angle between
the stoss faces and the horizontal, i.e. the backward inclination of the steps.

The corresponding mean pressures on faces b and ¢ are

and

pe = Fele — pgd ———— .

Thus, if a water pressure py - pe opposes pe there will be a net force on the ice which will
move it upward along faces b with accelerating velocity, The limiting pressure pe will in the
following be designated py.
Lquivalent expression for gy are:

The ice overburden pressure is p, = pgd cos « and 7 - pod sin » is the basal shear stress.
The last expression in Equation (2) is also appropriate if the basal shear stress is given by the
more general expression 7 — fped sin o where fis a shape factor taking into account the drag
of the valley sides. The validity of LEquation (2) is not restricted to a bed consisting of
rectangular steps; the equations hold for other two-dimensional bhed undulations as well if the
steepest tangents on the stoss faces make an angle g with the mean bed slope, This is readily
scen if one assumes that the spaces between the stepped bed and another bed, for example the
one which is sketched on the right of Figure 1, arve filled with a weightless liquid.  Inserting
the liquid does not aflect the balance of forces and the pressure is constant over the surface
