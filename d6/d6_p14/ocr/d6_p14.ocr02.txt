Change of thickness of the lubricating water film between ice and bedrock (Weertman,

1962).
Deformation of saturated sediments below a glacier (Boulton, 1979: Jones, 1979).
Participation of subsole drift in the sliding process (Engelhardt and others, 1978;
Kamb and others, 1979; Boulton and others, 1979).

Slip along water-activated shear planes within a glacier (Tyulina, 1976).
If the velocity variations are indeed caused by short-term water-pressure variations which are
synchronous over large arcas of the glacier bed, then high permeability of the subglacial
drainage system is an essential assumption. This requirement is best satisfied if bed separation
is extensive. Extensive bed separation also provides an appropriate explanation for the
variations of vertical velocity which may then be understood as the result of simultancous
growth (or shrinkage) of subglacial, communicating cavities. It thus appears probable that
the velocity variations in the quoted field examples were a direct consequence of sliding over an
undulating bed with bed separation conwolled by a varying subglacial water pressure.
Certainly, other mechanisms may have played a part: in particular, friction between rock
particles in the ice sole and below has probably modified the observed variations of the sliding
velocity. The present paper will be confined, however, to an understanding of the principles.
It concentrates on the idealized problem of sliding on a perfectly lTubricated bed with the
action of an imposed water pressure. To a large part this problem is well known, owing to the
comprchensive sliding theories of Kamb (1970) and Lliboutry 1968, 1979). The pioncering
ideas on the action of the subglacial water pressure were developed in the original work of
Lliboutry, yet the transient stages of cavity growth and shrinkage have not been analysed so
far. It is exactly these phases, however, which seem to determine the velocity variations in
question.
FUNDAMENTAT CONSIDERATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF THE SUBGLACIAL WATER PRESSURE ACTING ON

A GLACIER SOLE WITH NON-UNIFORM PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION

Tn the absence of a basal shear stress the pressure which the ice exerts on its bed is every-
where p,, the ice overburden pressure. If. however, the basal shear stress is not zero, the
pressurc on the bed is no longer uniform, but is larger than p, on the stoss faces of bedrock
protuberances and smaller on the lee faces, so that equilibrium of forces is maintained. It is
in the low-pressure zones at the lee faces where a change of water pressure caused by, say, a
change of water input into the subglacial drainage system can aflect motion of the glacier even
if the water pressure stays well below the ice overburden pressure. I'he lower bound of water
pressure which has an effect is the minimum pressure occurring at the lee faces, the separation
pressure. At a larger water pressure a part of the ice sole is separated from the bed. The
scparation pressure has been introduced and given in quantitative terms in the sliding theories
of Lliboutry (1968). Nye (196g), Kamb (1970), Morland (1976). and others. For the special
case of a sinusoidal bed the separation pressure py is

AT .
ps=ho (1)
where = is the basal shear stress, A the wavelength, and a the amplitude (one half of the
difference of the maximum and minimum of the sine function).

Another important paramcter is the limiting water pressure above which the sliding
becomes unstable, that is to say, a non-zero acceleration term enters into the balance of forces.
This pressure is well below the ice overburden pressure. C. I'. Raymond and H. Rothlisberger
(personal communications) have independently arrived at the prediction of this pressure and
have derived an explicit expression.
