Fig. 8. Plot of sliding velocity versus waler pressure. w is the x-component of the sliding velocity ; the index s refers to (steady-

state) sliding on the sinusoidal bed at the separation pressure. ulus is the x-component of the sliding velocity expressed as a

Sraction of the sliding velocity on the sinusoidal bed at the separation pressure. pn is the limiting water pressure at which

sliding becomes unstable. Curves I to IV show the initial, transient sliding velocity at the instant when the water pressure is

applied (except for the horizontal parts and two points on lines 1 and 1V which show steady-state sliding). Curve I refers
to sliding on the bed shown in Figure qa, curve 11 refers to the sinusoidal bed, lines 11T and 1V refer to sliding with the
water-filled cavities of Figures Ga and b, respectively. T he horizontal branch 111 depicts the sliding celocity when the cavity
ceiling in Figure 6 is replaced by bedyock. The dotted line marks steady-state sliding., below this line cavities are shrinking

(indicated by broken lincs).

which determines the slope of the velocity pressure function, but the orientation of this

arca is also influential.

The sliding velocity varies linearly with the water pressure as long as the area of the
ice sole which is subjected (o the imposed water pressure is constant, The relationship
is of the form

u(py) — ust[1+Clpw—pat) [pai] )
where u(py) is the transient sliding velocity at a water pressure py, ug is the steady-state
sliding velocity for the given cavity size, py is the water pressure at which the considered
cavity is steady, and (' is a constant which depends on size and orientation of the arca
covered by the cavity and on the geometry of the remaining contact arca. Numerical
values of Care: 64 for line 111 (Fig. 8) and 51 for line 1V,

In the finite-clement model the area of spontancous separation of the ice sole increases in
finite steps with increasing water pressure, therefore curves I and 1T consist of finite sections
of straight lines. Once cavities have formed, a further increase of water pressure does not
cause an additional spontancous separation, but only slow cavity growth—as long as the
pressure increase is not very large. Therefore, the sliding velocity is approximately given by
Equation (5) during a finite period of time.

Discusston

Considering the effect of a water pressure p, acting on the ice sole at the lee sides of bedrock

obstacles, different phases have been distinguished :
