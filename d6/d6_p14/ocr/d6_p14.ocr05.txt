SLIDING VELOGITIES OF GLACIERS 411
GEOMETRY OF THE MODEL
The finite-element analysis was applied to a section representing in two dimensions a small
part of a glacier at its base. This section (Fig. 2) was taken to be 25 m high and 60 m long.
It is resting on an unduladng bed which has a mean slope of 4°. The wavelength of the
undulations was chosen to be 20 m, the amplitude 1.5 m. This section is part of an infinitely-
wide ice mass which is 310 m thick (measured vertically in space) and has a surface- and bed-
slope of 47 Thickness and slope are the same as at the central part of the Unteraargletscher
where series of short-term movement measurements have been made.

METHOD OF NUMERICAT, ANALYSIS
The calculations were carried out with the finite-element program STAUB. This
computer program and a related plotting program were developed at the Institut fur
Strassen-, Fels-, und Eisenbahnbau, Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Zirich, for the
purpose of stress and strain analysis in tunnel construction work (Kovéri and others, 1976).
Different program versions for elastic and plastic materials and for substances with composite
properties exist. For the present purpose the elastic version (Kovari, 1969) has been used;
this is equally applicable o the analysis of a Newtonian liquid because there is a complete
analogy between the elastic stress-strain relations and the lincar viscous stress—strain-rate
relations. In thisapplication the shear modulus is replaced by a viscosity which was arbitrarily
assumed o be n - 2.273 <108 Pas (— 7.208 bara). This particular assumption does not
aflect the calculated stress field, but only the scale of the veloclty vectors.
BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
(a) Lower boundary
The ice at point £; on the ice-rock interface moves parallel to the interface; in the finite-
clement approximation this direction was specified o be parallel o the line connecting the
two neighbouring nodal points 2; | and 2, on the interface. (Viee versa, the movement
of a nodal point, calculated by the program, was considered to be parallel to the interface,
if the same condition was satisfied.)
