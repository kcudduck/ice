SLIDING VELOCITIES OF GLAGIERS 110
straighter flow lines, i.e. a nearly rigid movement of a part of the basal ice. Thercfore the
sliding velocity is larger than in the steady-state. This is generally valid and illustrated in
Figures 5 and 6.

The present results have been obtained on the basis of very simplistic assumptions. More

realistic assumptions would change the results in the following ways:

1. The introduction of a tangential stress at the ice~bed contact, for instance a Coulomb
friction law, has an eflect similar (o that of a reduction of the basal shear stress. Both
the separation pressure (Lquation (1)) and the limiting water pressure (Equation (3))
attain larger values. 'The difference in sliding velocities at the commencement of cavity
growth and with steady cavities is reduced since in the latter case the contact arca is
smaller and so is the friction.

2. If the linear flow law is replaced by Glen’s law the difference between the transient and
steady-state sliding velocity becomes larger presumably, because, when cavities begin
to grow, ice deformation is more strongly concentrated in zones at the stoss faces than
it would be in the steady-state giving a particularly small effective viscosity there
of e — YA /ren=1. Here 7o (5i5'5ij'/2)4 is the effective shear stress and A and »
are constants in Glen’s flow law: ¢ T 1oy’ /A, Furthermore, the straight lines
in Figure 8 are replaced by parabolas.

3. If; instead of periodic bed undulations, geometrically similar undulations with different
wavelengths are assumed, the basal shear stress is no longer uniformly distributed
amongst the different wavelengths: in order to maintain a uniform sliding velocity the
smaller undulations require a larger proportion of the mean basal shear stress. There-
fore, separation starts at the smaller obstacles at a smaller water pressure, Nevertheless,
instability is attained no sooner than when the water pressure rises to the same limiting
water pressure as in the case of periodic bed undulations. If the stoss faces of bed
undulations have different maximum slopes, a rigid-body translation is only possible in
the direction of the steepest stoss face which therefore determines the limiting water
pressure for stability. Of course, if steep stoss faces are few, stress concentrations are
immense when the limiting water pressure is approached. Consequently sliding is very
fast and ice fracturing may occur.

4. In reality, not all low-pressure zones at lee faces are in communication with subglacial
drainage channels as has been assumed. For this reason the computed effect of the
subglacial water pressure is an upper bound to the true effect which depends strongly
on the degree of branching of the subglacial drainage system of a particular glacier in a
certain scason. Furthermore, the capacity of water flow towards the low-pressure zones
is not unrestricted. If the water pressure rises to the limiting pressure the sliding
velocity is limited by the rate of water input into the subglacial cavity network.

5. The contribution of regelation sliding to the total sliding velocity is negligible for the
size of undulations modelled. However, the possibility that freezing of the ice sole
occurs in zones where the pressure is temporarily reduced as a consequence of water-
pressure variations cannot be dismissed. This mechanism has been discussed by Robin
(1976). It is beyond the scope of the present paper to investigate its effect on the
variations of the sliding velocity in more detail. Tt is noted, however, that some field
observations indicate that the freezing mechanism is not influential enough to obscure
variations of the sliding velocity which are consistent with the present model. The
largest temporary pressure reduction takes place at the crests of bedrock obstacles at the
time of rising water pressure in the cavities. One would therefore expect the most
extensive refreezing of the ice sole to the bed (and consequently a small sliding velocity)
in this time. Measured sliding velocities, however, were largest during the time of
maximum or rising water pressure in moulins (Iken, 1974, pp. 9o, 94, and g6).
