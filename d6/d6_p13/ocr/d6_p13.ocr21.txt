LIQUID AND GAS PHASES IN TEMPERATE GLAGIER ICE 233

In order to estimate p. we consider the average spacing s of bubbles along veins. 1t is reasonable to assume
that the probability of finding  single bubble touching a vein in a very shortlength interval is proportional to the
average number of hubbles per unit length of vein (1/s) and that the probability of finding more than one bubble
for such a short length interval is zevo. In this case the probability of finding £ bubbles on a link of length b is
given by Poisson’s formula. Tn particular the probability of no blockage or & — 0 is given by

11 was found that the sequence {Qu ) converges fairly rapidly. which is consistent with the obvious requirement
that when g does not depend on position, local connectedness of the network implies large-seale connectedness
as well. The topological model used in this caleulation neglects the fact that some of the paths lead back on
themselves and that some eross back over the reference plane. Because these complications should become most
important at the more distant levels of four-grain intersections and {Q, 1 converges fairly rapidly, the limit of the
sequence is probably a reasonable estimate of @ for the real network.
