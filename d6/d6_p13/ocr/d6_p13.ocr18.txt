penetrating surface water in roughly (¢/ei) < 10 d, where (¢/¢i) is the ratio of the effective heat

capacity to that of purc ice. This ratio depends upon the vein size (Appendix C) and the

presence of liquid outside the veins. Tt is therefore uncertain. but a value of 10 is reasonable.

The warming time is therefore 100 d. Given the large uncertainty in this time, a conduit

density of several per square meter (Section 6.2) is not necessarily incompatible with the

temperature.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to acknowledge the assistance given in the field by Professor E. R.

LaChapelle. David Bell, and Philip Tayvlor. Suzanne Cummings deserves special mention for
help in the field and many hours spent making textural measurements from photographs and
on samples in the cold room. The ULS. National Park Service gave permission for the field
work, and the principal financial support was [rom the National Science Foundation under
grant GA-28554. One of us (W.D.H.) also acknowledges the support of State of Alaska
funds.
