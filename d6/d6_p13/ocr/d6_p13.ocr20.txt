HEAT CONDUGTION INTO SAMPLE

If the fractional liquid-water content of a temperate ice sample is small, and if the liquid is confined to the

veins, the thermal diflusion equation is

The numerical solution of the diffusion equation with temperature-dependent heat capacity is straight-

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF BLOCKAGE OF VEINS BY BUBRBLES

Consider a unit area ol some reference plane. There are noveins crossing this arca. We want 1o know how
many of these veins can actually transport water.

Let p be the probability that any given network link represented by a segment of vein between two four-grain
intersections is not blocked by any bubbles (or other type of blockage . Then it is clear that only pr of the Tinks
crossing the unit area on the plane are unblocked. In addition, some of these pn unblocked links cannot transport
water because all of the paths leading to them from above or below the plane are blocked. Let Q(p) be the
probability that a given link crossing the plane is cut ofl from distant veins below the plane. In order to transport
water. the link must be connected to the vein network both above and below the reference surface. Therefore,
the effective number of veins crossing the surface is
