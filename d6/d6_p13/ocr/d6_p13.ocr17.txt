LIQUID AND GAS PHASES IN TEMPERATE GLACIER ICE 220
1), Yet deeper in the zone of foliated coarse ice, it is likely that the intergranular flux per
unit arca would be even smaller because of the much lower density of three-grain intersections
and the blockage of veins by bubbles ("Table I11).

Since only a small fraction of the daily melt water can penetrate below a depth of about
7 m on an intergranular scale, most of it must run laterally through the snow or the permeable
near-surface ice to cracks or conduits. The fact that conduit-like features were observed in the
small volume represented by the core and the fine scale of the branching (Section 3.4 suggests
that the density of conduits could be as high as several per square meter near the surface. .\
rough estimate of the water flow through such conduits suggests that a density of several 1o
several tens per square meter would be suflicient to transport all of the daily melt. Therefore.
it seems possible that much of the melt water could have penetrated into the ice locally,
although not on an intergranular scale.

T'his picture of water flow is similar to the theoretical predictions of Shreve (1g72), but
the concentration of the surface melt-water flux from the fine-scale vein network to the larger-
scale conduits occurs ina thin layer just below the surface. The small residual intergranular
flux of less than o.1 ma ' during the height of the melt scason suggests that the vein network
does not respond to the availability of surface melt water. This could be a consequence of a
very small i sttu vein size and water velocity, in which case the propagation of kinematic
waves hypothesized by Nye and Frank (1975) would also be slow. Howeversicmight also be
caused by the tendency of water flux to concentrate from smaller into larger conduits Shreve,
1972 Rothlisberger, 1972) and thermal constraints on the manner in which clean surface melt
water can enter into the ice. "The nature of the control on the size of veins and the origin ol
conduits arc important questions which remain unanswered.

6.4 Water flowe and glacier temperature
I'his picture of the water low needs to be reconciled with the known i situ ice temperature
Harrison. 1975[b]). The ice below approximately 6 m depth is about 0.02 deg colder than
expected from the temperature lowering by the overburden pressure. It is unlikely that
this depression could be caused by a large difference between vein and ice pressures: most
likely it arises from dissolved impuritics as assumed in Section 5.3. On the other hand. the
temperature depression from impurities in the surface melc water (mostly dissolved air) is an
order of magnitude smaller. 16 surface water does enter the veins, the impurities in it would
have 1o be greatly concentrated ;s it is not clear that such concentration is possible. A\ large
downward velocity in the veins therefore seems incompatible with the measured temperature
At the upper limit of vein size (Table I, column 2) the mean downward water velocity would
be about 6o ma ' if large numbers of veins are not blocked. This water motion should affect
substantial thicknesses on a short time scale. However, the temperature changes over a year
were extremely small even at the highest sensors (Harrison, 1975[b]). "This suggests that the
in st vein sizes are indeed less than the upper limits which we set. or that the network is
discontinuous because of bubbles or unknown effects not observable in the samples because
of the relaxation. In coarse bubbly ice the mean velocity may be more than an ovder of
magnitude smaller than in clear ice because of the blocking effects of bubbles. I it were less
than several meters per year, then possibly ablation could keep pace with penetration of clean
surface water even on a long time scale. It is possibly relevant that the temperature sensors
were roughly 8o m down-glacicr from the core sites. where the fine-grained zone of ice may
have been thinner or absent. In any case, the temperature measurements indicate that flow
through the veins does not flush impurities very effectively.

A second problem concerns the flow in conduits. Conduits would also tend to warm the
ice, and their presence would not be consistent with the temperature if the warming time were
less than the length of the melt season. For a conduit density of 1 m 2. one finds from the
method deseribed in Appendix â‚¬ that the ice could be warmed o the temperature of the
