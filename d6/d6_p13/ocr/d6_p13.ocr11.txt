LIQUID AND GAS PHASES IN TEMPERATE GLAGIER 1CE 223
5. RELATION TO in silu CONDITIONS

The relation between conditions in the ice as seen under the microscope and the i situ
conditions in the glacier, where the stress and temperature environments are different, is
considered in this section.

5.1. Bubbles

The bubbles isolated from the veins always contained water at the time of observation,
but the i situ liquid content was probably small or zero. More details are given by Raymond
in press).

T'he pressure in the veins probably dropped from its in sitw value to near aumospheric
pressure while the core was being raised 1o the glacicr surface. "The gas bubbles touching
veins should have expanded into the vein network 1o reach the sample surface and relax the
bubble pressure. During the inidal stages of this process. Equation (2h) and the pressure
gradient expected from the in sitw bubble pressures and the core size predict that water should
have been forced out of the veins at speeds in excess of millimeters per second. This is so rapid
that the process probably happened progressively as a core was brought to the surface. At
the time of observations. some sporadic motion of the ends of gas columns still was occurring
but was less than about 1 mms . This was caused possibly by small residual excess gas
pressure, readjustment of capillary forces with vein-size change, or by exsolution of dissolved
air. During the large initial pressure relaxation. the expulsion of gas was possibly along
favored vein paths because of the range in vein size (Fig. 7). and the vein liquid being forced
toward the core exterior probably would have been trapped in intervening bubbles. There-
fore. the process was not necessarily accompanied by a gross expulsion of the original vein
liquid.

The pressure velaxation could have produced air columns extending from bubbles into
veins as seen in the samples. Teis doubtful that this was the in situ configuration hecause it
cannot be in local thermal equilibrivim. Where such columns exist, the air pressure in the
bubbles exceeds the vein water pressure by pe Section 1.5, From Equations (5 and (4a)
the temperature depression in the bubbles from pe is Bpe — 2.0+ 10 8y L1z thisis Targer than
the temperature depression from wall curvature in the veins given by =/ .l x 0.82 < 10 ¥
\ L Ifdiffusion of impurities can occur and even out differences in concentration between
the vein liquid and any liquid on the walls of bubbles. then bubbles would be colder than veins.
At the other extreme. if gas only partially fills the volume ofa bubble cavity. then the thermal
effect of capillary pressure is eliminated and the veins are colder than the bubbles. A stable
configuration is probably an intermediate one in which the gas liquid meniscus lies within
the bubble vein orifice at a location such that its curvature produces a pressure difference
which just balances the effect of vein-wall curvature.

5.2. Lenses and other isolated liquid inclusions

Because of the elastic anisotropy of the ice erystals, it seems probable that certain sub-
volumes and grain faces continued 1o experience compressive stress for some time after the
core was raised 10 the glacier surface and the exterior pressure had dropped. In such zones
the pressure inisolated inclusions could have heen larger than the pressure in the veins or on
the sample exterior. Heat flow from the veins or the exterior could have caused the growth
of lenses on grain boundaries ' Nye and Mac. 1972) or liquid pods on certain three-grain
intersections for which grain-boundary energy relationships preclude the existence of stable
veins, Because the ice was initially cold and the veins contained impurities. the growth of
such inclusions could have heen blocked at fisst. However, the ice and veins could have
warmed rapidly as is discussed in Section 5.5,
