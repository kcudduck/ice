LIQUID AND GAS PIASES IN TEMPERATE GLACIER ICE 21
to the total number of faces inany volume containing a large number of crystals was always

there was not a very strong preferred orientation.

An example of bubbly ice is shown in Figure 4. Columms of air extend into veins from ai
bubbles touching the vein network. Bubbles isolated from the veins also were present.
especially in coarseice. These bubbles contained some liquid. Liquid in hubbles has also been
observed by Bader (1950). 'T'he configuration of air in the veins and liquid in the isolated
bubbles changed rapidly with time.

Vein widths dy were measured using a calibrated reticle. Figure 5 shows an example
of a water-filled vein and the dimension which would he specified as the wididh, The edges
were not sharply delincated lines, and the visible widih depended somewhat on the microscope
focus and illumination angle, but width could be chosen consistently to within about 5 to
1o s When gas occupied a vein, the gas column was sharp and its width could casily be
measured.

The details of the vein eross-sectional shapes were not examined. Qualitatively they had
the triangular cross section expected from the houndary -energy relatonships as discussed by
Nye and Frank 1973 p. 158, fig. 2). Nye and Mac 1g72) indicate that the dihedral angle
26 between the two solid-liquid interfaces at a vertex is typically 32 . This determines the
crossxection shape. Geometrical parameters of interest can be expressed in terms ol the

Itis not obvious how the width seen in the microscope is related to any of these parameters.
In Appendix A icis shown that the width of an air column in a vein should be about equal (o
the root-mean-square diameter of the vein or 27, In several cases, width was measured on a
vein at one time when it was liquid filled and at another time when it contained gas. These
were the same within measurement ervor. Also, the distributions of widths for liquid- and
gas-filled veins were nearly identical. These observations show that the width d, measured
on a liquid-filled vein can also be identified with the root-mean-square diameter.

Widths were measured on 1o to 8o randomly sclected veins in cach sample. The distance
below the sample surface of cach measured vein was not determined. but most measurements
were between several millimeters and about 1o mm depth. There was no obvious systematic
dependence of observed vein size on depth in the sample except a flaring very near the surface.
In most samples measurements were made between about 10 and 6o min after sample collec-
tion. During this time there was no apparent trend of vein=size change. In order 1o examine
how sizes changed on a longer time scale, several samples were measured afier one day, which
indicated that vein sizes increase slowly with time.
