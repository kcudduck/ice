3.2. Configuration of the liquid and gas phases on a granular scale

Veins of water were visible in all samples. An example of finc-grained clear ice is shown
in Ligure 1. As envisaged by Nye and Frank (1973), the veins were on three-grain inter-
sections and formed a three-dimensional network with four veins coming together at cach
four-grain intersection.  Occasional three-grain intersections in some samples did not have
continuous veins lying on them. Figure 2 shows an example in which a four-grain intersection
had only two visible veins running into it. The other two three-grain intersections were marked
by pods of liquid. Such three-grain intersections without veins were relatively infrequent in
the fine-grained ice. Although there is not a precise one-to-one correspondence between
continuous veins and three-grain interscetions, it scems to be a good approximation for

practical purposes. Continuity of the vein network in coarse-grained ice could not be checked
because tracing of the network topology over the scale of the grain size was hampered by the
large dimensions and poor visibility caused by bubbles. A few instances of an apparently
high proportion of missing veins were seen in coarse clear ice. An example is shown in Figure 5.

Liquid was also found (o exist in many samples as lenses on grain boundaries and in
irregular shapes as shown in Figure 3. Lenses on grain boundaries have been observed
previously in laboratory-grown ice (Nye and Mac. 1g72). The lenses were not concentrated
near three-grain interseetions. but were usually distributed over particular grain faces. Lenses
were sometimes associated with discontinuous veins as in Figure 33 however, there was not a
one-to-one correspondence. Lenses were observed close to veins of typical size. and dis-
continuous veins without nearby Ienses were seen. The proportion of grain faces with lenses
