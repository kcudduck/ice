LIQUID AND GAS PHASES IN TEMPERATE GLACIER [CE 221

Figure 6 shows the means and standard deviations of the width distributions for samples
collected from various depths. Distributions measured within about the first hour and
measured after one day are shown separately. Samples originating below 7 mshowed no
significant differences in vein size: nor was there any apparent correlation of width with
grain size or bubble content. Figure 7 shows the combined distribution of widths measured
within the first hour of collection for all samples below 7 m. From this distribution. we find

4.4 Larger-scale fealures

Large-scale tubular features, suggestive ol conduits, were seen in two cores. One such
featuwre with a diameter of about 1.9 mm was scen in a core cross section at .6 m depth.
Several others with diameters of a few millimeters were seen ina vertical slab (30 mm -
150 mm - 0.9 m) cut parallel to the core axis at 20 m depth (Figure 8/. In this case two o1
possibly three junctions of upward hranching could be seen: this fits the upward branching
“arborescent™ network of conduits envisaged by Shreve (1g72). The cross-sections of these
features were irregular as a result of rounded protrusions of the hounding crystals toward the
axis of the tube.

t- PROPERTIES OF VEINS

Some properties of the veins relevant o subsequent calculations in Sections 5 and 6 are
considered here.
q.1. Water transport

The water flux @ through a vein in the presence of an effective pressure gradient /e,
gradient of pressure and gravity potential) can be estimated by an approach similar to that
of Nye and Frank 11973/, Tor a circular tube with cross-sectional arca 1.
