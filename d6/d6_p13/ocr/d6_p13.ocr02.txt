1. InTrRODUCTION

Nye and Frank (1973) have proposed that temperate glacier ice should be permeable to
water flow because of a three-dimensional network of veins lying along three-grain inter-
sections. There are a number of processes in glaciers in which intergranular water {low
could play an important role. Intergranular water flow is one possible route by which surface
water can reach the glacier bed. The downward percolation of water could transport heat
by advection and provide an internal heat source coming from viscous dissipation. It could
dissolve and transport gases and soluble solids, thus affecting the texture and chemistry of the
glacier ice. The vein network would provide the only means by which water produced by
the mechanical production of heat could be drained from the ice. Furthermore, the veins
may be important in the formation of larger conduits in the ice such as discussed by Rothlis-
berger (1972) and Shreve (1972).

The existence of veins in ice samples has been observed (Nye and I'rank, 1973). However.
the existence of a connected three-dimensional network has not been established o exist in
flowing glacicr ice, and Lliboutry (1971) and Nyce and Mae (1972) have given reason to
doubt its existence because of complications in texture and non-hydrostatic stress. Even if
the vein network is essentially complete, it is not possible to deduce the amount of water flow
through it without knowledge of the size of the veins, a quantity which present theories are
not capable of predicting.

The purpose of this paper is to present observations of the liquid and gas phases in core
samples from Blue Glacier, Mt Olympus, Washington, U.S.A. The glacier is deseribed by
Kamb (1939). Allen and others (1960), LaChapelle (1965). Corbatd (1965, Harrison (1972
and Meicr and others (1974). The coring was done during the third and fourth weeks of
August 1972 at a site slightly below the usual late-summer snow line. The site was at an
clevation of about 1 590 m near the 1961 location of the bore hole sz of Shreve and Sharp
(1970, p. 67). A year earlicr sensors had been placed at a site roughly 30 m down glacier in a
related experiment to measure deep in situ temperature (Harrison, 1975[b]). Samples were
examined at about 1.5 m intervals to a depth of about 6o m or about a quarter of the total
depth.

Experimental methods are deseribed in Section 2. The observations and their relation to
in situ conditions arc found in Scctions 3 and 5: some vein propertics used in subsequent
sections are collected in Section 4. A tentative picture of the water flow through veins and
larger-scale features is given in Scction 6.

2. METHODS

Cores were obtained with a thermal core drill yielding cores o.15 m in diameter and 1.6 m
in length (LaChapelle and Taylor, unpublished). Immediately upon removal from the core
barrel, cores were covered 1o prevent exposure to short-wave radiation and carried to a
nearby snow cave. â€˜There a sample about o.1m thick was cut perpendicular to the axis of
cach core. Observations began typically within 20 min of breaking the core off at the bottom
of the hole and within 5 min ofits arrival at the surface. Observations were continued usually
for about one hour.

Microscopic observations were made with a stereoscopic microscope capable of magnifica-
tions of 6 to 100 times. A special stand allowed placement of large samples under the micro-
scope. The distance from the objective lens to its planc of focus was go mm in air, which
permitted examination of features well into samples. A beam splitter with 35 mm camera
mount allowed simultancous visual observations and  photography.  Size measurements
could be made with a calibrated reticle.

T'he microscope and sample were positioned on a transparent table with illumination
provided by a 100 W bulb mounted about 0.2 m beneath the table surface. In most cases
