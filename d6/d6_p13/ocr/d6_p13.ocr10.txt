The flow through a system of veins ol isotropic texture is considered next, now assuming
that I represents the effective pressure gradient averaged over several grain sizes. Ina vein
inclined at an angle i 1o F, the flux parallel to I7is Q cos b, IMwe average over all directions,

the scale of the vein diameter of several tens of micrometers, impurity diffusion evens out the
concentration within seconds. Therefore Equation (4b) applies to the complete perimeter of a
vein unless extremely rapid melting or freezing is taking place.

In Appendix A it is shown that the gas liquid pressure difference in a vein partially
occupicd by gas is close to i 291y r where yp 0.076 J m 2 is the lquid-vapor surface
