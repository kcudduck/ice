A typical depth below the sample surface for measured veins is about 5 mm., and time of
measurement is about 30 min after sample collection. Based on the above limits on i situ size.
the possible range of vein properties predicted ac this depth and time are represented as
curves short dashes) in Figure g for various textures and depths of origin. For example,
fine-grained ice originating from 60 m and inidal size A 1.9 - 10 '"m? would follow the
path P, P, P and would have a size about equal to the observed size at the time of observa-
tion. Very coarse clear ice relaxes rapidly hecause of a low water content, which causes the
contribution from the internal source term to be small. At the other extreme, coarse bubbly
ice does not heat up above the temperature depression caused by air pressure in the bubbles
isolated from the veins, and relaxation of the bubble pressure by heat conduction or mechani-
cal effects is very slow (Raymond, in press). The inital bubble pressure is probably near the
ice overburden pressure, which for 60 m origin depth gives 6” — 0.049 deg and this changes
very slowly during the first hour. Table T1, column g gives values ol in situ size expected
from this model for several textures and depths of origin.

Adiabatic relaxation by rapid replacement of impurities. At the opposite extreme we may
consider a case where the liquid in the veins not only experiences an abrupt pressure drop but
also a drop in impurity content to a concentration corresponding to that in the layer of water
on the external surface. Because the diffusivity of typical soluble impurities in water is small
in comparison to the effective thermal diffusivity of the ice, diffusion is not rapid enough to
exchange impurities before significant heat flow from the surface has occurred. However,
water {low could possibly replace the vein water rapidly and continuously. If this happens.
the vein would be held at a temperature depression 8 corresponding to 65 except for a small
contribution due to vein-wall curvature. The ice could be heated up nearly 1o its final
equilibrium temperature by [reezing in the veins and local redistribution of heat on a granular
scale. The net effect would be reduction in vein size, and is worked out in Appendix B.
assuming no heat flows in from the sample surface. This gives estimates of in situ sizes shown
in Table 11, column 4. The time scale for this 1o happen is similar to that for the pressure
relaxation considered above and in Appendix B, but the size and temperature changes are
larger because the impurities are not permitted (o concentrate in the shrinking veins.

Il the water-drainage velocities were too slow to affect the bulk core before a sample was
cut from it, which seems likely, then the replacement of impurities beneath the upper flat
surface of a disk-like sample (Scetion 2) would not start until it was cut out. Even il the sub-
sequent replacement of impurities were essentially instantancous, heat flow from the sample
surface would contribute to the heating of the ice within several grain diameters below the
surface. The estimates in Table T, column 4 apply only at greater depth in the sample.
