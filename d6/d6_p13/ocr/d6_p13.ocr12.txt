If the residual clastic compressive stress on a grain face is on the order of one bar and the
corresponding elastic stress can be relieved by relative displacements on the scale of the grain
size (¢. 1072 m), then the stress could be relieved by melting a 1 pm layer of water averaged
over the grain face. From Nye and Mac (1972, p. 93 and g4) onc finds that the average
thickness of a lens is about 0.07 times its diameter, which for lenses of diameter about 0.1 mm
(for examples as shown in Fig. 3) amounts to 7 wm. This suggests that a considerable fraction
of a grain face could have been covered by lenses before the driving compressive stress was
relieved by the melting. The existence of lenses on grain boundarices of various orientations
as seen in the samples (Section 3.2) gives support to this mode of lens formation. On the
other hand, no concentration of lenses near the sample surface or veins was noticed, but this
might be expected as a result of rapid formation by the above process. It seems difficult to
draw any certain conclusions about the in situ existence of lenses.

5.3. Veins

Redistribution of heat within a sample, conduction of heat into the sample from its surface,
and exchange of impurities, could have caused vein sizes to change before they were measured.
The relaxation process can be discussed in terms of Figure g, in which the combined tempera-
ture depression 0" of a vein from dissolved impurities and vein-wall curvature given by

is shown as a function of .1 for various values of impurity per unit length of vein €. The vein
size .l is about 6.6 - 10 " m? in the samples. and the sample vein properties lie somewhere
on the vertical line marked Aoupre. The i situ temperature 7 is known below a depth of
about 6 m (Harrison, 1975[b]) and the in sitw 8" can be estimated from Equation (4a) and the
assumption that vein pressure is equal to the mean stress in the ice. A very small vertical
strain-rate (Harrison. 1975[a]) provides evidence that the ice mean stress is close o the
overburden pressure. ‘This gives an i situ " ranging from 0.020 to 0.028 deg depending on
depth and time: 0° — 0.024 deg is reasonably characteristic of the whole depth range. The
i situ vein properties lie near the horizontal line marked 6,

Relaxation without impurily exchange. 1f the impuritics do not move significantly along the
length of veins by diffusion or water {low during the relaxation process, then it is reasonable
to assume that (7 remains constant. In this case the vein properties change by displacement
along the lines of constant € shown in Figure g.

The initial stages of the relaxation are associated with pressure drop in the veins as a core
is raised from depth to the surface of the glacier as discussed in Section 5.1, This raises the
vein wall temperature above the temperature of the surrounding ice and the resulting heat
flow causes freezing on the vein walls corresponding to displacement along a line of constant
Cupward to the left. This process of local redistribution of heat is analysed in Appendix B.
The process should have been complete within several minutes after the drop in pressure;
it was probably already complete before samples were cut from the core. The resulting change
in vein size and temperature depends on texture and the pressure drop. For samples collected
near the glacier surface, there is little pressure drop. the changes are small, and the vein
propertics would still plot near the horizontal line 6, in Figure 9. The possible vein size change
and the corresponding change in 6" are substantial for samples collected from 60 m, and are
shown by curves (long dashes in igure 9) for a fine texture (/ — 10m 2 ¢ x 2 mm) and a
coarse texture (/= 10'm 2 a x 20mm). For example, fine-grained ice from 60 m with
initial vein properties corresponding to P, would change to P,.

On a somewhat longer time scale, heat conducts into the sample from its surface, which
causes melting of the veins and displacement along a line of constant ¢ downward and to the
