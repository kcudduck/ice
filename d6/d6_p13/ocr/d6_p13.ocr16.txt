intergranular water flux per unit arca can be calculated from Equation (3a) and this value
of I, using the upper limiting values of .1 determined in Section 5.3 (Table 11, column 2).
L'he results for typical fine and coarse ice textures are listed in Table TT1. column 2.

6.2. Effect of bubbles

‘The in situ configuration of gas bubbles touching veins expected from Section 5.1 agrees
with the view of Lliboutry (1971, p. 20, fig. 2). Such bubbles constitute local blockages of
veins which can support pressure differences up to the capillary pressure pe. Since by Equation

5) peis about 0.1 bar or more for the expected in situ vein sizes, the bubbles are closely spaced,
and the effective pressure gradient is only about 0.01 bar m=', it seems unlikely that such
pressure differences would be achieved in typical circumstances in the glacier.

A simple statistical model developed in Appendix D gives the fractional reduction in ice
permeability in terms of the average spacing s of bubbles along veins and the average distance
b between four-grain intersections. I bubbles are randomly distributed in the ice volume,

where R is the average bubble radius, and v is the fractional void volume. Although the two
bubble counts reported in Section 3.1 suggest that bubbles were not strictly randomly distri-
buted, there probably arce not any large errors from this source and Equation (8) should give a
reasonable estimate. The density and bubble sizes measured on coarse bubbly ice (Section
3.1) give s about 20 mm. This also agrees with the average spacing of bubbles on random
lines (s equals 25 mm and 15 mm) measured on the two coarse bubbly samples (grain size a
cquals 21 mm and 14 mm) which were measured in more detail (Section 3.1). One also
expects that b x a. Thercfore in typical coarse bubbly ice b/s is on the order of 1 or larger,
in which case the results of Appendix D predict that bubbles substantially reduce the water
flux. In fine-grained ice the effects of bubbles are much less. Theoretical fractional reduction
in water flux by bubbles is given in Table I11. column § for various grain sizes assuming
s = 20mm and b — a.
6.3. General pattern of flow and discussion

At the core-hole site, water production averaged over a typical day was about 25 mm d !
or gma '), ‘The pattern of ice texture (Section 3.1) and the limits on intergranular water
flow ("T'able 111} place some constraints on how this melt water moved.

The absence of any surface pools or streams indicates that all of the melt water penetrated
into the snow. Fine ice with the vein size seen in the sample from 4.8 m would transport a
flux per unit area of about 10 ma~" according to Equation (3a). This suggests that much
of the melt water could have penetrated into the uppermost ice and agrees with the observa-
tions of Wakahama and others (1973). who concluded that the ice near the surface of Menden-
hall Glacier was permeable. However, once below 7 m depth in the zone of mostly fine ice

a & 2 mm), the intergranular flux per unit area would be no greater than 0.1 ma ' (‘Table
