SHAPE OF AIR COLUMNS IN VEINS

When gas enters o vein, s shape must satisfy the requirements of mechanical equilibrium. Qualitatively,
the gas (ills the central portion of the vein, excluding the liquid to fillets at the three vertices. Details of the shape
can be worked out approximately by assuming that the pressure difference across the liquid gas interface is
everywhere the sane. The interface between the gas-filled central part of a vein and the liquid in the fillets is
avlindrical and the corresponding pressure difference is casily caleulated as a function of the cross-sectional
shape of the gas column. The interface at the end of a gas column is doubly curving. but the pressure difference
can be estimated using the hydraulic radius of the gas column cross-section Bacr. 1g72. p. 441, Lquating these
two pressure differences determines the shape of the gas column crosssection. The width averaged over all
viewing directions is 1.917, where 7 is the root-meanssquare radius, The difference between the gas and liquid
pressures. the capillary pressure, is given by 2.4y 7 where yy s the liquid gas surface energy.

F'his configuration is not in thermal cquilibrium. Because the pressure in the gas is Targer than that in the
liquid. those parts of the vein wall exposed 10 the gas must be colder than those adjacent o the liquid near the
vertices. Whatever the details. melting and refreczing would cause a rounding of both vein and air-column cross
section. Since heat would be transported only Tocally, there should not be much change in total vein cross-sectional
area. N\ limiting cross-sectional shape would be civcalar with the Tiquid excluded almost entirely, in which case
the width of the air colummn would be 27, Although the shape of the end of the gas colunin could still be complex,
it would probably be close 1o hemispherical. which would give capillary pressure 2y14 7. Because of the small
scale of the veins. it is likely that the local redistribution of heat oceurs rapidly. 1 the vein liquid contains im-
puritics. the process could be slowed. hut o similar shape change would oceur as long as impurities can diffuse
along the vein walls,

ADIABATIC RELAXATION

When the vein pressure or impurity content is changed. melting or freezing will occur at the vein walls, and
the Tatent heat will change the temperature of the surrounding ice. 1 the process is adiabatic and the liquid

Fhe time for adjustment of the vein size can be roughly estimated by assuming the vein o be evlindrical and
o be surrounded by an infinite medium of ice. The rate of heat flow is then caleulated by standard analytical
methods (Carslaw and Jacger, 1950 . Equilibrium will be reached when the total heat flow per unit length of

that the process is adiabatic. or that little heat conducts in from the surface before its completion, is therefore
reasonable for Tocations which are more than several grain diaimeters into the core,
