right. Eventually the inward conduction of heat ceases when 8" becomes equal to the tem-

perature depression fs from impurities in the liquid layer on the exterior surface, in which

case temperature gradients have been eliminated. Because the bulk impurity content of the
ice was measured to be extremely small. it is likely that g is determined by the amount of air
in solution at ambient atmospheric pressure (about 0.82 bar) which gives 6. - 0.002 0 deg.

This is plotted as the horizontal line 6. on Iigure g. For example, the vein properties would

relax by local redistribution of heat to P, progress back to Py, pass through P, and eventually

reach P, where relaxation would stop.

With these constraints on the initial and final values of 6" and on the relaxation path.
the in situ vein size can only be in the range L 1o U for ice originating near the surface, L o
Uy for fine ice from 60 m, and L to U, for coarse ice from 60 m. Numerical values of these
limits are listed in Table 1. columns 1 and 2.

In order to narrow the limits further it is necessary to know the time scale of the heating.
I'his was studied by solution of the equation of thermal diffusion with a source term which
accounts for the heat of fusion associated with change in vein size (Appendix ). The vein
properties after the pressure relaxation provide initial conditions, and the temperature on the
external surfaces provides boundary conditions. For simplicity. the circumferential surface
of the disk-shaped samples was neglected and the solution was carried out for slab geometry.
The solutions show rapid vein size changes during the first several minutes and sirong
gradients in the first several millimeters below the surface. At later times and greater depth
the variations are much less pronounced and are small enough 1o be compatible with the
apparent lack in the samples of a depth gradient and time dependence during the initial hour
