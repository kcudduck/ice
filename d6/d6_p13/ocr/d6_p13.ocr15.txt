LIQUID AND GAS PITASES IN TEMPERATE GLACIER ICE 227

Discussion. 1 conduction from the surface has already heated the ice and diluted the vein
liquid by the time surface liquid arrives, there will be litde effect from motion of impuritics.
A rough measure of the time needed to change significantly the temperature at distance
below the sample surface by conduction is 2/« where « is the effective thermal diffusivity
(Carslaw and Jacger, 1959, p. 60). The corresponding time for penctration of surface water
to this depth is v/, where w is the water drainage velocity. Therefore. when x2/x € vju or
wxu 3 1. the effects of impurity replacement should be small. We may expeet that «jxu 1
represents a transition,

Appendix C gives the dependence of won 21/ and 0771 he water drainage velocity can be
estimated from Equation (4h) with the effective pressure gradient I (py—pi)g 0.01 bar
m ' This is the average value of I7if the sample is supported by a water layer at its base,
and the water layer on the upper surface is thick enough to eliminate capillary effects there.
Since a sample could be partially supported on local points of contact, I could be somewhat
larger. Values of «/xu are shown in Table I for the various textures and estimates of in situ
vein size assuming 0 is the in situ value and v is 5 mm.

For fine-grained ice x/xu 3 1 for any of the estimated in situ sizes (Table 1), This would
be true even if /7 and the drainage velocity were somewhat larger than assumed. Therefore
the adiabatic relaxation by replacement of impurities should not occur, and the assumption
of constant () is reasonable. We can be fairly confident that the upper limits to vein size listed
in Table T, column 2 are valid. ‘The more refined predictions of i situ size in Table 11,
column 5 are consistent with the observational and theoretical constraints which we have
discussed. but there are factors which have not been taken into account and which could
significantly affect the time scale of the relaxation and those predictions. Examples are:
the effect of liquid at locations other than veins, some effect from water flow, and the possi-
bility that i st 67 is different from that assumed. Therefore we choose o Timit our con-
clusions to the upper limits of column 2.

The same reasoning can be applicd o coarse ice, but in this case the values of w/yu are
not so large. The values in Table 11, column 4 are close to or even smaller than one. The
relaxation of veins of these in situ sizes would no doubt be significanty affected by water
motion: however, the values of «/vu seem still too large to permit the dramatic freezing that
would be needed to give the size seen in the samples. Furthermore in coarse ice the charac-
teristic measurement depth of 5 mm into the sample is less than the grain size, and the i situ
sizes listed in Table 11, column 4 would be over estimates even i« vu were zero as discussed
previously. Given that the in situ size must have been significantly smaller than listed in
column 4 of Table I1, then «/xu would have been greater than one. This leads to the con-
clusion that the sizes listed in Table 11, column 2 are also reasonable upper limits in the case
of coarse ice.

On a time scale longer than one hour, water flow and diffusion must be important. The
expected drainage velocity for the vein size existing in the samples is about 6 mm h and
would tend 1o keep 0 in the veins equal to . Because of the vein-wall curvature, the veins
would be colder than the surface. Solution of the heat-flow equation with the source term
from vein size change evaluated from Equation (4a) and # constant (Appendix C) predicts
an increase in vein arca of about 2 to 3 times over 24 h. This could explain the observed
increase in vein size after one day (Figure 6).

Nye and Frank (1973) assume that the pressure of water in veins is equal to the mean ice
pressure. Shreve (1972) has derived the resulting effective pressure gradient /7 under sloped
ice surfaces. which for the core site gives I~ 0.013 barm . Upper limiting values for the
