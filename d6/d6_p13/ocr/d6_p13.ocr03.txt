oblique transmitted light provided the highest contrast and best viewing. In the upper part of
the sample, where most observations were made, calculation ol the rate of absorption of
radiation indicates that at most 10 ¢ fractional volume of the ice could be melied per hour
ol continuous illumination. "I'o minimize internal melting from the lamp. it was turned on
only when measurements were being made, and an aperture was used so only a small part of
the sample was illuminated at any one time.

T'hin sections of the core cross-sections were made from samples cut near the microscope
samples. They were photographed under crossed polaroids o record textural information.
Some thin sections and ctched surfaces were also examined divectly.

3. OBSERVATIONS ON SAMPLES
s Texture

The number of grain-boundary intercepts per unit length of randomly oriented lines was
measured on thin sections and ctched surfaces. The reciprocal is denoted by a and is a
standard definition of grain size (McLean, 1957, p. 112). The number of three-grain inter-
sections crossing unit area of section was also counted. This quantity is denoted by n. A«
long as the grain texture is isotropic or 2 is counted on a number of random sections, the length
[ of three-grain intersections per unit volume is given by [ — 2n (Smith and Guttman, 19535,.

Although' there is no unique relationship between a and n. one expects for dimensional
reasons that 7 - k/a*, where & is a textural parameter. On six thin sections which were
measured with special care £ ranged from 0.8 to 2.1. Since water content and water flow are
more direetly related to 7 than a, n is used in most of the subsequent discussion, and a corres-
ponding approximatc grain size is based on a single value of & — 2.

As expected from Allen and others (1960}, the samples usually fell into two basic textural
types: fine ice with 7z x 5105 m * (@ x 2 mm) and coarse ice with 103 m 2 nol 2 10h
m 2 romm < a <7 50 mm). lee of intermediate or mixed grain size was also present but
in smaller amounts.,

Over the depth range of the core hole, three distinet structural zones could be distinguished.
I'he highest zone was a layer of snow about 2 m deep. Between the snow and depth 27 m
there was a zone of mostly fine ice with only weak foliation. There were local occurrences
of mixed or coarse texture. Most of the ice was bubbly, but there were several 1 10 2m
lengths of perfectly clear core from depths of 1o, 20, and 235 m. Below 27 m. there was a
transition over several meters depth to a third zone of mostly coarse-grained bubbly ice with
well developed foliation dipping at angles of about 75 at 30 m depth and 6o at 60 m depth.
In this zone. clear ice was restricted to relatively thin layers in the foliation pattern.

Densities of 15 typical coarse bubbly ice samples were measured and 0.go Mg m 3 was
found to be characteristic. Distributions of bubble size were measured in three typical coarse
bubbly samples: these gave average bubble diameters ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 mm.  An
additional measure of bubble content in two coarse bubbly samples was determined by
counting the number of bubbles intersecting a line of known length randomly placed on a
planc section. T'he average bubble spacing on such lines was 25 mm for a sample with
a 21 mm and was 15 mm for a sample with @ — 14 mm.

In order to investigate the distribution of bubbles with respect to grain boundaries, the
number of bubbles touching the trace of grain boundaries was also counted for these two
samples. In cach case the length of grain boundary trace was also estimated by the method of
Smith and Gutiman (1953) using three orientations of a square grid with mesh about equal
to a. The resulting estimates of the average spacing of bubbles along grain boundary trace
were somewhat smaller 743, and 45",,) than along random lines. This suggests some con-
centration of bubbles along grain boundaries, but with so few samples it is difficult to say
whether this is characteristic.
