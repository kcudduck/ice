[1] Probably the most important mechanism of glacial erosion is quarrying: the growth
and coalescence of cracks in subglacial bedrock and dislodgement of resultant rock
fragments. Although evidence indicates that erosion rates depend on sliding speed, rates of
crack growth in bedrock may be enhanced by changing stresses on the bed caused by
fluctuating basal water pressure in zones of ice-bed separation. To study quarrying in
real time, a granite step, 12 cm high with a crack in its stoss surface, was installed at the
bed of Engabreen, Norway. Acoustic emission sensors monitored crack growth events in
the step as ice slid over it. Vertical stresses, water pressure, and cavity height in the
lee of the step were also measured. Water was pumped to the lee of the step several times
over 8 days. Pumping initially caused opening of a leeward cavity, which then closed after
pumping was stopped and water pressure decreased. During cavity closure, acoustic
emissions emanating mostly from the vicinity of the base of the crack in the step increased
dramatically. With repeated pump tests this crack grew with time until the step’s lee
surface was quarried. Our experiments indicate that fluctuating water pressure caused
stress thresholds required for crack growth to be exceeded. Natural basal water pressure
fluctuations should also concentrate stresses on rock steps, increasing rates of crack
growth. Stress changes on the bed due to water pressure fluctuations will increase in
magnitude and duration with cavity size, which may help explain the effect of sliding
speed on erosion rates.
