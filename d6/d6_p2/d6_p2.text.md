From Snow to Firn to Glacier ice

Snow
How do we build a glacier? We start with a snowﬂake. Snow, over time, is compressed into ﬁrn, and
then into glacier ice.

Snow falls in cold regions, such as mountain tops or in polar regions. In glaciology, snow refers to
material that has not changed since it fell1.

Snow is very light and ﬂuﬀy, and has a very low density. If the snow is wetter, it will have an
increased density. Snowﬂakes have a hexagonal structure, and fallen snow has a signiﬁcant amount
of air in it.

Firn
Firn is usually deﬁned as snow that is at least one year old and has therefore survived one melt
season, without being transformed to glacier ice.

Firn is transformed gradually to glacier ice as density increases with depth, as older snow is buried by
newer snow falling on top of it. Year after year, successive accumulation layers are built up. In the
accumulation zone of a glacier, density therefore increases with depth; the rate depends on the local
climate and rate of accumulation1. Firn transforms to glacier ice at a density of 830 kg m-3.

Firn transforms to glacier ice in 3-5 years in the temperate Upper Seward Glacier in the St Elias
Mountains near the Alaska-Yukon border. Firn becomes ice at a depth of about 13 m1. At sites like this
with rapid snow accumulation, the depth of a ﬁrn layer, and the load on it, increases rapidly with
depth.

However, in cold, dry East Antarctica, ﬁrn becomes ice at a depth of 64 m at Byrd and 95 m at Vostok.
280 years are needed at Byrd, and 2500 at Vostok. Low temperatures slow the transformation.
Temperatures at Vostok, the coldest region of Earth, are 30°C lower than Byrd, which explains the
slower increase in density. In addition, slow accumulation gives slow burial, and a small load each

year; the increase in density takes much longer.

Typically, the transformation of ﬁrn to ice takes 100-300 years, and a depth of 50 – 80 m1.

Glacier ice
Firn becomes glacier ice when the interconnecting air or water-ﬁlled passageways between the grains
are sealed oﬀ (“pore closure”)1. Air is isolated in separate bubbles. This occurs at a density of 830 kg
m-3. The air space between particles is reduced, bonds form between them, and the particles grow
larger. This is a process known as sintering. Increasing pressure compresses the bubbles, placing the
enclosed air under pressure and increasing the density of the ice2.

Fresh snowﬂakes, which have a complex shape, have a large surface area. Over time and under
pressure, the surface area is reduced, the surface is smoothed, and the total surface area is reduced.
Fresh, complex snowﬂakes are transformed into rounded particles.

The transformation of ﬁrn to ice is much faster where there is melting and refreezing . Meltwater can
percolate downwards, inﬁlling porespaces, and the displaced air escapes upwards. If the snow is
under 0°C, the water will freeze, producing areas of compact ice. This will produce high density ice
much more rapidly than in colder regions without melting.

The density of pure glacier ice is usually taken as 917 kg m-3. This strictly is only true at 0°C and in
the upper layers of ice sheets and mountain glaciers; the density may be greater at the mid-depth
ranges in polar ice sheets, where there are no bubbles and temperatures are -20°C to -40°C1.

Below 4 km of ice, such as at the centre of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the pressure would increase
the density to 921 kg m-3.

Bubbles
Bubbles are common in glacier ice. Bubbles can contain liquid water or atmospheric gases, making
them very useful for ice core research. The air in the bubble largely reﬂects the atmospheric
concentrations when the ice formed1. In polar environments, bubbles in the ice occupy about 10% of
the volume when ﬁrn turns to ice.

rich ice.

With greater depth in polar ice sheets, bubbles shrink as the overlying ice increases. The gas pressure
within the bubbles therefore increases, and at certain depths, the gas attains a dissociation pressure.
The bubbles begin to disappear as the gas molecules form clathrate hydrates1. This process takes
thousands of years.

Debris
Glacier ice contains various impurities in tiny amounts. By most scales, glacier ice is a very pure solid-
earth material, because the processes leading to snowfall on a glacier – evaporation, condensation,
precipitation – act as a natural distillation system1.

However, glaciers can contain impurities. The dirtiest glaciers are mountain glaciers, where debris can
fall directly onto the ice surface. On ice sheets and glaciers, dust and other debris may blow onto the
ice surface.

Debris on the ice surface can aﬀect the absorption of energy at the ice surface, and lead to increased
or decreased melting.

Layers in the ice
Glaciers are composed of sedimentary layers in their accumulation zones, formed of annual layers of
snowfall. These layers are initially parallel to the glacier surface. This is the primary stratiﬁcation in

structural glaciology.

In temperate and subpolar settings, the annual sedimentary layers consist of alternating thick layers
of bubble-rich ice, which originated as winter snow, and thin layers of clear ice, which are the refrozen
meltwater from the summer melt season.

blown dust) on the ice surface.

In cold polar regions, annual layering forms instead by seasonal variation of snow metamorphism and
wind deposition1.

Blue glacier ice
Glacier ice is blue because the longer visible wavelengths are absorbed. The more energetic, blue,
wavelengths are scattered back2. The eﬀect is greatest with deep, basal ice, which is bubble free and
has large crystals. The blue colour tends therefore to be most intense in the calls of calved icebergs
or fresh fractures.

Rough, weathered ice and fresh snow will appear white because preferential absorption does not
occur.
