                                          incident body waves (P-waves, horizontal and vertical S-waves) generate surface (Rayleigh and Love) waves
                                          that remain trapped within the shallow layer. When the wavelengths of the incident waves are comparable to
                                          the layer's thickness, resonance effects occur. Consequently, the resulting surface waves may have a much larger
                                          amplitude than the incident waves (e.g., Picotti et al., 2017). In most cases where a 1D soft layer is underly-

                                          (Konno & Ohmachi, 1998). Under reasonable assumptions, the first HVSR natural peak gives a reliable esti-

                                          spectral peaks correspond to a superposition of higher Rayleigh-wave, Love-wave, and S-wave resonance modes
                                          (Bonnefoy-Claudet et al., 2008).

                                          The HVSR technique is commonly used to retrieve the site amplification function and its resonance frequency
                                          in shallow geological layers (e.g., Bonnefoy-Claudet et al., 2006; Fäh et al., 2001, 2008; Lachetl & Bard, 1994;
                                          Panzera et al., 2018, 2022; Seht & Wohlenberg, 1999; Tuan et al., 2011) and Alpine valleys (Panzera et al. (2022)).
                                          It is also deployed to map soft sediment layers and estimate glacier thickness (e.g., Barnaba et al., 2010; Molnar
                                          et al., 2022; Picotti et al., 2017; Preiswerk et al., 2019; Seivane et al., 2022). Picotti et al. (2017) applied the
                                          HVSR method to five glaciers in the Alpine chain and the west Antarctic ice stream. Their results show how
                                          well the resonance frequency in the HVSR spectra correlates with the local bedrock depth over a wide range of
                                          ice thicknesses—from a few tens of meters to more than 800 m. The authors validated their results using other
                                          methods, such as GPR, geoelectrical, and active seismic techniques. The limitations of the HVSR method and its
                                          reliability for glacier characterization have been addressed in various studies, as reviewed by Picotti et al. (2017)
                                          and Molnar et al. (2022). Both groups identify coupling of the sensors with the glacier and the basal impedance
                                          contrast as the main controlling factors. Preiswerk et al. (2019) investigated how the glacier's geometry influ-
                                          ences the seismic wavefield and reported an azimuth dependence of the HVSR curves' shape. They relate such
                                          directivity to higher-order resonance effects caused by the glacier's morphology (like bedrock irregularities). On
                                          glaciers, Carcione et al. (2017) demonstrated that attenuation and bedrock deformability affect both frequency
                                          and amplitude of HVSR peaks. Moreover, Saenger et al. (2006, 2009) used the HVSR method to extract hydro-
                                          carbon maps, focusing on HVSR troughs (or peaks of the inverse—Vertical-to-Horizontal—spectral ratio, noted
                                          VHSR) to detect impedance anomalies. Specifically, they reported a peak in the VHSR (typically, values above
                                          1: i.e., vertical energy higher than horizontal energy) at a specific frequency detected by seismic sensors placed
                                          above hydrocarbon reservoirs. Similarly, Antunes et al. (2022) noticed that VHSR peaks provides information
                                          about seismic energy anomalies generated by fluids in reservoirs since the wavefield is mainly polarized in the
                                          vertical direction. They identified a link between the location of the VHSR peak amplitude and the presence of
                                          mud and gas inside a volcanic conduit; they also noticed a spatial correlation between high VHSR anomalies
                                          and low resistivity anomalies in geoelectric profiles, corresponding to dome-like reservoirs and associated with
                                          high-salinity fluids.

                                          Here, we analyze spectral ratios from ambient seismic noise measured for the Tête-Rousse Glacier (Mont Blanc
                                          massif) with the aim of locating potential cavities or areas containing melting water within the glacier. We first
                                          present the study area and the seismic data experiment in the field, we next detail the results of spectral analysis
                                          obtained from our dense, temporary seismic array. We interpret horizontal polarization of seismic noise around
                                          9 Hz detected by HVSR peaks as the fundamental mode for the whole glacier. Vertical polarization anomalies
                                          at higher frequencies detected by HVSR troughs (i.e., more intuitive, VHSR peaks) are considered to reflect
                                          reduced basal impedance due to the presence of a cavity or a local anomalous basal response in some areas
                                          of the glacier. Results obtained in the field are supported by a proof-of-concept simulation based on the 3D
                                          finite-element method.

                   The Tête-Rousse Glacier is located in the Mont Blanc massif in the French Alps (Figure 1a), along one of the
                   classic ascension routes (Figure 1b), making it a very popular site among mountaineers. Fed by avalanches in
                   its upper part, this glacier is approximately 450 m long and 150 m wide, with a maximum depth of 80 m, and its
                   surface topography extends from 3,100 to 3,300 m elevation. There is at least one subglacial water-filled cavity
                   under the central part of the glacier (Vincent et al., 2012), known as the main cavity of this glacier.
                   In 1892 (July 11), an outburst flood originated from the Tête-Rousse Glacier following collapse of an intraglacial
                   cavity. Around 200,000 m 3 of water and ice were released, dragging about 800,000 m 3 of sediments (boulders,
                   soil, and mud) into the village of Saint Gervais—Le Fayet. The catastrophic event caused 175 fatalities and
                   damaged multiple large infrastructures (Vincent et al., 2010). The mechanism controlling formation and growth
                   of the subglacial cavity has been clearly identified and is probably related to the glacier's thermal regime. Accord-
                   ing to Vincent et al., 2010), the cold tongue acts as a thermal barrier to water flow. At the time of the outburst
                   flood, factors combined to cause the collapse of the terminal tongue—due to a change in thermal regime (from
                   cold to temperate) or a positive anomaly of the mass balance.

                   Between 2009 and 2010, data were acquired on the Tête-Rousse Glacier from dense GPR and Surface Nuclear
                   Magnetic Resonance (SNMR) acquisitions. Their analysis revealed a new subglacial water-filled reservoir

                                          measuring 55,000 m 3 (±10,000 m 3) located at a depth of 40 m inside the glacier (Legchenko et al., 2014; Vincent
                                          et al., 2012). To prevent another potential outburst flood, the reservoir has been drained artificially (downhole
                                          pumps) several times—in 2010, 2011, and 2012—to prevent the cavity filling up again. In 2013, a large crevasse
                                          almost reaching the surface was detected, corresponding to the former cavity roof that collapsed during a pump in
                                          2012 (Vincent et al., 2015). The other few crevasses present on the glacier seem to be the main channel via which
                                          water runs into the cavity (Garambois et al., 2016).

                                          From SNMR surveys conducted in 2015 and 2018, no increase in the water content in the main cavity was
                                          detected. However, liquid water was detected at several points spread over the upper part of the glacier. These
                                          signals could be linked to a water-filled crevasse located upstream from the cavity together with a diffusive zone,
                                          revealed using GPR by Garambois et al. (2016) (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1). These observations
                                          suggest a zone where basal partial melting occurs (Gilbert et al., 2012). The glacier is thus in an unsteady state
                                          that requires to monitor both its water content and the cavity's geometry.
                                          The seismic acquisition presented in this paper was performed in 2022, from May 4 to 22. We deployed 60 Smart-
                                          Solo® three-component (3C) 5 Hz seismic nodes, in a grid pattern with approximately 30 m by 25 m spacing
                                          (Figure 1c). In addition, three 3C Trilium Compact PostHole ® 20s seismometers were installed (named C1 to
                                          C3, red dots in Figure 1c), forming a transversal profile, hence crossing the area above the expected main subgla-
                                          cial cavity (see Text S1 and Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1 for further experimental details).


                                          3. Data Analysis and Experimental Results
                                          We first performed a statistical analysis in the frequency domain for all the signals recorded by the seismic
                                          stations over the 20 days of experiment. Results show that the horizontal spectral components have a higher
                                          amplitude than the vertical component between 5 and 30 Hz. This is the case over almost the entire seismic array,
                                          as expected for glaciers (Preiswerk et al., 2019). HVSR peaks (see Figure 2a) are expected to reveal the glacier's
                                          vibration modes, as reported previously (Picotti et al., 2017; Preiswerk et al., 2019). Additional examples of
                                          power density spectrum (PSDs) plots for several sensors can be found in Text S2 in Supporting Information S1
                                          (Figures S2 and S3 in Supporting Information S1). Interestingly, the amplitude of the vertical component is
                                          higher than the amplitude of the horizontal component for some seismic sensors at specific frequencies, including
                                          sensor C2 located in the central part of the glacier above the expected main cavity (Figure 2b). Regions where
                                          the vertical component dominated (VHSR peaks above 1) are indicative of unusual impedance contrasts at depth,
                                          suggesting for instance the presence of cavities or ice/water-related contrasts.

                                          The first HVSR peak recorded by the C2 sensor and most of the nodes is at about 9 Hz (Figure 2a), whereas the
                                          first VHSR peak is at about 15 Hz (Figure 2b). We then analyzed how the seismic noise is polarized at these

                                        frequencies (see Text S3 in Supporting Information S1 for details). We derived the polarization attributes from
                                        singular value decompositions by applying Flinn's method (Flinn, 1965), using the seismic post-processing
                                        package Obspy. Our first-pass analysis, between 8 and 10 Hz, encompasses the first mode observed in the HVSR
                                        peak (see Figure S4 in Supporting Information S1). This analysis reveals high incidence values (often between
                                        75° and 90°), thus horizontal motion of the particle located in C2 in this frequency band. The correspond-
                                        ing azimuth values mostly ranges between 70° and 120° (E-W direction), indicating a longitudinally oriented
                                        horizontal particle motion, in agreement with the directivity of the HVSR peak near 9 Hz (Figure 2a) and the
                                        geometry of the glacier. HVSR peak frequency for all other sensors is close to 9 Hz (see Figure S5 in Supporting
                                        Information S1), with small variability mainly controlled by bedrock depth (Picotti et al., 2017). The azimuth's
                                        temporal variability is low, and is probably related to the natural variability of the wavefield propagating in the
                                        glacier.

                                        We then looked at the polarization attributes of the data encompassing the first VHSR peak (or HVSR trough)
                                        observed—between 14 and 16 Hz (Figure 2a). The seismic signal exhibits a mostly vertical motion of the particle
                                        located in C2 (highly variable but with a low incidence value, often between 10° and 50°). The correspond-
                                        ing azimuth values covered all directions, with consistently vertical polarization. The polarization analysis thus
                                        confirms our first observations from spectral analysis: the first HVSR peak around 9 Hz corresponds to a horizon-
                                        tal vibration mode along the glacier's main longitudinal axis, whereas the peak around 15 Hz revealed by VHSR
                                        peak is mostly in vertical mode. Polarization was stable throughout the duration of recording, adding support
                                        to our interpretation that these spectral peaks reflect natural vibration modes of the Tête-Rousse Glacier. These
                                        conclusions were further corroborated by the 3D mechanical modeling developed below.

                                        To better locate areas of vertical resonance all over the glacier, we computed the VHSR for each station over the
                                        whole time interval, from May 5 to May 21, using a modification of the hvsrpy Python tool (Vantassel, 2020).
                                        We then picked the maximum amplitude averaged over the azimuth within the 2–30 Hz frequency range, so as
                                        to focus only on first natural modes. Finally, using the ordinary-kriging method (based on a Matern model and
                                        a Matheron estimator), we interpolated the VHSR peak amplitude over the whole area covered by the seismic
                                        network (Figure 3). This analysis reveals a VHSR below 0.8 for most of the lower part of the glacier, whereas
                                        above the fourth line of nodes (see Figure 1c), the VHSR is slightly over 0.8. Moreover, two areas of the glacier
                                        were associated with VHSR peaks significantly exceeding 1 (around sensors C2 and 4.1). These areas are consist-
                                        ent with the location of the main subglacial cavity identified in 2010.

                                        In the following section, we describe how we built a simple mechanical 3D model of the glacier to reproduce
                                        these resonance modes and their polarization (vertical and horizontal).

                   4. Numerical Validation of Results
                   We performed direct numerical modeling based on finite-element analysis (FEA) to visualize vibrating modes
                   in the Tête-Rousse Glacier and to reconstruct the resonance frequencies along with their modal polarization. We
                   used COMSOL Multiphysics software (Comsol, 2023) for two purposes: (a) to perform modal analysis (MA) of
                   the glacier, solving eigenfrequencies of the 3D object to reproduce the fundamental mode of the whole glacier,
                   and (b) to determine the frequency response function (FRF) of a 2D axisymmetric model of a local area of the
                   glacier, retrieving the vertical displacements related to the presence of a cavity.


                   4.1. 3D Modeling of the Horizontal Glacier Mode

                   MA computes numerical eigenfrequencies of a solid structure and requires well-constrained structural knowledge
                   of the vibrating object. By combining all GPR and borehole measurements, Garambois et al. (2016) produced a
                   well-resolved estimation of the ice-bedrock interface's topography (see Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1).
                   For our model, we simplified the 3D geometry of the glacier to an ellipsoid-shaped ice block with dimensions
                   matching the field observations, lying on a rigid bedrock. Our modeled solid is composed of 94,000 quadratic
                   tetrahedral finite elements, with a maximum dimension of 15 m. We applied consistent boundary conditions to
                   mimic the configuration of the site: embedding the sides of the stable bedrock far from the glacier body, and
                   leaving the upper surface free. The mechanical parameters of both glacier and bedrock were estimated from the
                   literature for ice and fractured moraine (Sergeant et al., 2020; Table S1 in Supporting Information S1). For the
                   sake of simplicity, the properties of both glacier and bedrock were assumed to be homogeneous.

                   We found the first eigenfrequency, corresponding to the fundamental mode, to be at 9.42 Hz (Figure 4a), close to
                   the experimental HVSR peak measured at most nodes—at around 9 Hz (Figure 2a). This first mode is a flexural
                   mode polarized along the longest axis of the glacier (the longitudinal direction). The polarization of this first
                   numerical mode is consistent with the observed directivity of the 9 Hz HVSR peak measured by most of the seis-
                   mic sensors around the 100° azimuth. We noted that observed HVSR peak frequencies show a spatial variability
                   over the glacier (Figure S5 in Supporting Information S1), mainly depending on the local bedrock interface depth
                   and crevasses. We actually measured local “pseudo-modes” of compartments of the glacier, rather than a global
                   resonance of the whole glacier, due to the attenuation on the glacier that could not be addressed by the model.
                   Nevertheless, this 3D model suggests a longitudinal resonance around 9 Hz, similar to local horizontal modes
                   detected by HVSR peaks.

                   Overall, this MA validates to the first order the mechanical parameters set of the ice and the bedrock and our
                   interpretation of horizontal modes detected by HVSR. Then, a 2D modeling is needed to accurately interpretate
                   local vertical resonance modes detected by VHSR peaks.


                   4.2. 2D Modeling of the Cavity Mode

                   We then focused on the presence of a subglacial cavity to assess its effects on spectral analysis. For simplicity,
                   we used a 2D geometry with vertical axial symmetry, focusing on the central part of the glacier. We assumed the
                   simulated subglacial water-filled cavity to be elliptical, with realistic dimensions. We only constrained the bedrock
                   depth at 75 m and the location of the top of the cavity at around 35 m depth, in line with GPR measurements
                   obtained in 2022 (Figure 4b). Our 2D solid model was composed of 12,000 quadratic tetrahedral finite elements,
                   with a maximum size of 3 m side. A mesh refinement provided greater than 1% precision for all the mechanical
                   fields computed below 30 Hz (minimum of 20 elements per wavelength). Acoustoelastic coupling between liquid
                   water and ice was implemented by imposing continuous normal acceleration at the cavity interface. We simulated
                   ambient seismic sources by applying a linear harmonic loading between 5 and 20 Hz along a horizontal line
                   crossing the geometry. After computing the FRF, we retrieved the corresponding frequency-dependent response
                   displacement in the vertical direction at several points on the surface (closely reproducing the positions at which
                   seismic recordings were made by a vertical seismometer).

                   We compared the vertical displacements (along the Z-axis) obtained with and without the subglacial cavity in
                   Figure 4c. For a simulated sensor placed right above it, vertical vibrations has a clearly larger amplitude when the
                   cavity is present. In these conditions, the peak amplitude was two-fold that measured without the cavity, and has
                   a slightly different frequency.

                                          5. Discussion
                                          The aim of this study was to analyze ambient noise data from the Tête-Rousse Glacier to verify whether it could
                                          be used to detect and monitor subglacial cavities. Findings were confirmed by modeling. The results presented
                                          in Figure 3 identify two hotspots with high (above 1.1) VHSR amplitude peaks in the central part of the glacier.
                                          The first hotspot (centered around the C2 sensor) corresponds to the center of the main cavity first detected in
                                          2010, and confirmed in 2018 using GPR and by borehole drilling (Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1).
                                          The second one was measured only by node 4.1, which corresponds to the area above the 2010 cavity, but with a
                                          more limited lateral extension. This sensor was also the closest to a transversal crevasse identified on the glacier's
                                          right bank, known as the former roof of the cavity that collapsed in 2012 (Garambois et al., 2016). Note that this
                                          crevasse cannot explain the VHSR amplitude peak, since we expect an exacerbated horizontal energy increase at
                                          the border of the subvertical crack, due to shear vibration modes. However, this crevasse was previously shown
                                          to feed the cavity with surface water (Garambois et al., 2016). These recent observations may then result from a
                                          reshaping of the central cavity into two (or more) independent smaller cavities. Additional geophysical observa-
                                          tions will be required to confirm this hypothesis.

                                          Downward from the cavity line, the VHSR amplitude is always lower than 0.8 (Figure 3). This area corresponds
                                          to the cold part of the glacier (Garambois et al., 2016; Gilbert et al., 2012), where the basal ice temperature is
                                          always much lower than that of the melting point, so that the ice layer sticks to the underlying bedrock and no
                                          basal melting water is expected.

                                                  Geophysical Research Letters                                                                         10.1029/2023GL105038


                                             Upward from the cavity line, the VHSR amplitude generally stands between 0.8 and 1.1. This area is very well
                                             spatially correlated with the temperate area of the glacier (Garambois et al., 2016; Gilbert et al., 2012), where
                                             the basal ice temperature remains at the fusion point, allowing liquid water to emerge at the ice-bedrock inter-
                                             face, and some detachments to occur locally. Moreover, within the temperate ice, a large amount of liquid water
                                             was detected by SNMR (Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1). No large cavity containing liquid water has
                                             been revealed by GPR up to now, but small diffuse cavities filled with liquid water, or wet patches, may exist
                                             within this volume, generating slight vertical vibrations. These results confirm the general basal conditions of the
                                             glacier, as already suggested by GPR and SNMR surveys.

                                             The interpretation of VHSR amplitude has to be performed carefully, mainly due to the temporal variability of
                                             the seismic noise, the presence of body and surface waves in the wavefield, and local 2D or 3D resonance effects.
                                             In this study, threshold values delineating melting areas have been set with the help of prior information on
                                             Tête-Rousse Glacier. Hence, it is worth noting than VHSR amplitude values are site-dependent, and conclusions
                                             based on this proxy should not yet be definitive without additional information.

                                             It should also be noted that this seismic experiment was probably oversized: a shorter-lived, less intensive survey
                                             could have provided similar results. Statistical analysis of the temporal variability of the measurements will be
                                             the subject of further work, but at this point we estimate that only a few days of ambient noise data is required to
                                             conduct this type of experiment on glaciers. This duration might be decreased to a few hours through optimization
                                             of the data processing procedure. Among other advanced techniques, the extraction of Rayleigh wave ellipticity
                                             by DOP-E method (Berbellini et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2023) and its inversion may significantly improve the
                                             identification of englacial features (see Text S6 and Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1 for further details).


                                             6. Conclusion
                                             The spectral analysis performed on continuous seismic records acquired at the surface of the Tête-Rousse Glacier
                                             exhibits both a HVSR frequency peak and a polarization that corresponds to the first longitudinal mode of the
                                             glacier, confirming the elastic parameters of ice and bedrock. The VHSR exhibits a clear positive anomaly indi-
                                             cating the presence of a subglacial cavity (areas where VHSR >1.1) at a location that is consistent with the known
                                             position of the cavity. However, the VHSR mapping suggests that the cavity's geometry had been modified since
                                             previous observations, dating from 2010 to 2018. In addition, the upper part of the glacier, known to be composed
                                             of temperate ice, shows VHSR values close to 1, indicating a possible role for diffuse liquid water content and/
                                             or local detachment of the basal ice from the bedrock. These results indicate that ambient seismic noise-based
                                             spectral analysis of data collected by sensors at the surface can be used to map the presence of potential cavities
                                             in glaciers. Computing VHSR amplitude peaks is very straightforward, making this method accessible and rapid.
                                             But the level at which VHSR can detect cavities depends on the impedance contrast between the ice and the
                                             underlying layer (fractured or intact bedrock, sediments), and will need further investigation to be applicable on
                                             glaciers without prior information on their subglacial conditions.
