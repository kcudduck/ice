           Figure 8. Schematic for a water pocket caused by a thermal barrier. ‘CTS’ stands for cold-temperate transition surface. Below the firn and snow cover, the temperate ice is
           isolated from conductive cooling while the percolation and refreezing of water in the firn releases heat. In the firn-free area, conductive cooling is more effective, while melt
           water runs off superficially thus minimizing the heat transfer into the ice. The geometry of the water pocket is driven by the ice and water pressure, the latter being controlled
           by the subglacial hydraulic potential and the upslope water input.
