ABSTRACTT. Findelenoletseher, Switzerland. advanced about 250 m hetween 1979
and 1985, and retreated thereatter, Subglacial water pressure. surface velociy and surlace
atrain rate were determined at several sites, The measurements were made cavly in the
el seasons of 1980, 1962, 19685 and 1991 and in the antumm ol 1983 and the winter off
1981, Changes of surface geometry were assessed from aerial photographs
The estimated Dasal shear stress changed Tide henween 1982 and 1991 Nevertheless
Jaree changes in the relationship of subglacial water pressure and surlace velocity were
observed. which cannot he reconciled with the most commonly used shiding Taw unless it
is modificd substantiallv. Consideration of possible reasons indicates that a change in the
subelacial drainage svstem oceurred. probably involving hanee in the degree of cavity
interconmection. Isolated cavities damp the variations in siding velocine that normally
result from changes inwater pressure. bhecanse the pressure in isolated cavities decreases
as thesliding speed imereases, I contrast. by transiiting water-pressie uctuations o a
