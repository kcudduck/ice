                                   was carried out in the Swiss Alps using two different approaches: (1) kinematic analysis
                                   of specific active rock glaciers, and (2) description of the altitudinal distribution of relict
                                   rock glaciers. Two theoretical shape concepts of active rock-glacier morphology were de-

                                   Holocene climate variations.These results confirm the importance of Alpine rock glaciers
                                   as highly sensitive indicators of past temperature evolution.

           tions (Fig. 4). Muragl rock glacier can be viewed as a
           system of several creep lobes having different behaviour
           with respect to time and space, partially overriding each
           other and/or laterally interacting. Internal processes (flow
           instabilities, mass-deposition feedbacks) or external forcing
           (climate variations, variations in mass supply) can be hy-
           pothesized as the cause of such complex structures. In con-
           trast to the ``monomorphic'' type described above, this type
           of rock glacier is called ``polymorphic'' in our study.
               These two theoretical types differ not only in their
           velocity field and morphology, but also in their age structure,
           as estimated from streamlines interpolated from the velocity
           fields (Fig. 3, right). The assumption that the current
           velocities approximately equal a temporal average leads to
           the qualitative conclusion that the surface age of the indi-
           vidual lobes is younger (2^3 kyr) than on Murte©l (at least 4^
           5 kyr). The fact that Muragl rock glacier consists of several ver-
           tically overthrusting streams, and has a clearly less active lower
           part, suggests a much older age of the entire rock glacier than
           only a few kyr. Taking into account the variety of transverse
           surface structures on Muragl rock glacier, there is no clear
           sign of a creep continuum from the rock wall towards the in-
           dividual lobe fronts. Thus, in contrast to Murte©l rock glacier,

           Alpine permafrost reflects, initially, an interplay of tempera-

           The analysis of the spatial distribution of rock glaciers in the                 regional patterns of past permafrost distribution by applying
           Swiss Alps (Fig. 5) shows, not surprisingly, a pronounced al-                    this approach. They also indicate that thorough analyses at
           titudinal zonation: active rock glaciers occupy altitudinal                      individual relict rock glaciers would be a good way to gain
           bands between 2439 and 2878 m a.s.l., whereas the occur-                         more concise information about the depression and the local
           rence of relict rock glaciers is generally limited to heights                    variation of the past permafrost limit in the Alps.
           below 2556 m a.s.l., except for the Saas valley, where the
           mean altitude of the relict rock-glacier fronts is 2480 m a.s.l.,
           with a standard deviation of 211m. The group of inactive                        CONCLUSIONS
           rock glaciers, including both dynamically and climatically                       The results confirm the importance of rock glaciers as
           inactive ones, varies between these figures without exceed-
           ing the limit given by either the active or the relict objects.
           The mean elevation difference between currently active and
           inactive rock glaciers, of about 100 m or about 0.5³C, equals
           a temperature difference typical for Holocene climate vari-
           ations.While the mean standard deviation of the altitudinal
           zonation for active and inactive rock glaciers is in the order
           of 76 m, the distribution of the relict rock glaciers varies
           considerably, with a standard deviation of 263 m. This in-
           dicates quite stable climatic conditions for the active rock
           glaciers, in contrast to large climate variations and a long
           time-span for the relict rock glaciers. The present mean
           annual air temperature (Tp ), the hypothetical temperature
           Tlim and the resulting temperature difference (T ) for each
           region are plotted in Figure 6. The general pattern shows a
           wide range for T from 0.7³ to 5.3³C in the various regions.
           Even taking into account regional factors, such as topo-
           graphic preconditions, this indicates that some relict rock
           glaciers likely decayed at the end of the Alpine Late Glacial
           (e.g. Prëalps; Schoeneich,1998a), while others disintegrated
           during the Holocene.                                                                Fig. 6. Comparison of present mean annual air temperature
               Looking at the distribution pattern in Figure 5, the relict                     (Tp ) at relict rock-glacier fronts vs hypothetical mean annual
           rock glaciers in the Prëalps seem to have a different distribu-                    air temperature (Tlim ) if these relict rock glaciers were still at
           tion pattern than those in other regions. Therefore, different                      or close to the limit of discontinuous mountain permafrost.
           values for the variables are given as follows.The mean present                      T corresponds to the temperature increase between the pres-
           temperature (Tp ) at all relict rock glaciers included in the in-                   ent day and the time of the rock glacier's decay.
                                                                                                                                                                 285
