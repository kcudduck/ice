Abstract: An experimental study is conducted to find the characteristics of steam plume and pressure
oscillation on direct contact condensation by a side-hole sparger. Synchronal measuring of transient
pressure of the steam plume 1s gained from the high-speed camera and high-pressure sensor respectively.
The influence of steam mass flux and water temperature on direct contact condensation characteristic are
presented and its regime map 1s plotted. Then, the dynamic connections of transient pressure and steam
plume in different condensation regimes are analyzed. It is found that high frequency pressure oscillation
and the collapse of detached bubbles occur at the same time. Together with the condensing and
disappearing process of the collapse of detached bubbles, the intensity of pressure oscillation decays
exponentially in a vibration way. The changing trends of steam plume length in condensation oscillation
regime and stable condensation regime are also obtained, which shows that the steam plume increases with
the steam mass flux and the temperature in the condensation oscillation regime. When entering the stable
condensation regime, the steam plume suddenly decreases and then increases with the temperature and the
