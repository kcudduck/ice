Conclusions
Condensation oscillation of steam jet is of high importance for industrial facility. In
this paper, the generation mechanism and the propagation characteristic of the
second dominant frequency is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The main
results are summarized as follows:
(1) The second dominant frequencies are found to occur under all the test
condition. The second dominant frequency decreases with the rise of
water temperature and steam mass flux. Then the second dominant
frequency ...
