Condensation oscillation of steam jet is of high importance for industrial facility. In
this study, the mechanism and propagation characteristic of the second dominant
frequency is investigated. Firstly, the second dominant frequency 1s found under all
the test conditions based on frequency spectrum. The second dominant frequency
decreases with the rise of water temperature and steam mass flux. Then, the second
dominant frequency is proved to be generated by the separated steam bubbles
oscillation based on the bubble oscillation theory. And the theoretical oscillation
frequency equation of separated steam bubble is used to predict the second dominant
frequency, the predicted deviation ranges from â€”-17% to 6%. Furthermore, the
propagation characteristic of the second dominant frequency is investigated, and a
theoretical propagation equation for the second dominant frequency is derived. Then,
the axial and radial distribution characteristic of oscillation amplitude and energy of
the second dominant frequency are analyzed and researched. In the downstream flow
field and the radial direction, the propagation characteristic of steam bubble
oscillation wave is well corresponding to the predicted results. However, in the
upstream flow field, due to the effect of steam plume, the oscillation amplitude and
energy of the second dominant frequency attenuate rapidly and the experimental data
are much smaller than the predicted value.

Introduction

Steam jet condensation occurs widely in the industrial operation due to the high heat
transfer efficiency of steam-water direct contact condensation, such as the pressure
suppression (SP) system in boiling-water reactor, the in-containment refueling water
storage tank (IRWST) and the sparger in the advanced pressurized water reactor. In the
nuclear reactor, once the loss of coolant accident happens, the steam will flow through
the safety/relief valve and jet into the SP or IRWST through some spargers to keep the
nuclear reactor safety. Especially, for the pressure relief process in the boiling water
reactor, the steam is jetted into the pool in a relative stable condition at the initial
segment of steam release. When the steam is discharged for an extended period, the
pool temperature becomes high due to condensed steam, and the condensation
process might become unstable. Also, at the ending of steam release, the steam mass
flux reduces, and the condensation process would also become unstable.

Many investigations have been conducted on the direct contact condensation
experimentally and theoretically. Due to the high efficiency of heat transfer, a lot of
previous works have been devoted to the heat transfer characteristic [1], [2], [3], [4],
[5], 16], [7], [8]. It found that the heat transfer is closely associated with steam jet
pattern [3], [9], [10], [11], flow field parameter [3], [12], [13] and steam plume
