Highlights
* The second dominant frequency is found under all the test
condition.
* The second dominant frequency is proved to be generated by
separated steam bubbles.
* Theoretical propagation equations for the separated bubble
oscillation are obtained.
* Experimental data verify theoretical results in downstream and
radial flow field.
