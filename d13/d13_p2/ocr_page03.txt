characteristic [4], [14], [15]. Then the heat transfer coefficients of steam condensation
are evaluated with various models, such as the semi-empirical correlation, the
interfacial transport model, the surface renewal model, the shear stress model, the
small eddy model, and large eddy model. The heat transfer coefficient is found to be in
a range of 0.1-11MWm™K™' [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].

However, when steam is jetted into water and condensed by the water, the pressure
impulse 1s accompanied which is called the condensation oscillation. Generally, the
oscillation intension at unstable region is bigger than that at stable region. And the
condensation oscillation load may cause damage in the form of vibratory loads on the
wall and internal structures of the water tank. Especially, once the condensation
oscillation frequency is close to the resonance frequency of water tank or some other
equipment in the water tank, resonance effects occurs which would enhance the
damage to the water tank.

In order to prevent the damage of condensation oscillation, many attentions have
been paid to steam jet condensation for many years. Firstly, the unstable condensation
condition was investigated due to the large oscillations. Chan and Lee [16] investigated
the steam jet condensation with low mass flux. The oscillation jet, chugging and
bubble jet were observed. The oscillations were thought to be generated by the bubble
collapse. Youn et al. [17] found that the steam bubble detached from the nozzle exit
with obvious necking phenomenon, and obvious pressure pulses appeared when the
steam bubble detached. Simpson and Chan [1] made a further effort on the subsonic
jets. The motion of bubble growth, bubble translation, and bubble separation
(necking) occurred periodically. Coupled with the bubble motion process, pressure
pulse was appeared periodically. Based on the influence of water subcooling and
steam mass flux on the condensation frequency, a frequency correlation involving the
Jacob number and Reynold number was proposed which was widely adopted by later
researchers [18], [19]. Nar1ai and Aya [20] considered that pressure oscillation was
induced by the balance action between the supply of steam to steam cavity and its
condensation on the steam-water interface. They proposed three models of steam
bubble at condensation oscillation region to predict the condensation oscillation and
oscillation frequency. Fukuda [21] found that the shapes of steam cavity corresponded
to the condensation oscillation and condensation oscillation frequency was proportion
to water subcooling and inverse proportion to the nozzle diameter.

Moreover, according to the pressure relief process mentioned above, in the pressure
relief process, the steam jet with stable condensation will last a long time. Thus, the
oscillation in stable condensation region was investigated by some researchers. Hong
et al. [22] investigated the steam condensation oscillation at the condition of steam
