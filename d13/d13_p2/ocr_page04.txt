mass flux in the range of 300-900kgm™2s~! and the subcooled water temperature in
the range of 35-90°C. Based on the varying of steam jet length, a one-dimensional
oscillation model was proposed to predict the steam condensation oscillation
frequency and the predicted frequency well agreed with the dominant frequency they
measured. Qiu et al. [23], [24], [25] also investigated the pressure oscillation with
sonic and supersonic jets. The influence of steam mass flux, subcooled water
temperature and the design pressure ratio on the condensation oscillation frequency
was investigated. Besides the condensation oscillation frequency, another dominant
frequency was found in the frequency spectrum under some test conditions [24], as
shown in Fig. 1. And the frequency was higher than the condensation oscillation
frequency. To distinguish it from the condensation oscillation frequency, the higher
dominant frequency was named as the second dominant frequency.

From the above, the investigation on the condensation oscillation mainly focuses on
condensation oscillation region, and the attention on the stable condensation region is
not so much. Furthermore, although the second dominant frequency has been found
under some test conditions, the basic information is still indistinct, such as the
characteristic and generating mechanism of the second dominant frequency. In
addition, for some conditions, the oscillation amplitude of the second dominant
frequency is higher than that of the first dominant frequency based on the report of
Qiu et al. [24].

Moreover, according to the wave theory, the condensation oscillation intension would
be decayed by the water when the oscillation wave travels in the water. Also, the
intensity of impact load would change with the distance between the condensation
oscillation position and internal structures of the water tank. Therefore, the
condensation oscillation load on the water tank would be different when the water
tank size and structure change. So, the investigation on the propagation character of
pressure oscillation is significant to the design of water tank and pressure relief pool.
To investigate the pressure oscillation propagation, the theory of sound wave
propagation can be used as the theoretical basis.

According to the acoustic analogy theory proposed by Lighthill [26], flow field can be
divided into near-field and far-field. The near-field is the sound source area and the
far-field is the sound propagation area. With the information of sound source, the
sound propagation characteristic can be obtained with the Lighthill equation.
Furthermore, based on the acoustic emission characteristic, the sound source can be
divided into quadrupole source, dipole source and monopole source. Especially, when
the sound is generated by the fluid mass flux change caused by the fluid compression
and expansion, the sound source is called the monopole source. Based on the
