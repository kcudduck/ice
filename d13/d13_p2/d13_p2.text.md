Condensation oscillation of steam jet is of high importance for industrial facility. In this study, the mechanism and propagation characteristic of the second dominant frequency is investigated. Firstly, the second dominant frequency is found under all the test conditions based on frequency spectrum. The second dominant frequency decreases with the rise of water temperature and steam mass flux. Then, the second dominant frequency is proved to be generated by the separated steam bubbles oscillation based on the bubble oscillation theory. And the theoretical oscillation frequency equation of separated steam bubble is used to predict the second dominant frequency, the predicted deviation ranges from   − 17% to 6%. Furthermore, the propagation characteristic of the second dominant frequency is investigated, and a theoretical propagation equation for the second dominant frequency is derived. Then, the axial and radial distribution characteristic of oscillation amplitude and energy of the second dominant frequency are analyzed and researched. In the downstream flow field and the radial direction, the propagation characteristic of steam bubble oscillation wave is well corresponding to the predicted results. However, in the upstream flow field, due to the effect of steam plume, the oscillation amplitude and energy of the second dominant frequency attenuate rapidly and the experimental data are much smaller than the predicted value. Introduction Steam jet condensation occurs widely in the industrial operation due to the high heat transfer efficiency of steam–water direct contact condensation, such as the pressure suppression (SP) system in boiling-water reactor, the in-containment refueling water storage tank (IRWST) and the sparger in the advanced pressurized water reactor. In the nuclear reactor, once the loss of coolant accident happens, the steam will flow through the safety/relief valve and jet into the SP or IRWST through some spargers to keep the nuclear reactor safety. Especially, for the pressure relief process in the boiling water reactor, the steam is jetted into the pool in a relative stable condition at the initial segment of steam release. When the steam is discharged for an extended period, the pool temperature becomes high due to condensed steam, and the condensation process might become unstable. Also, at the ending of steam release, the steam mass flux reduces, and the condensation process would also become unstable. Many investigations have been conducted on the direct contact condensation experimentally and theoretically. Due to the high efficiency of heat transfer, a lot of previous works have been devoted to the heat transfer characteristic [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. It found that the heat transfer is closely associated with steam jet pattern [3], [9], [10], [11], flow field parameter [3], [12], [13] and steam plume  Experimental   and   theoretical   study   on   the   sec...   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article... 2   of   9   27/09/2025,   17:48

characteristic [4], [14], [15]. Then the heat transfer coefficients of steam condensation are evaluated with various models, such as the semi-empirical correlation, the interfacial transport model, the surface renewal model, the shear stress model, the small eddy model, and large eddy model. The heat transfer coefficient is found to be in a range of 0.1–11MWm   K   [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, when steam is jetted into water and condensed by the water, the pressure impulse is accompanied which is called the condensation oscillation. Generally, the oscillation intension at unstable region is bigger than that at stable region. And the condensation oscillation load may cause damage in the form of vibratory loads on the wall and internal structures of the water tank. Especially, once the condensation oscillation frequency is close to the resonance frequency of water tank or some other equipment in the water tank, resonance effects occurs which would enhance the damage to the water tank. In order to prevent the damage of condensation oscillation, many attentions have been paid to steam jet condensation for many years. Firstly, the unstable condensation condition was investigated due to the large oscillations. Chan and Lee [16] investigated the steam jet condensation with low mass flux. The oscillation jet, chugging and bubble jet were observed. The oscillations were thought to be generated by the bubble collapse. Youn et al. [17] found that the steam bubble detached from the nozzle exit with obvious necking phenomenon, and obvious pressure pulses appeared when the steam bubble detached. Simpson and Chan [1] made a further effort on the subsonic jets. The motion of bubble growth, bubble translation, and bubble separation (necking) occurred periodically. Coupled with the bubble motion process, pressure pulse was appeared periodically. Based on the influence of water subcooling and steam mass flux on the condensation frequency, a frequency correlation involving the Jacob number and Reynold number was proposed which was widely adopted by later researchers [18], [19]. Nariai and Aya [20] considered that pressure oscillation was induced by the balance action between the supply of steam to steam cavity and its condensation on the steam–water interface. They proposed three models of steam bubble at condensation oscillation region to predict the condensation oscillation and oscillation frequency. Fukuda [21] found that the shapes of steam cavity corresponded to the condensation oscillation and condensation oscillation frequency was proportion to water subcooling and inverse proportion to the nozzle diameter. Moreover, according to the pressure relief process mentioned above, in the pressure relief process, the steam jet with stable condensation will last a long time. Thus, the oscillation in stable condensation region was investigated by some researchers. Hong et al. [22] investigated the steam condensation oscillation at the condition of steam  − 2   − 1  Experimental   and   theoretical   study   on   the   sec...   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article... 3   of   9   27/09/2025,   17:48

mass flux in the range of 300–900kgm   s   and the subcooled water temperature in the range of 35–90   °C. Based on the varying of steam jet length, a one-dimensional oscillation model was proposed to predict the steam condensation oscillation frequency and the predicted frequency well agreed with the dominant frequency they measured. Qiu et al. [23], [24], [25] also investigated the pressure oscillation with sonic and supersonic jets. The influence of steam mass flux, subcooled water temperature and the design pressure ratio on the condensation oscillation frequency was investigated. Besides the condensation oscillation frequency, another dominant frequency was found in the frequency spectrum under some test conditions [24], as shown in Fig. 1. And the frequency was higher than the condensation oscillation frequency. To distinguish it from the condensation oscillation frequency, the higher dominant frequency was named as the second dominant frequency. From the above, the investigation on the condensation oscillation mainly focuses on condensation oscillation region, and the attention on the stable condensation region is not so much. Furthermore, although the second dominant frequency has been found under some test conditions, the basic information is still indistinct, such as the characteristic and generating mechanism of the second dominant frequency. In addition, for some conditions, the oscillation amplitude of the second dominant frequency is higher than that of the first dominant frequency based on the report of Qiu et al. [24]. Moreover, according to the wave theory, the condensation oscillation intension would be decayed by the water when the oscillation wave travels in the water. Also, the intensity of impact load would change with the distance between the condensation oscillation position and internal structures of the water tank. Therefore, the condensation oscillation load on the water tank would be different when the water tank size and structure change. So, the investigation on the propagation character of pressure oscillation is significant to the design of water tank and pressure relief pool. To investigate the pressure oscillation propagation, the theory of sound wave propagation can be used as the theoretical basis. According to the acoustic analogy theory proposed by Lighthill [26], flow field can be divided into near-field and far-field. The near-field is the sound source area and the far-field is the sound propagation area. With the information of sound source, the sound propagation characteristic can be obtained with the Lighthill equation. Furthermore, based on the acoustic emission characteristic, the sound source can be divided into quadrupole source, dipole source and monopole source. Especially, when the sound is generated by the fluid mass flux change caused by the fluid compression and expansion, the sound source is called the monopole source.

Lighthill’s acoustic analogy theory, sound propagation characteristic in the flow field was investigated by many scholars [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Willians and Hawkings [30] proposed an equation to investigate the sound propagation characteristic with a motion sound source and the equation was solved by Farassat [31]. Goldstein [32] investigated the propagation characteristic in the motion flow field and proposed a generalized Lighthill equation. Due to the lack of investigation on the second dominant frequency, the characteristic and generating mechanism of the second dominant frequency will be investigated in the present study with help of high speed camera and dynamic pressure sensors. Furthermore, the propagation characteristic of the second dominant frequency would be explored by taking the theory of aerodynamic sound as reference. The understanding of the second dominant frequency and its propagation characteristics will be useful to the design of the direct contact condensation system and steam- driven jet injector. Also, the experimental results can be used to verify the calculation results. Section snippets Experimental apparatus The experimental system of submerged steam jet in quiescent water is showed in Fig. 2. It is same to the experimental system of Qiu et al. [24]. It mainly constructs with a steam generator (the maximum steam mass output is 0.4th   ), a water tank (3000   ×   1200   ×   2000   mm), an electric control valve and a mass flow meter (0.5% full span). The nozzle inlet pressure and temperature are measured with a pressure transducer (0.1% full span) and a T-type thermocouple (±0.5   °C), respectively. The tank water … The second dominant frequency When steam is jetted into the subcooled water, the condensation oscillation occurs. With the high frequency dynamic pressure sensors, the condensation oscillation pressure is obtained. However, the dynamic characteristic of condensation oscillation pressure is known to be extremely complex and strong randomness. Thus the FFT is adopted to deal with the random signal. Fig. 6 shows the frequency spectrograms transformed with FFT for different test condition.
