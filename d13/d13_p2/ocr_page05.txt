Lighthill's acoustic analogy theory, sound propagation characteristic in the flow field
was investigated by many scholars [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Willians and
Hawkings [30] proposed an equation to investigate the sound propagation
characteristic with a motion sound source and the equation was solved by Farassat
[31]. Goldstein [32] investigated the propagation characteristic in the motion flow
field and proposed a generalized Lighthill equation.

Due to the lack of investigation on the second dominant frequency, the characteristic
and generating mechanism of the second dominant frequency will be investigated in
the present study with help of high speed camera and dynamic pressure sensors.
Furthermore, the propagation characteristic of the second dominant frequency would
be explored by taking the theory of aerodynamic sound as reference. The
understanding of the second dominant frequency and its propagation characteristics
will be useful to the design of the direct contact condensation system and steam-
driven jet injector. Also, the experimental results can be used to verify the calculation
results.

Experimental apparatus

The experimental system of submerged steam jet in quiescent water 1s showed in Fig.
2. It 1s same to the experimental system of Qiu et al. [24]. It mainly constructs with a
steam generator (the maximum steam mass output is 0.4th™1), a water tank
(3000%x1200%x2000mm), an electric control valve and a mass flow meter (0.5% full
span). The nozzle inlet pressure and temperature are measured with a pressure
transducer (0.1% full span) and a T-type thermocouple (£0.5°C), respectively. The tank
water ...

The second dominant frequency

When steam is jetted into the subcooled water, the condensation oscillation occurs.
With the high frequency dynamic pressure sensors, the condensation oscillation
pressure 1s obtained. However, the dynamic characteristic of condensation oscillation
pressure 1s known to be extremely complex and strong randomness. Thus the FFT is
adopted to deal with the random signal. Fig. 6 shows the frequency spectrograms
transformed with FFT for different test condition. There are two obvious dominant ...
