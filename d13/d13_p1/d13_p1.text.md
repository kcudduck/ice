As for the numerical experiment, a series of sensitivity calculations was conducted system- atically to elucidate the major factors which can cause different analysis results by varying the mesh distributions, numerical models for a convection term and an eddy viscosity term. The effect of a differ- ence in the velocity and the temperature distribution in a region between the sparger and the pool wall has not been observed in the afore-mentioned sensitivity calculations. The comparison of the CFD results with the test data shows that the CFD analysis does not accurately simulate the local phenomenon of a turbulent jet existing downstream of a steam jet. It was found that the value of the turbulent intensity at the inlet of the turbulent jet region is the most important factor because it can determine the boundary of a turbulent jet through a momentum diffusion process in a radial direction. The comparison of the CFD results with the test data shows that the CFD analysis can accurately simulate the local phenomenon of a turbulent jet existing downstream of a steam jet only when the CFD analysis reflects the physics of a turbulent jet.  © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction  The experimental and CFD research for a direct contact con- densation (DCC) of an unstable steam jet which may happen in the IRWST (In-containment Refuelling Water Storage Tank) of   APR1400   (Advanced   Power   Reactor   1400 MWe)   were   per- formed to understand the phenomenon of a DCC (Song et al., 1998, 2007). One of the main reasons for an unstable condensa- tion was found to be the increased temperature of a turbulent water jet entraining on a steam jet region (Su, 1981). Thus, a thermal mixing test to discharge steam through a sparger into a subcooled water was performed recently to investigate the local temperature of the pool water around a sparger (Park et al., 2005, 2007). The CFD analysis using the so-called conden- sation region model for the thermal mixing test was conducted to   develop   a   methodology   which   can   be   applied   to   a   safety  ∗   Corresponding author at: KAERI, Thermal Hydraulics Safety Research Division, Daedeok-daero 1045, Yuseong, Daejeon 305-353, Republic of Korea.

This analysis shows that a commercial CFD code with this condensation region model can be used to analyze the overall pool behavior if a suffi- ciently fine mesh distribution and a proper numerical model are adopted. The thermal-hydraulic load onto the IRWST wall was also eval- uated for each phase of a water, air and steam discharge through a sparger (Park et al., 2005; Ra, 1999). In the dynamic load analysis of the steam discharge phase, the maximum velocity, temperature and the width of the turbulent water jet induced by the condens- ing steam jet were used as the input data (Ra, 1999). It seems to be very useful for the evaluation of a thermal-hydraulic load if an empirical correlation to accurately predict the velocity and temperature of a turbulent water jet is developed. Recently, there- fore, a fundamental test to measure the velocity and temperature distribution of a turbulent jet during a steam discharge through a single-hole sparger into a subcooled water pool was performed to develop these correlations (Kim and Youn, 2008). However, the velocity and temperature was not measured at the upstream region of a turbulent jet existing downstream of a steam jet because the used measurement device might disturb the turbulent jet behav- ior. Also, a far-field region away from the turbulent jet was also not 0029-5493/$ – see front matter   © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.  doi:10.1016/j.nucengdes.2009.11.026

A commercial code, the CFX-11 (ANSYS Inc., 2007) was intro- duced in this study to assist in the development of the correlations to accurately predict the velocity and temperature of a turbulent water jet based on the validation work of the CFX-11 against the measured data near a steam jet region. It would also be very help- ful for understanding the effect of a steam jet condensation on a turbulent jet by comparing the measurements of the velocity and temperature distribution with those data predicted by a theory for the single phase turbulent jet (Abramovich, 1963).  2.   The turbulent jet solution by a theory  The solution from a turbulent jet theory regarding the velocity and temperature distribution can be used meaningfully as refer- ence data to define the hydrodynamic values at the inlet boundary of a turbulent jet region when a CFD analysis is applied to pre- dict a whole mixing flow region, except for the steam jet region, and its results are compared with the measurements. The theory of Tollmien’s axi-symmetric source (Abramovich, 1963) has been  Table 1  Similarity method for Tollmien’s theory (Abramovich, 1963).

This theory assumes that the turbulent jet flow starts from the point source and some of the axial flow moves upward due to the turbulent shear stress while the turbulent jet propagates axially. The method of a similarity (Table 1) was intro- duced to solve the Tollmien’s model, and the obtained solutions for the flow field and heat transfer can be presented in dimensionless forms, as shown in Fig. 1, depending on the coefficient of ‘ a ’ related to a mixing length model (Abramovich, 1963; Chung, 2005).  3.   Experiments for a turbulent jet  3.1.   Experimental facility  The GIRLS facility with a single-hole sparger (Fig. 2) submerged in a subcooled water tank was used for the experiment of a turbu- lent jet induced by a condensing steam jet (Song et al., 2007). The diameter of the single hole on the tip of the sparger is 1 cm. Steam produced in the steam boiler is provided from the boiler to a single- hole sparger. During this discharge, the temperature, pressure and mass flow rates of the steam are measured, and the measured tem- perature and pressure inside the sparger provide the information on the discharged steam. The pool water temperature is estimated by averaging the temperature signals from the 6 Thermocouples (TCs) located near the wall, inside the pool. In order to measure the velocity and temperature distribution of a turbulent jet with- out disturbing the shape of the jet flow, a movable spool of a Pitot tube and a TC combination was introduced to provide information on the velocity and temperature simultaneously along the axial and radial directions. The geometric information on the measurement spool is shown in detail in Fig. 2.  3.2.   Experimental matrix  The experiment for a turbulent jet was performed to character- ize the stable condensation region under a quasi-steady state by discharging a steam jet of about 1000 kg/m 2   s into a lower temper- ature water in a tank (Kim et al., 2005). In order to observe the effect of the pool water temperature on the turbulent jet, five cases were selected as shown in Table 2. The measurement spool is continually moved to measure the velocity and temperature of the turbulent jet in the radial direction at the same axial location. The axial measure- ment location is defined as the horizontal distance from the exit of a single discharging hole to the measurement location. The radial measurement location is defined as the vertical distance at the same axial location, and the radial measurement location is increased by 0.25 cm from the center of the turbulent jet. The total number of locations is 122 points, and the duration of a measurement at one location is about 4 s. While manually moving the measurements spool, the temperature of the pool water is increased up to 10–20% of the initial temperature due to the energy of the discharged steam (Table 2). The uncertainty of each measurement device is shown in Table 3.

Experimental results and discussion  Fig. 3 shows the trend of the velocity decay at the jet centerline. This is because the width of the jet is increased as the turbulent jet propagates downstream along the axial direction. This flow pattern is very similar to that of a single phase jet. In Fig. 3, the velocity val- ues at the axial locations of 12, 16 and 20 cm, normalized by the values measured at 8 cm, are shown and compared with the veloc- ity value predicted by the relation of   U m   / U o   in Table 1 based on Tollmien’s theory. During the normalization process, the depen- dency of the coefficient of ‘ a ’, which is a measure of the mixing length in the turbulence model, disappear. The predicted values by Tollmien’s theory are less than about 10% of the test results.  Table 3  Information on the instrumentations.

H.S. Kang, C.-H. Song / Nuclear Engineering and Design   240 (2010) 2160–2168   2163  It is noted that the point of the turbulent source in the theory is assumed to be located at the center point of a single discharge hole of the sparger. In order to elucidate the effect of a condensing steam jet on the turbulent jet, it is necessary to evaluate the spreading width of a turbulent jet quantitatively by comparing it with the value of a sin- gle phase turbulent jet predicted by Tollmien’s theory, because a liquid entrainment into a steam jet region from the surrounding pool water may increase the jet width of a turbulent jet. It was also observed that the diameter of the vapor core in the steam jet was expanded to 1.63 times that of a discharging hole while the steam jet propagates with an ellipsoidal shape under a steam mass flux of about 1000 kg/m 2   s (Kim et al., 2001). The comparison of the nor- malized radial velocity of the test results with Tollmien’s theory at the axial locations of 8, 12, 16 and 20 cm are shown in Fig. 4. The coefficients for ‘ a ’ (defined in Table 1) relevant to the spreading of a single phase jet are recommended to be 0.066, 0.070 and 0.076 from the theory (Abramovich, 1963). From our comparisons, how- ever, the velocity distribution predicted using these values of the  a -coefficient does not agree well with the test results as shown in Fig. 4, whereas the theory’s solutions predict the test results well when the coefficient of   a   = 0.082 is used instead. This indicates that the extent of the radial spreading of a turbulent jet induced by a condensing steam jet is about 10–25% larger than that of a single phase turbulent jet induced by the effect of an entrainment and expansion phenomena. The radial distribution of the normalized temperature is com- pared between the test results and Tollmien’s theory using the coefficient of ‘ a ’ in (Fig. 5) at each axial location of 8, 12, 16 and 20 cm. At 8 cm, the values predicted by Tollmien’s theory with “ a   = 0.082” agreed well with the test data, whereas the predicted values are lower than the test data at 12, 16 and 20 cm. It can be deduced that these differences may be mainly caused by using increased values of the average pool water temperature ( T ∞ ) which was used for the normalization process of the test data along the radial direction at each axial location. In the experiments, the tem- perature difference,    T m   (= T m   −   T ∞ ), measured at the jet centerline was decreased due to an increase of the average   T ∞   when compared to the instant temperature of   T ∞   measured at the jet centerline. In the case of the local temperature difference of    T   (= T ( x ,   y )   −   T ∞ ), the situation is reversed: it is clear that the difference between the local measurement of the water temperature at each radial direc- tion and the average pool water temperature is smaller at 16 and 20 cm than at 8 cm. It is expected, from the fact that the comparison of the velocity results at those axial locations shows a good agree- ment, that the dimensionless temperature distributions at 12, 16 and 20 cm will agree well with the values predicted by Tollmien’s theory using a constant value of the pool water temperature. The velocity and temperature distributions inside the turbulent jet along the radial direction at each axial location can be estimated when using Tollmien’s theory with a value of   a   = 0.082. However, the maximum velocity ( U m   ), predicted by Tollmien’s theory, exist- ing along the centerline of a turbulent jet cannot be obtained easily because of the steam condensation phenomenon: in this turbulent jet region, the velocity of the condensed water at a downstream part is less than 5% that of the steam velocity at the end of a steam jet region due to that fact that the water density is about 1000 times larger than that of the steam. Therefore, a correlation to predict the maximum velocity at a jet centerline is proposed as Eq. (1), which can be calculated with the help of a previous correlation and the test data (Del Tin et al., 1983; Kang and Song, 2008). The error of this correlation is less than   ± 10%.

Comparison of the measured temperatures in the radial direction with Tollmien’s theory (average   T ∞   of Case-1–Case-5 = 15.7, 27.8, 31.7, 36.8 and 39.3   ◦   C). In Eq. (1), “ y c   ” is the characteristic length in the radial direction from the jet centerline to the location at 50% of the   U m   . In general,  y c   is dependent on the axial distance from the discharging nozzle exit in a single phase jet, whereas   y c   for the turbulent jet induced by a condensing steam may vary depending on the condition of steam properties and the pool water temperature. Thus, a new variable of ‘ x   −   L ’, of which the physical meaning is the length between the end of a steam jet penetration length ( L ) (Kim et al., 2001) and the measured location ( x ) along the axial location, is introduced to account for the effect of the steam mass flux and the pool water temperature. The correlation for   y c   , defined by Eq. (2), using the new variable was developed with an error of   ± 10% based on the test results (Kang and Song, 2008). And a correlation for the maximum temperature (Eq. (3)) at the jet centerline, based simply on the test results, was also proposed and the error of this correlation was about   ± 20%. The correlations for the velocity and temperature distributions of a turbulent jet at the centerline were developed based on our measured data along the axial locations of only 8–20 cm away from the exit of the steam discharge hole. In order to apply these cor- relations to other regions outside the measurement region, the correlations should be validated against the test results by per- forming some supplementary tests. In the experiments, however, the turbulent jet may be disturbed if a Pitot tube-TC spool moves closer to the exit of a steam discharge hole to measure the veloc- ity and temperature distributions. In this study, therefore, the CFD  Fig. 6.   Axi-symmetric grid model.

CFD analysis  4.1.   Modeling strategy and grid model  CFD codes can be used as tools to investigate the applicabil- ity of existing semi-analytical correlations to predict the velocity and temperature distribution in a turbulent water jet produced by a condensing steam jet discharged into a water pool. The test case selected for the CFD validation is Case-3 in Table 2. First of all, the local velocity distributions at the axial locations of   x   = 8–12 cm were compared carefully with the test results before proceeding to comparing the temperature distributions because the heat transfer enhancement due to the turbulence effect is calculated in the anal- ysis based on the velocity results estimated by using the Reynolds analogy concept implemented in the CFX-11. According to the pre- vious CFD analysis results (Kang and Song, 2008) and the best practice guidelines proposed by OECD/NEA (Bestion et al., 2007), it was observed that the prediction of a turbulent jet behavior in a subcooled water pool is mainly dependent on the mesh distri- bution, the discretization method of the convection term and the turbulent model selected for use. And it has also been reported that the experimental result of a turbulent jet (Van Wissen et al., 2005) showed that the turbulent intensity measured inside the jet boundary was about 3 times larger than that of a single phase jet. Therefore, a sensitivity calculation by considering these factors including the turbulent intensity has been performed to evaluate the uncertainty of the CFD analysis results. The CFD analysis for the turbulent jet considered in our experi- ments has to be made as a transient state because the local thermal mixing pattern of the pool water is qualitatively proportional to the discharged duration of a steam jet. However, it is difficult to simu- late a whole period of a steam discharge in the test, and the local velocity and temperature behaviors at   x   = 8–16 cm may not be so sensitively dependent on the steam discharge time. So a transient calculation of 10 s with a time step of 0.001 s has been performed in the present analysis. A denser cells distribution inside the jet boundary is usually recommended to obtain a well-converged solu- tion of a jet flow in a CFD analysis (Kang and Song, 2008; Yoon and Park, 2007). Therefore, an axi-symmetric grid model with a fine mesh distribution, as shown in Fig. 6, was introduced because the turbulent jet behavior can be treated as axi-symmetric with regard to the center of a single hole, and this model can save on the com- putational time. In the grid model, the flow region (“B” in Fig. 6) from a single discharge hole to an axial location of 8 cm and also with a diameter of 4 cm in the radial direction inside the boundary of the steam and turbulent jet regions has been excluded from the computational domain in order to start the CFD calculation from a turbulent jet at 8 cm, and the inlet condition is provided both from the test data and Tollmien’s theory at 8 cm. The purpose of this modeling is first to evaluate the CFD results against the test results at the axial locations from 8 to 16 cm before applying the CFD calculation approach adopted in this region into other regions. In order to evaluate the uncertainty of the CFD results due to the mesh distribution, a sensitivity calculation was set up as shown in Table 4, which includes a numerical model of the convection term, a turbulent model and an entrainment model (Kang and Song, 2008).  4.2.   Boundary conditions and governing equations  As for the inlet boundary condition (ANSYS Inc., 2007), the Dirichlet condition was set at the axial location of 8 cm with a length of 4 cm in the radial direction (Fig. 6) with the velocity and temper- ature distributions as shown in Fig. 7. The values of the turbulent intensities at the inlet of the calculation region were set as a 10% intensity of the mean velocity except for Case-6. The 10% of turbu- lent intensity, which is the maximum value of users’ input option  generally recommended by commercial CFD codes , was used accord- ing to our previous research (Kim et al., 2005) where we found that the turbulence fluctuation generated by the steam injected through small holes seems to be very high   when compared to a general steam jet . In Case-6, however, the 40% of turbulent intensity was assumed because the eddy motions are very strongly when a steam jet is  Fig. 7.   Inlet boundary conditions.

Velocity, temperature and velocity distributions of Case-1 at 7, 8, 9 and 10 s. discharged into a pool water. As for the pressure outlet boundary condition (ANSYS Inc., 2007), the Neumann condition was set for the upper free surface of the pool region, which only allows an out- flow of air. A symmetry condition was applied to the center of the sparger. Thermal mixing phenomenon in a subcooled water pool was treated as an incompressible flow, a free air surface over the pool water, a turbulent flow, and a buoyancy flow. Therefore, the govern- ing equations used in this study are the Navier–Stokes and energy equations with a homogenous multi-fluid model under a coupled algorithm (ANSYS Inc., 2007). The turbulent flow is simulated by the standard   k – ε   turbulent model (Eqs. (4)–(6)) and the shear stress transport (Eqs. (7)–(9)), and the buoyancy is modeled by the Boussi- nesq approximation. As for the numerical model for the convection term, the first-order upwind ( ˇ   = 0 in Eq. (10)) and the high resolu- tion model are used ( ˇ   = 1 in Eq. (10)). In the homogenous model, the inter-phase mass and heat transfer are neglected. Each trans- port quantity in the governing equations except for the volume fraction is summed over all the phases to provide a single transport quantity. As for the calculation method, 10 iterations are performed with a time step of 0.001 s until the mass, enthalpy, and velocity residual of the water reach below a value of 1.0E − 04, except for the enthalpy of Case-2.  ∂k ∂t   +   U j ∂k ∂x j  =   P k   −   ε   +   ∂ ∂x j  [ (     +    t  k  )   ∂k ∂x j  ]  (4)  ∂ε ∂t   +   U j ∂ε ∂x j  =   C   ε 1  ε k  P k   −   C ε 2  ε 2  k   +   ∂ ∂x j  [ (     +    t ε  )   ∂ε ∂x j  ]  (5)   t   =   C   k 2  ε   (6)  ∂k ∂t   +   U j ∂k ∂x j  =   P k   −   ˇ ′ kω   +   ∂ ∂x j  [(     +   ω    t ∂k ∂x j  )]  (7)  ∂ω ∂t   +   U j ∂ω ∂x j  =   ˛S 2   −   ˇ 3 ω   +   ∂ ∂x j  [(     +   ω    t ∂k ∂x j  )]  +   2(1   −   F 1   )   ω  1  ω ∂k ∂x j ∂ω ∂x j  (8)   t   =   a 1 k  max( a 1 ω, SF 2   )   (9)  ip   =   up   +   ˇ ∇   ·     r   (10)  4.3.   Discussion on the CFD results  The time dependency of the CFD results should be checked before comparing the CFD results of the transient state with the test results of the quasi-steady state. The velocity, temperature and the normalized velocity distributions in the radial and axial direc- tions for Case-1 at   t   = 7, 8, 9 and 10 s are shown in Fig. 8. From the CFD results, it is observed that the local phenomena at the region between the nozzle exit and the pool wall does not depend on the simulation time except for the average temperature of the pool water. And the turbulent jet discharged from the nozzle exit prop- agates until a half length of the radius of the pool and then slightly moves upwardly due to a buoyancy force and a re-circulation flow is developed at the bottom region. The comparison of the normalized velocity distributions along the radial direction at different axial locations of   x   = 12 and 16 cm also shows that the time dependency could be neglected. Therefore, the CFD results at 10 s have been selected for their comparison with the test results. The CFD sensitivity results (Case-1–Case-5) show that the veloc- ity difference in the radial direction (Fig. 9(a)) due to the mesh distribution, the numerical model for the convection term and the turbulent model is less than 5%. This may come from the fact that the location for the comparison of the CFD results is a region away from the tank wall, where the direction of the jet flow does not change even due to its collision with the wall. However, a veloc- ity difference of 30–40% has been found when comparing the CFD

This may be caused by the circulation flow that forms around the turbulent jet region (“A” in Fig. 10(a)) which reduces the momentum diffusion in the radial direction in this region, and also the lower velocity region existing at the upper (“B” in Fig. 10(a)) and the lower (“C” in Fig. 10(a)) -regions near the nozzle exit region are entrained by a higher velocity region at the central jet region (“D” in Fig. 10(a)).

Song / Nuclear Engineering and Design   240 (2010) 2160–2168  is not observed at the velocity profile of Case-6 (Fig. 10(b)), and also the calculated velocity profile in the radial direction shows a good agreement with the test data within a 10% difference. This may be because the inlet condition of Case-6 simulates the physics of turbulent jet much better than in the other cases. A high turbulent intensity value (30–40%) of the mean velocity around the turbulent jet has been reported based on experimental results (Van Wissen et al., 2005). Additionally it is noted that a turbulent intensity at the inlet region of the turbulent jet region may enlarge the jet width by a momentum diffusion process along the radial direction. According to the comparison of the temperature (Fig. 9(b)) between the analysis and tests, only the CFD results only for Case- 6 can predict the test data reasonably well because the turbulent temperature field is calculated from the velocity results by using the turbulent Prandtl number in the CFD analysis (ANSYS Inc., 2007). However, further discussion on the comparison of the temperature between the CFD results and the test data is not achievable because the average pool water temperature was varied during a steam jet discharge in the experiments, and the data of the CFD results and the test data for the present comparison was not obtained at the same time. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that, in princi- ple, the Reynolds analogy is basically valid only to flow near the wall region, not to the flow between two different shear layers. In the present CFD analysis of the temperature distributions such as the curve shape (Fig. 9(a) and (b)), the curve shape of the tem- perature distribution by the CFD analysis is almost similar to the velocity distribution results in the CFD analysis, whereas the tem- perature shapes determined by Tollmien’s theory are different from that of the velocity due to the effect of the square root (Table 1). It is concluded that a careful investigation is necessary to find the rea- son for this difference. The velocity and temperature distributions along the jet centerline in the CFD results are decayed slowly except for Case-6 when compared with the test results. This may also be caused by the reduced transfer of the momentum and energy due to the over-predicted circulation flow (Case-1–Case-5) in the radial direction which may give rise to a slow decay of the momentum and energy along the axial direction.  5.   Conclusions  When a condensing steam jet is discharged into a subcooled water pool to form a turbulent jet, the local characteristics of that turbulent jet, such as its local velocity and temperature distri- butions, affect the overall mixing behavior in that pool. In this study, a CFD analysis of turbulent jet behaviors in a condensing pool was undertaken to investigate the applicability of the exist- ing semi-analytical correlations to a condensing steam jet-induced turbulent jet and also to analyze the thermal-hydraulic behavior, such as a global circulation and local hot spot, in a condensation pool for advanced light water reactors, based on its comparison with experimental data. Since the measured range of the velocity and temperature distribution was limited mainly for some practi- cal reasons, a CFD analysis was used to generate the velocity and temperature data at the unmeasured regions. As for the first step toward the prediction of the overall flow circulation behavior in a condensing pool, the validation work using a commercial code, CFX-11, including a sensitivity analysis was performed against the test results. The results of the CFD sensitivity analysis show that the value of the turbulent intensity at the inlet region is the most important fac- tor because it determines the jet boundary through a momentum diffusion process in the radial direction. The difference in the CFD analysis results due to a variation of the mesh distribution, and the selected convection term methods and the turbulent models was found to be negligible because the flow structure at the region of interest was very simple. New efforts regarding an experiment and CFD analysis have been made recently for characterizing the overall circulation phe- nomena due to a steam discharge in a subcooled water pool at KAERI in order to characterize a higher value of the turbulent intensity in and around a turbulent jet in a quantitative way. And finally our next steps toward a complete analysis of steam jet- induced thermal mixing in a pool will be given to the analysis of a condensing steam jet by both CFD analysis and the sophisticated experiments focusing on local thermo-fluid behavior inside and near the boundary of a steam jet.
