ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT
Article history: A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for a turbulent jet flow induced by a steam jet discharged
Received 28 January 2009 into a subcooled water pool was performed for 10s of transients to investigate whether the currently
Received in revised form 25 June 2009 available CFD codes can be suitably used as a tool to investigate the applicability of the existing semi-
LCCERES RII analytical correlations to a condensing jet-induced turbulent jet and to analyze the thermal-hydraulic
behavior, such as global circulation and local hot spot, in a condensation pool for advanced light water
reactors. As for the numerical experiment, a series of sensitivity calculations was conducted system-
atically to elucidate the major factors which can cause different analysis results by varying the mesh
distributions, numerical models for a convection term and an eddy viscosity term. The effect of a differ-
ence in the velocity and the temperature distribution in a region between the sparger and the pool wall
has not been observed in the afore-mentioned sensitivity calculations. The comparison of the CFD results
with the test data shows that the CFD analysis does not accurately simulate the local phenomenon of a
turbulent jet existing downstream of a steam jet. It was found that the value of the turbulent intensity at
the inlet of the turbulent jet region is the most important factor because it can determine the boundary
of a turbulent jet through a momentum diffusion process in a radial direction. The comparison of the CFD
results with the test data shows that the CFD analysis can accurately simulate the local phenomenon of
a turbulent jet existing downstream of a steam jet only when the CFD analysis reflects the physics of a
turbulent jet.
