              Abstract: The ambient seismic wave ﬁeld, also known as ambient noise, is excited by oceanic
         gravity waves primarily. This can be categorized as seismic hum (1–20 mHz), primary microseisms
         (0.02–0.1 Hz), and secondary microseisms (0.1–1 Hz). Below 20 mHz, pressure ﬂuctuations of ocean
         infragravity waves reach the abyssal ﬂoor. Topographic coupling between seismic waves and ocean
         infragravity waves at the abyssal ﬂoor can explain the observed shear traction sources. Below
         5 mHz, atmospheric disturbances may also contribute to this excitation. Excitation of primary
         microseisms can be attributed to topographic coupling between ocean swell and seismic waves on
         subtle undulation of continental shelves. Excitation of secondary microseisms can be attributed to
         non-linear forcing by standing ocean swell at the sea surface in both pelagic and coastal regions.
         Recent developments in source location based on body-wave microseisms enable us to estimate
         forcing quantitatively. For a comprehensive understanding, we must consider the solid Earth, the
         ocean, and the atmosphere as a coupled system.

Fig. 10. (a) Schematic of the excitation mechanisms of seismic hum. The observed equivalent shear traction source at the seaﬂoor can be
     explained by the topographic coupling between ocean infragravity waves and the background Love and Rayleigh waves. This coupling
     occurs eﬃciently when the wavelength 6 of the infragravity waves at the corresponding frequency and the horizontal scale of the
     topography match each other. H(6) is the height of the hill with a horizontal scale of 6. This ﬁgure also shows a schematic of the

     the correlation length Lp excites background Rayleigh waves. (b) Schematic of excitation mechanisms of primary and secondary
     microseisms. The excitation of primary microseisms can be explained by the topographic coupling in a shallow coastal region. The
     excitation mechanism of secondary microseisms can be explained by nonlinear forcing at the surface of the ocean by ocean swell in
     both coastal and pelagic areas. When two regular wave trains traveling in opposite directions with displacement amplitudes at the sea
     surface interact, the second-order pressure ﬂuctuation /p at the sea surface with the correlation length Lp excites background Rayleigh
     waves.

      Proﬁle

           Kiwamu Nishida was born in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1973 and graduated from
      Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1996. He received M.S. from Tokyo Institute of
      Technology in 1996, and Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo in 2001. He stated his
      research career as a JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow at Earthquake Research Institute (ERI),
      the University of Tokyo. He then became an assistant professor at ERI in 2002. He was
      promoted to an Associate Professor in 2013. He is studying origins of ambient seismic and
      acoustic wave ﬁeld excited by ocean waves, and atmospheric disturbances. He is also
      developing a technique of seismic interferometry, which is a seismic exploration technique
      of the Earth’s interior from the ambient seismic wave ﬁeld.
           He was awarded the Young Scientist Award of Seismological Society of Japan in
      2003, the Japan Academy Medal from the Japan Academy and the JSPS Prize from the
      Japan Society for the Promotion of Science in 2016.
