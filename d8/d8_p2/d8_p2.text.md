Atmospheric resonances and their coupling
to vibrations of the ground and waves
in the ocean
Oleg A. Godin1* , Nikolay A. Zabotin2 and Liudmila Zabotina2


  Abstract
  Observations of the ionosphere with the airglow, GPS-TEC, and HF radar techniques reveal a resonant response of the
  middle and upper atmosphere to broad-band excitation by earthquakes, volcano eruptions, and convective storms.
  The resonances occur at such frequencies that an atmospheric wave, which is radiated at the ground level and is
  reflected from a turning point in the middle or upper atmosphere, upon return to the ground level satisfies bound-
  ary conditions on the ground. Using asymptotic and numerical models of atmospheric waves, this paper investigates
  atmospheric resonances and their excitation by seismic waves and infragravity waves in the ocean. It is found that
  “buoyancy” resonances with periods up to several hours arise in addition to “acoustic” resonances with periods of
  about 3–5 min. The acoustic and buoyancy resonances occur, respectively, on the acoustic and gravity branches of
  the dispersion curve of acoustic-gravity waves. Buoyancy of the atmosphere is important for the resonances of both
  kinds. Acoustic resonances are found to be sensitive to the temperature profile, especially around mesopause and
  tropopause, and are predicted to be a seasonal phenomenon in polar atmosphere. Unlike acoustic resonances, buoy-
  ancy resonances exhibit high sensitivity to the wind velocity profile and its variations. The resonances correspond to
  most efficient coupling between the atmosphere and its lower boundary and are promising for detection of such
  coupling.

wider bands with smaller peak amplitudes, which extend
to lower frequencies in Fig. 6. These bands represent
resonances with a low quality factor and are apparently
caused by the partial reflections in the atmosphere that
are not captured in the asymptotic theory. With these
caveats, comparison of Figs. 5a and 6 shows a qualitative
agreement between the asymptotic theory and numerical
results for the lowest order resonances and a very good
quantitative agreement for resonances of the order n > 3.
  The resonance order n, the number of buoyancy reso-
