Accepted 13 JUN 2018
Accepted article online 22 JUN 2018       In seismology, the term Green’s function refers to the elastic response of the Earth due to an impulse source
Published online 4 AUG 2018               (e.g., Wapenaar et al., 2008). Under suitable conditions (e.g., uniformly distributed sources and long-enough
                                          records), the Green’s function can be approximated by cross-correlating ambient seismic noise recorded at
                                          two seismometers (e.g., Curtis et al., 2006; Tsai, 2010; Wapenaar, 2004). In this case, one seismometer acts
                                          as a virtual source for the other receiver and vice versa. As ambient seismic noise consists mostly of disper-
                                          sive surface waves, cross-correlations of noise records contain information about the subsurface. This can be
                                          exploited to image the ground by surface-wave tomography or to monitor velocity changes based on the
                                          coda of cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise (for a review, see Campillo & Roux, 2015). It is possible
                                          to monitor the subsurface even if the Green’s function is not properly reconstructed as long as the
                                          cross-correlation functions are stable in time (Hadziioannou et al., 2009).
                                          Seismic interferometry has revolutionized seismology in ﬁelds such as crustal tomography and monitoring
                                          of volcanoes and ﬂuid ﬂows. Cryoseismology is only starting to exploit this new technique, likely due to the
                                          following potential pitfalls: First, relatively homogeneous glacier ice impedes scattering, which is necessary
                                          to overcome an uneven source distribution (Gouédard et al., 2008). Second, owing to the limited thickness of
                                          glaciers, high frequencies (>∼1 Hz) have to be studied, where glacial noise sources are changing on timescales
                                          of days or even hours. Finally, installing seismometers on glaciers is still challenging (Podolskiy & Walter,
                                          2016). Nevertheless, approximations of the Green’s function would allow us to study the structure of the ice
                                          and the underlying bedrock, which is labor-intensive using classical approaches (ice-penetrating radar, active
                                          seismics, and drilling).

                         the thickness of the glacier can be constrained with another method. We will show that this can be achieved
                         with the help of a second seismometer and several hours of seismic noise records.
                         In a cryospheric context, Mordret et al. (2016) used cross-correlation functions from on-rock long-period seis-
                         mometers in Greenland to monitor the mass changes caused by the seasonal melting of the ice sheet. As they
                         used low frequencies (0.1–0.3 Hz), the cross-correlation functions are not sensitive to the ice itself, but to the
                         shallow crust below the ice sheet in a depth range of (3–10 km). There, the mass change of the ice sheet
                         causes small changes in the seismic velocity due to poroelastic eﬀects. These small changes can be detected
                         using seismic interferometry, that is, by analyzing the changes of the cross-correlation functions over time.
                         Long-term installations directly on or in glacial ice have increased in recent years due to technological
                         improvements (Aster & Winberry, 2017). One example of seismic networks suitable for cross-correlation stud-
                         ies are those installed during three ﬁeld seasons on Amery ice shelf in Antarctica around a propagating ice
                         rift (Bassis et al., 2008). Zhan et al. (2014) calculated cross-correlation functions from this data set in two
                         frequency bands (1–5 and 5–10 Hz). For the higher frequencies, the cross-correlation functions converge
                         towards Green’s functions. However, due to the high frequencies, these are only sensitive to depths up to
                         about 100 m and hence signiﬁcantly less than the ice shelf thickness. In the lower frequency band, the authors
                         did not use the cross-correlation functions directly due to the large diﬀerences to synthetic Green’s functions.
                         These discrepancies are caused by the low-velocity water layer below the ﬂoating ice shelf, which causes a sig-
                         niﬁcantly nondiﬀuse noise ﬁeld, impeding convergence from cross-correlation to Green’s functions. Instead,
                         Zhan et al. (2014) used spectral ratios between diﬀerent components of the Green’s tensor to describe the
                         depth-dependent structure of Amery ice shelf.
                         MacAyeal et al. (2015) studied ambient noise cross-correlation from stations deployed on a tabular iceberg in
                         the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The cross-correlation functions they computed show clear asymmetry, indicating a
                         localized noise source, identiﬁed to originate from the collisions with a neighboring iceberg. Although they
                         could identify propagating wave phases, they noted that noise correlation functions do not converge towards
                         Green’s functions (MacAyeal et al., 2015).
                         Seismic interferometry on glaciers was also attempted by Walter (2009), who correlated 1-hr noise records
                         from Gornergletscher, Switzerland, which did not result in stable cross-correlation functions for diﬀerent
                         times. Podolskiy and Walter (2016) argue that the relative homogeneity of glacier ice inhibits scattering, which
                         is necessary to reconstruct Green’s functions from an uneven source distribution (Gouédard et al., 2008).
                         Consequently, rather than continuous noise, Walter et al. (2015) used icequake signals within the same data
                         set to recover approximate Green’s functions.
                         In most crustal studies, the frequency band of the microseisms or below (<0.2 Hz) is used, as noise sources
                         with frequencies above 1 Hz are commonly considered to be anthropogenic (Bonnefoy-Claudet et al., 2006).
                         Since we are interested in the shallower glacier and its bed, we use these higher frequencies (1 Hz and
                         above), where in a glaciological context also other sources such as icequakes, ﬂowing water, and wind are
                         active (Anthony et al., 2015; Bartholomaus et al., 2015; Deichmann et al., 1979). Whereas anthropogenic
                         sources can usually be distinguished by their temporal pattern (Diez et al., 2016), separation of the other
                         sources can prove more diﬃcult. Depending on the season, the seismometer location, and the glacier, these
                         sources contribute diﬀerently and change their power over time, which can help to determine the mechanism
                         responsible for generating the seismic noise. Additionally, locating the source regions can help to identify the
                         noise source processes.
                         In this paper, we ﬁrst examine under what conditions we can retrieve approximate Green’s functions from few
                         hours of noise recorded on a glacier network. We then calculate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the Green’s
                         functions to show that seismic interferometry performs better in summer than in winter. Using the amplitude
                         asymmetry of the cross-correlation functions as well as beamforming, we locate the sources and identify them
                         using spectrograms, water discharge data and glacier ﬂow speed measurements. We ﬁnally show how these
                         estimated Green’s functions can be useful to retrieve the glacier thickness.

                         2. Study Sites
                         The data we use in this paper are from two glacier seismic networks, which were installed in the ablation zone
                         of two temperate Alpine glaciers in Switzerland: Aletschgletscher and Glacier de la Plaine Morte (Figure 1).
                         All seismic stations consisted of Lennartz LE-3D sensors with a natural frequency of 1 Hz and Nanometrics

                         works are on the order of a few kilometers. The three northernmost Aletschgletscher stations were installed
                         for about 1.5 years, which makes this network the longest-running seismometer installation on temperate
                         ice (according to our knowledge). The network was reinforced by adding six stations for about 2 weeks.

                         were visually ﬁtted and correspond to a velocity of 1.65 km/s, which seems to match quite well with the arrival times
                         of a direct Rayleigh wave on Aletschgletscher.


                         to a certain degree. Noteworthy are some week-long outages at Aletschgletscher (caused by borehole seis-
                         mometers melting out of the ice in summer, snow covering the solar panels during winter, and possibly
                         lightning strikes).
                         Aletschgletscher, a Swiss valley glacier and the largest in the European Alps, moves at around 100 m/a and is
                         several hundred meters thick. Glacier de la Plaine Morte is a Swiss plateau glacier moving only about 2 m/a
                         and featuring very few crevasses, and it is slightly more than a hundred meters thick. The seismicity they
                         exhibit varies substantially (see typical 1-day seismograms [Figures 1e–1f ] and corresponding spectrograms
                         [Figures 1g–1h]). Clearly visible on both glaciers is glacial seismic noise between ∼2 and 100 Hz, broadband
                         icequakes, as well as microseismic noise below ∼0.2 Hz.


                         3. Methods and Data Processing
                         In order to retrieve the Green’s functions, we use MSNoise (Lecocq et al., 2014). This freely available
                         open-source software package provides a workﬂow to calculate cross-correlation functions from ambient
                         seismic noise. As it is written in Python, it can be easily adapted or extended to match one’s speciﬁc needs.
                         Although our networks were entirely comprised of three-components seismometers, we use the vertical com-
                         ponents only. After applying a broad band-pass ﬁlter (0.3–45 Hz) and downsampling to 100 Hz sampling rate,
                         we clipped all traces at three times RMS to reduce the eﬀects of teleseismic events (Sabra, Gerstoft, et al.,
                         2005). Next, the traces are whitened between a narrower frequency band (2–8 Hz) and cross-correlated in
                         nonoverlapping 30-min windows. Finally, the results are stacked to daily cross-correlation functions.
                         We experimented with diﬀerent processing parameters, and our ﬁndings presented here are not very sensitive
                         to the applied processing. We use the same band-pass ﬁlter (2–8 Hz) and parameters for the two glaciers,
                         which are mostly the default parameters of MSNoise. For more thorough reviews of processing schemes, we
                         refer to Bensen et al. (2007) and Groos et al. (2011).


                         4. Resulting Green’s Function Estimates
                         Plotting the cross-correlations (1-day stacks) from all pairs as a function of the interstation distance, we obtain
                         virtual seismic record sections (Figure 2). In the case of Aletschgletscher, and to a lesser extent on Glacier
                         de la Plaine Morte, we can identify a wave train that travels through the array at a group velocity of roughly
                         1.65 km/s. This agrees well with previous measurements of Rayleigh wave velocity in ice (Roux et al., 2010).
                         It should be pointed out that the noise levels of the ice-rock cross-correlation functions are higher than
                         correlation pairs with similar distances within the glacier. We will brieﬂy discuss this in section 5.2.

                                          5. Temporal Dependence of the Green’s Function Convergence
                                          5.1. Ice-Ice Cross-Correlation Functions
                                          Despite identical processing parameters, we can see large diﬀerences between the quality of the recon-
                                          structed virtual seismograms. To investigate the convergence of the cross-correlation function stacks to
                                          Green’s functions quantitatively, we calculate the SNR of the cross-correlation functions by dividing the abso-
                                          lute value of the peak of the direct arrival by the standard deviation of a noise window at later lag times
                                          (Sabra, Gerstoft, et al., 2005). The direct arrival time was determined from the interstation distance and a
                                          ﬁxed expected Rayleigh wave velocity (1,600 m/s), and the peak was searched within 0.2 s. This is done after
                                          summing the acausal and the causal part of the cross-correlation function to obtain a symmetric function
                                          and hence suppress directionality eﬀects (sometimes referred to as folding). These are caused by an uneven
                                          source distribution and lead to cross-correlation functions that are symmetric in arrival times but asymmet-
                                          ric in amplitudes. Regarded as a nuisance here, we will exploit this asymmetry in section 6.2.1. Although the
                                          early arrivals should not interfere with the SNR measurement, which takes into the account the direct arrivals
                                          only, folding also reduces the amplitude of these early arrivals, since they appear only on one side of the
                                          cross-correlation function (Figure 2b). We ﬁnally calculate the SNR for stacks of diﬀerent durations to quantify
                                          the convergence rate towards the Green’s functions.
                                          In Figure 3a, we use the cross-correlation functions between two stations at Aletschgletscher and plot
                                          monthly means of their SNR curves. As expected, the SNR curves are approximately proportional to the square
                                          root of the recording time (Sabra, Gerstoft, et al., 2005). An important ﬁnding is that stacking of about a dozen
                                          of cross-correlation functions (calculated from 30-min windows) is suﬃcient and the SNR does not substan-
                                          tially improve after ∼6 hr (Figure 3a). However, there is a strong seasonal diﬀerence: In the wintertime (brown
                                          colors), the maximum SNR is about 6 dB lower than during summer (magenta colors). Another way to illus-
                                          trate this point is the SNR that we obtain after 4 hr of stacking (Figure 3b). Although there are large gaps (as
                                          we can only use days where both stations were operational), the overall pattern of lower SNR in winter and
                                          higher SNR in summer is clearly visible. We can conﬁrm this seasonal pattern if we also plot the evolution of
                                          the SNR at Glacier de la Plaine Morte, where we have continuous data from May to early September.
                                          Comparing the SNR curve of Aletschgletscher to a spectrogram of one of the two stations (Figure 3d) shows
                                          that periods during which the frequency band of interest (2–8 Hz in this case) is noisier lead to higher SNRs.

                  Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface                                             10.1029/2017JF004498


                         Periods of elevated seismic energy likely correspond to periods of enhanced surface melt, that is, summer
                         (Dalban Canassy et al., 2016). As we discuss in section 7, this is likely not an eﬀect of source strength but
                         of a more homogeneous noise distribution. It is interesting to note that the seasonality is in contrast to the
                         seismic interferometry studies using microseismic noise: The microseismic sources observed in the northern
                         hemisphere are stronger during winter due to storms in the Atlantic (Custodio et al., 2014; McNamara &
                         Buland, 2004).
                         Due to the seasonal pattern in the convergence rates of the noise correlation functions, it is not straight
                         forward to compare between the glaciers in a meaningful way, as not all the diﬀerent networks were oper-
                         ational at the exact same time. Additionally, the SNR of cross-correlation function decreases for increasing
                         interstation distance and higher frequencies due to seismic attenuation. Therefore, we use the SNR curves
                         for two station pairs on Aletschgletscher and Glacier de la Plaine Morte with comparable interstation dis-
                         tance (349 m for AG01:AG02 and 359 m for PM02:PM04), which were operational on the exact same dates.
                         We perform the comparisons in the same frequency band (2–8 Hz). Due to the close proximity of all the sta-
                         tions to each other (<50 km interstation distance), and the fact that they were all in the same geographic
                         region of Switzerland, we can also reasonably assume that they were subject to similar meteorological con-
                         ditions. The Aletschgletscher and Glacier de la Plaine Morte stations were installed in shallow ice boreholes;
                         therefore, the coupling for these stations is comparable.
                         Comparing Aletschgletscher to Glacier de la Plaine Morte (dark and light red lines in Figure 3c), we can see
                         that the SNR is signiﬁcantly higher on Aletschgletscher. Therefore, the SNR appears to be inversely related to
                         the elevation of the glacier. There are two possible explanations: Either this is due to generally lower noise
                         levels at higher elevations, which would fall back onto a relation of the seismic noise with liquid water,
                         as greater elevation means colder and hence less melt, or the structural diﬀerences between the diﬀer-
                         ent glaciers play a role, with the relation to elevation being a mere coincidence. The seasonality of the
                         SNR points to the former hypothesis. In section 7, we will address this in more detail. Finally, we cannot
                         exclude a dependence of the convergence towards Green’s functions on interstation azimuths. Estimates from
                         the cross-shaped and equally spaced network at Glacier de la Plaine Morte suggest a negligible azimuthal
                         dependence (not shown).
                         As the SNR stabilizes after several hours of stacking, we can also investigate temporal changes of the glacier’s
                         properties that result in changes to the Green’s functions, at a resolution as low as a few hours. To avoid diurnal
                         variations and for convenience we use 1-day stacks, which are readily produced by MSNoise (Lecocq et al.,
                         2014), for the rest of the paper.

                         5.2. Ice-Rock Cross-Correlation Functions
                         The two arrays in Switzerland had a reference seismometer installed on rock in close vicinity to the glacier
                         network (<4 km, Figure 1). These allow us to compute cross-correlations between the stations installed in the
                         ice and the stations installed on solid rock. Due the larger distances, we go to lower frequencies to reduce
                         attenuation (0.2–4 Hz instead of 2–8 Hz). For some station pairs, these cross-correlation functions also show
                         a direct arrival, however less pronounced (Figure S1 in the supporting information). As the rock stations are
                         outside the main glacier noise source areas, it is more diﬃcult to fulﬁll the homogeneous sources distribution
                         criterion, which leads to a poorer reconstruction of the Green’s functions. In addition, due to the likely com-
                         plicated seismic coupling between rock and ice, which we expect to aﬀect convergence to Green’s functions,
                         we refrain from further analyzing these.


                         6. Applications
                         6.1. Dispersion Curves and Glacier Thickness
                         An important application of ambient noise Green’s function recovery is surface wave tomography. As a step
                         towards this goal we show that we can measure the thickness of Aletschgletscher by extracting dispersion
                         curves from the cross-correlation functions using “Aki’s spectral method” (ASM), as described by Ekström et al.
                         (2009) and Ekström (2014) based on Aki (1957). ASM exploits the fact that the real part of the spectrum of
                         the cross-correlation function between the two stations can be matched to a Bessel function. ASM is closely
                         related to the spatial autocorrelation, and we refer to Tsai and Moschetti (2010) for a detailed comparison.
                         It should be noted that ASM theoretically assumes a suﬃciently isotropic noise ﬁeld, practically this assump-
                         tion can be relaxed by using a normalization such as whitening (Ekström et al., 2009).

                         Figure 4. (a) The real part of the spectrum of the cross-correlation function of a pair of two shallow ice borehole
                         seismometers 1.2 km apart, with the zero-crossings marked by triangles. (b) Dispersion curves obtained with “Aki’s
                         spectral method” (Ekström, 2014; Ekström et al., 2009) from the zero-crossings of the upper panel along with synthetic
                         dispersion curves for an ice body over a bedrock half-space.


                         Commonly, dispersion curves are constructed with frequency-time analysis, beamforming, or spatial auto-
                         correlation. The latter two both require several stations in a speciﬁc geometry (i.e., a seismic array; Wathelet
                         et al., 2007), whereas we only use a pair of stations. Another advantage of ASM concerns the station separa-
                         tion, where contrary to beamforming and frequency-time analysis there are no theoretical or practical limits
                         (Bensen et al., 2007; Ekström et al., 2009).
                         We use ASM (Ekström, 2014; Ekström et al., 2009) on a pair of two borehole seismometers on Aletschgletscher
                         1.2 km apart to obtain dispersion curves and hence measure the ice thickness. We take the cross-correlation
                         function calculated with a wider band-pass ﬁlter (0.08–48 Hz) but otherwise unchanged processing
                         parameters. The zero-crossings through the frequency axis of the real part of the smoothed spectrum of
                         the cross-correlation function are segregated into upgoing (red triangles in Figure 4a) and downgoing
                         (blue triangles). We then match the zero-crossings against the zeros of the Bessel function to obtain dispersion
                         curves. As there is the possibility of having missed one or several zero-crossings, several dispersion curves are
                         generated (dashed lines in Figure 4b). The correct ones are identiﬁed by judging the plausibility of the results,
                         that is, if the phase velocities are reasonable for a given frequency and if the dispersion curves are smooth
                         and continuous (Ekström et al., 2009).
                         To assess the plausibility of our results, we compute three theoretical dispersion curves with a 400m, 500m
                         and 600m thick layer of ice (P∼wave velocity 3,400 m/s, S wave velocity 1,700 m/s, density 917 kg/m3 ) over a
                         homogeneous half-space representing the bedrock (P wave velocity 5,000 m/s, S wave velocity 2,550 m/s, and
                         density 2,750 kg/m3 ) using Geopsy’s dispersion curve tool (gpdc, Wathelet et al., 2005, results shown as black
                         lines in Figure 4). They visually match the dispersion curves estimated from the cross-correlation functions,
                         which shows that the Aletschgletscher can be estimated to around 500 m thickness at the location of our
                         array. This is in agreement with previously reported thicknesses (Farinotti et al., 2009; Jouvet et al., 2011) and
                         conﬁrms that our cross-correlation functions contain information that could be exploited for tomographic
                         applications. The bedrock parameters used here are the same as in Walter et al. (2010) but cannot be resolved
                         from our dispersion curves, as the spectra of the cross-correlation function lack zero-crossings below 1 Hz,

                         that is, at frequencies that are sensitive to the bedrock (Figure 4a). To increase the number of zero-crossings
                         and hence the number of data points for the dispersion curve, the stations would need to be spaced
                         further apart.

                         6.2. Noise Source Characterization
                         6.2.1. Noise Source Location
                         Methods to locate the sources that contribute to the recovery of the Green’s function exploit the fact that the
                         cross-correlation function is asymmetric in amplitudes if the sources are not uniformly distributed (Ermert
                         et al., 2015; Sadeghisorkhani et al., 2016; Stehly et al., 2006; Tian & Ritzwoller, 2015; Yang & Ritzwoller, 2008).
                         Here we use the energy ﬂux across to array to ﬁnd the azimuth towards the possible source region. If the
                         sources are denser and/or stronger on one side of the cross-correlation pair than on the other, the energy
                         ﬂux is not the same in both directions. This will lead to a net energy ﬂux across the array. Therefore, the
                         resulting cross correlation functions will be asymmetric in amplitude, but not in phase, since the latter is
                         determined by the velocity of the medium. Having a network of stations and cross-correlation pairs, the orien-
                         tation of the energy ﬂux can be measured and will point away from the dominant sources (Stehly et al., 2006).
                         Due to a limited number of stations compared to these studies cited, which use regional or global networks
                         with dozens of stations, we limit ourselves to a more qualitative estimate of the azimuth towards possible
                         source regions.
                         We implement the measurement of the energy ﬂux by taking the maximum of the envelope (square-root of
                         the sum of the squared amplitudes of the function and its Hilbert transform) in a window around the expected
                         arrival time of the direct wave on either side of the cross-correlation function. If we take the cross-correlation

                                         function between station A and B CCF(A,B), the logarithmic ratio
                                                                                          max(envelope(CCF(A, B)causal )))

                                                                                          max(envelope(CCF(A, B)acausal ))

                                         is positive if the arrival on the causal side is larger than on the acausal side, and negative in the opposite
                                         case. This means that the direct waves between those two stations travel primarily from A to B. Therefore, the
                                         sources behind A are stronger than behind B. Similarly, the ratio is negative if seismic energy ﬂows from B to
                                         A. If the sources are equally strong, the peaks on both side will have approximately the same amplitude and
                                         the resulting ratio will be close to zero.
                                         By calculating this ratio for all station pairs within the network and therefore with a large range of azimuths, we
                                         can identify the dominating source regions. This works well for the Aletschgletscher (Figure 5), where we have
                                         a relatively dense network and cross-correlation functions with clear direct arrivals. Figures 5a to 5c show the
                                         direction of energy ﬂow on three selected days (22 May, 25 May, and 2 June 2016). The start and end points of
                                         the rays connecting each station pair are colored according to the direction of the energy ﬂux, greenish colors
                                         show a ﬂux towards a station, while reddish colors show a ﬂux away from a station. This means that green bars
                                         point from a station towards the source region, while red bars point away from the source regions. Figure 5a
                                         shows that on 22 May, the seismic energy ﬂux is coming mainly from the south. Three days later, the dominant
                                         sources are in the north (Figure 5b). Another week later, the sources are in the south again (Figure 5c).
                                         We also locate the sources in the frequency band 2–8 Hz with beamforming, which yields the backazimuth
                                         from the seismic array to the source as well as a propagation velocity (Figure 5). We closely follow Walter et al.
                                         (2015) and match a synthetic ﬁeld with all possible backazimuths and velocities against the cross-spectral

                         K is the ensemble average of the outer product of the n-dimensional vector d, containing the discrete
                         Fourier transform at frequency 𝜔 for n stations, and its complex conjugate. We match the estimate using the
                         Bartlett processor, which will be maximum when the candidate backazimuth equals the true backazimuth.
                         The cross-spectral density matrix can also be decomposed into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The strongest
                         eigenvalue, which is commonly associated with the dominant noise source, can be removed and therefore
                         weaker noise sources can be found (Walter et al., 2015).
                         Here we use ensemble averages over 45 windows of 20 s length, which leads to a higher temporal resolution
                         than the location procedure with cross-correlation functions described before. From the backazimuth we can
                         see that the possible dominant source origins (black dots in Figure 5d) agree well with the rather qualitative
                         estimates using the cross-correlation functions (a to c). Additionally, the mean seismic velocity obtained from
                         beamforming (1.67 km/s) is close to our estimate as shown in Figure 2 (1.65 km/s).
                         The secondary source obtained after singular value decomposition populates the gaps (gray squares in panel
                         d), which shows that the sources in the north of the array (backazimuth around 0∘ or 360∘ ) and in the south
                         (backazimuth around 180∘ ) are concurrent and active at the same time.
                         6.2.2. Seismic Source Activity
                         The results of section 6.2.1 show that our noise sources on Aletschgletscher change over time. In order to
                         identify the noise sources, we will focus on the analysis of two time windows, one in the beginning of the
                         melt season in spring, the other one at the end of the melt season in fall, to identify possible noise sources
                         (Figure S2 shows this data set over the full duration of our experiment).
                         We use the methodology of Bartholomaus et al. (2015) to calculate the tremor amplitude of our long-term
                         seismic stations on Aletschgletscher. We take the median power spectral densities within 10-min windows
                         consisting of short-duration 20-s windows with 50% overlap. The resulting “median spectrograms” are shown
                         in Figures 6a and 6d. We then integrate over the frequency range 2–8 Hz to obtain the tremor amplitude with
                         the unit of velocity (red curves in Figures 6b and 6e). The blue curves in the same panels are discharge data
                         measured at a stream gauge a few kilometers downstream. We also show high-resolution GPS measurements
                         from units colocated with some of the seismometers to monitor the speed of glacier ﬂow (Figures 6c and 6f ).
                         From Figure 6, we can recognize at least three possible source mechanisms:
                         1. An anthropogenic source—An inspection of the ﬁrst 3 weeks of the median spectrogram (Figure 6a) reveals
                            that the seismic noise in the frequency band of interest shows a weekday-weekend as well as a working
                            hour pattern (increased noise on weekdays between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. [local time], excluding lunch break
                            between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. [local time]), which is clear evidence of a man-made source. Additionally,
                            some monochromatic energy is present in the spectrogram (mostly below 2 Hz, but also around 5 Hz).
                         2. Seismic noise generated by ﬂowing water—In Figure 6e, daily peaks in discharge are preceded by a daily
                            peak in glaciohydraulic tremor amplitude with a lag of roughly 2–3 hr, which would be needed for the water
                            to ﬂow from the seismic stations to the gauge. During this time, a weekday-weekend pattern is not visible
                            in the spectrogram.
                         3. A source related to glacial movement—The horizontal GPS velocities (Figures 6c and 6f ) are elevated for
                            three periods, coinciding with higher seismic tremor amplitudes.
                         Icequakes occur on both glaciers we study here, but they are much more dominant at Aletschgletscher,
                         which produces several hundreds of distinguishable icequakes every day (Figure 1). They occur not nearly as
                         frequently on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, which barely ﬂows and has few crevasses exceeding 10 cm in width.
                         There are several possible origins of the anthropogenic source or sources (process #1), the Valais main
                         valley with heavy industrial activity roughly 25 km southwest of the array is a likely candidate. Water ﬂowing
                         in, above, or under a temperate valley glacier is an obvious source of seismic noise (process #2) and has been
                         observed on many other glaciers. A relationship between seismic power and discharge has been identiﬁed by
                         Bartholomaus et al. (2015) and subsequently, its generating mechanism was studied theoretically by Gimbert
                         et al. (2016). The third seismic noise source related to glacial movement (process #3) is probably the sustained
                         seismicity burst consisting of innumerable and indistinguishable icequakes. Higher glacier ﬂow leads to more
                         deformation and hence increased stress, which is released in icequakes. The abundant surface crevasses in
                         the vicinity of the stations on Aletschgletscher are most likely the source of many of these events, as our seis-
                         mometers are much more sensitive to surface icequakes rather than basal icequakes related to glacial sliding.

                                         Another changing source pattern was observed on Glacier de la Plaine Morte. A glacier-dammed lake is
                                         annually ﬁlled with meltwater and usually drains in late summer (Huss et al., 2013). Figure 7 shows the
                                         cross-correlation functions from two seismic stations over the period of a few weeks. While the lake is being
                                         ﬁlled, the phases of the cross-correlation functions are relatively stable. Nevertheless, there is a prominent
                                         increase in the amplitude of the direct wave on the causal side, that is, an increasing amount of energy is com-
                                         ing from the central part of the glacier. With the onset of the lake drainage, a dominant new source, likely a
                                         moulin into which the lake drains, becomes active and therefore the cross-correlation functions obtained are
                                         remarkably diﬀerent. This highlights the inﬂuence of the noise sources on the recovery of the Green’s function.


                                         7. Discussion: Green’s Function Retrieval
                                         Under favorable conditions, Green’s functions from on-ice networks can be estimated after cross-correlating
                                         several hours of seismic glacier noise. Here we will discuss what these conditions are and why the diﬀerences
                                         between the glaciers are so signiﬁcant.

                                         7.1. Eﬀects of Localized Sources
                                         In a relatively homogeneous medium such as ice and consequently only insigniﬁcant scattering, only sources
                                         in the end-ﬁre lobes of station pairs contribute to the convergence from cross-correlation function to the
                                         Green’s function (Campillo & Roux, 2015), that is, when the acoustic ray paths of the sources pass through one
                                         station to reach the other one. When there are moulins (vertical shafts where surface water can ﬂow into the
                                         glacier) or other strong seismic sources within the array, they are outside the end-ﬁre lobes for most station
                                         pairs and will appear in the cross-correlation function as early arrivals that are apparently faster than the direct
                                         waves between stations.
                                         Walter (2009), who correlated continuous records from Gornergletscher, Switzerland, did not succeed in pro-
                                         ducing stable correlation functions: Early arrivals, caused by moulins of varying activity within their network,
                                         dominated over the actual direct Rayleigh waves. This, combined with the likely too short stacking time (1 hr),
                                         is probably the reason why the cross-correlations of Walter (2009) were not stable.

                         Zhan et al. (2014), who used data from Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica, also had dominant sources in unfavor-
                         able positions: In addition to the seismic energy originating from the water below the ice shelf, at certain
                         times seismicity was focussed near the tip of a propagating ice rift, around which the network was arranged
                         (Heeszel et al., 2014). These two sources were not in the end-ﬁre lobes of the station pairs and hence did not
                         contribute to the convergence of the cross-correlation functions to Green’s functions. This might explain why
                         the cross-correlation functions where signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from synthetic Green’s functions in the 1- to 5-Hz
                         frequency band (Zhan et al., 2014).
                         In the cross-correlation gathers from Glacier de la Plaine Morte, there are still some early arrivals
                         (Figure 2b), whereas at Aletschgletscher, these are almost inexistent. This means that the seismic energy on
                         Aletschgletscher mostly originates in the end-ﬁre lobes of our station pairs, or over a wider azimuthal range
                         for which the nonstationary phases destructively interfere. At Glacier de la Plaine Morte, there is an additional
                         contribution from outside the end-ﬁre lobes as well, which does not cancel out, leading to early arrivals.
                         As moulins are dominant noise sources during high-melt periods, several authors have studied them and
                         developed methods to locate them (Aso et al., 2017; Röösli et al., 2014, 2016; Walter et al., 2015). Using
                         their techniques, it might be possible to develop an advanced processing scheme to retrieve Green’s
                         functions using noise cross-correlation also in these cases. For example, the spurious early arrivals in the
                         cross-correlation functions could be muted if the locations of the moulins within the array are known.
                         Another option would be to correlate only time windows when the tremor is absent, as the moulin activity is
                         intermittent.
                         7.2. Seasonal and Local Inﬂuences
                         In section 5, we calculated the SNR for the two glaciers. Aletschgletscher shows higher SNR than Glacier de
                         la Plaine Morte, and in summer, the SNR is generally higher than in winter. Enhanced surface melt in summer
                         is the likely cause for the increase in seismic energy (Figure 3d). We consider two competing eﬀects how this
                         melt-generated noise may aﬀect Green’s function convergence. First, widespread surface melt can homoge-
                         nize noise sources on the glacier, which leads to a better medium illumination and thus faster Green’s function
                         convergence. On the other hand, if the two stations of a cross-correlation pair receive increased energy from
                         already homogeneously spread noise sources, the variance of the cross-correlation function increases, lead-
                         ing to a decrease in Green’s function convergence (Sabra, Roux, & Kuperman, et al., 2005). Apparently, in our
                         case the former mechanism is dominant, and surface melt seismicity promotes a more homogeneous noise
                         distribution compared to winter months when surface melt is absent. Another, probably smaller eﬀect comes
                         from the snow layer that covers Alpine glaciers in winter. The attenuation of seismic waves in the frequencies
                         studied (2–8 Hz) is higher in snow than in ﬁrn or bare ice due to higher porosity (Peters et al., 2012). Thus,
                         less seismic noise will arrive coherently throughout the network, which will lead to a worse Green’s function
                         reconstruction in winter, when the glacier is covered in several meters of snow, than in summer.
                         As noted before, the SNR also appears to be inversely related to the elevation of the glacier. Given the small
                         sample number (n = 2), this relationship remains hypothetical. Nevertheless, it is consistent with our conclu-
                         sion of melt being generally higher at lower elevations and therefore better distributed seismic noise at lower
                         elevations. The substantially lower noise level and therefore likely unfavorable source distribution at Glacier
                         de la Plaine Morte (Figure 1) could be the reason of the lower SNR compared to Aletschgletscher.
                         We have also tried to apply the same methodology to a data set recorded on Bisgletscher, a heavily crevassed
                         avalanching glacier in Switzerland, which frequently loses large chunks of ice from its unstable tongue
                         (Raymond et al., 2003). There, the numerous and deep crevasses eﬀectively impede surface wave propaga-
                         tion, so that transient events such as icequakes look markedly diﬀerent compared to the other glaciers. Green’s
                         function retrieval in this case would probably beneﬁt from special processing, which is beyond the scope of
                         this paper.

                         8. Conclusions
                         Cross-correlating and stacking several hours of ambient glacier noise allows to reconstruct approximate
                         Green’s function under favorable conditions, notably if the noise sources are homogeneously distributed and
                         suitably stable. The SNR of the cross-correlation functions of the glaciers studied here is generally higher in
                         summer than in winter but converges to a stable values in both seasons. The diﬀerence arises from increased
                         surface melt in summer, which leads to turbulent water ﬂow, which generates seismic noise and promotes

                                              disturb the convergence to Green’s functions. Additionally, when intending to use Aki’s spectral method, it
                                              should be kept in mind that the larger the interstation distance, the more zero-crossings and the better sam-
                                              pled the dispersion curve will be. The absence of discrete point sources also increases the chance that the
                                              noise sources are evenly distributed, which is ideally the case in order to use Aki’s spectral method.
                                              8.1. Outlook
                                              The retrieval of Green’s functions also opens the door to imaging such as ambient noise surface-wave tomog-
                                              raphy, which has proven to be a powerful imaging tool in various solid-earth settings and could provide
                                              useful contributions in glaciology as well, for example, in the long-standing debate about the abundance
                                              of subglacial till or hard beds. Picotti et al. (2017) for example explain that the horizontal-to-vertical (H/V)
                                              spectral ratio technique allows to distinguish between a rigid bedrock or a deformable basement (or water)
                                              below the ice when the ice thickness can be determined using other methods. This would potentially mean
                                              that using two seismometers, simultaneously measuring ambient noise for several hours on a glacier could
                                              reveal both the ice thickness (using Aki’s spectral method described here) and the bed conditions (using H/V
                                              spectral ratios). This would be a less laborious solution compared to measurements involving active seismics,
                                              ice-penetrating radar and/or drilling.
                                              As maintaining long-term networks on high-melt glaciers is laborious (Pomeroy et al., 2013), experiments
                                              with a high number of instruments deployed for a relatively short time could prove useful on glaciers
                                              (Brenguier et al., 2016; Hand, 2014). With a favorable noise source distribution and a well designed network,
                                              such experiments need to be operational only for a few hours in order to image a glacier.
                                              Repeated retrieval of the cross-correlation function can be used to monitor the temporal variation of seis-
                                              mic velocity. Under the condition that the cross-correlation functions (or temporally averaged stacks thereof )
                                              are stable, their coda can be directly compared to each other and a possible change in seismic velocity can
                                              be detected by a shift in arrival times of the same phases between diﬀerent dates. This velocity change
                                              (dv/v) has been estimated in various settings and allows the monitoring of environmental parameters (Larose
