                                        SUMMARY
                                        We present a new seismic shear wave velocity model of the upper mantle of the Antarctic
                                        Plate region, AP2024. It includes the lithosphere and underlying mantle down to 660 km
                                        depth beneath both the continental and oceanic portions of the plate. To augment the limited
                                        seismic station coverage of Antarctica, we assemble very large regional and global data
                                        sets, comprising all publicly available broad-band seismic data. The model is built using
                                        785 thousand seismograms from over 27 thousand events and 8.7 thousand stations. It is
                                        constrained by both body and Rayleigh surface waves, ensuring the dense data sampling of
                                        the entire upper mantle depth range. The tomographic inversion is global but focused on the
                                        Antarctic Plate, with the data sampling maximized in the Southern Hemisphere, with elaborate
                                        automated and manual outlier analysis and removal performed on the regional data, and with
                                        the regularization tuned for the region. The upper mantle of the Antarctic continent exhibits
                                        a bimodal nature. The sharp boundary along the trans-Antarctic mountains separates the
                                        cratonic eastern from tectonic western Antarctica and shows a shear-velocity contrast of up to
                                        17 per cent at ∼100 km depth. The bimodal pattern is also seen in the oceanic part of the plate,
                                        with the older oceanic lithosphere beneath the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean showing
                                        higher shear velocities. The continental lithosphere in East Antarctica shows high velocity
                                        anomalies similar to those beneath stable cratons elsewhere around the world. It is laterally
                                        heterogeneous and exhibits significant thinning in the near-coastal parts of Dronning Maud
                                        Land and Wilkes Land. A low velocity channel is observed along the southern front of the
                                        West Antarctic Rift System and is probably related to Cenozoic rifting. High seismic velocity
                                        anomalies are detected beneath the Antarctic Peninsula and are likely to indicate fragments of
                                        the recently subducted Phoenix Plate Slab. Low velocity anomalies beneath Marie Byrd Land
                                        extend into the deep upper mantle and are consistent with a deep mantle upwelling feeding
                                        West Antarctica intraplate magmatism.

    Abstract: The deployment of seismic stations and the development of ambient noise tomography as well as new analysis methods provide an
    opportunity for higher-resolution imaging of Antarctica. Here we review recent seismic structure models and describe their implications for the
    dynamics and history of the Antarctic upper mantle. Results show that most of East Antarctica is underlain by continental lithosphere to depths
    of approximately 200 km. The thickest lithosphere is found in a band 500–1000 km inboard from the Transantarctic Mountains, representing
    the continuation of cratonic lithosphere with Australian afﬁnity beneath the ice. Dronning Maud Land and the Lambert Graben show much
    thinner lithosphere, consistent with Phanerozoic lithospheric disruption. The Transantarctic Mountains mark a sharp boundary between cra-
    tonic lithosphere and the warmer upper mantle of West Antarctica. In the southern Transantarctic Mountains, cratonic lithosphere has been
    replaced by warm asthenosphere, giving rise to Cenozoic volcanism and an elevated mountainous region. The Marie Byrd Land volcanic
    dome is underlain by slow seismic velocities extending through the transition zone, consistent with a mantle plume. Slow-velocity anomalies
    beneath the coast from the Amundsen Sea Embayment to the Antarctic Peninsula are likely to result from upwelling of warm asthenosphere
    during subduction of the Antarctic–Phoenix spreading centre.




    Seismological imaging provides essential constraints on the                        source seismic studies provide important details in some
    physical processes and conditions shaping the upper mantle                         speciﬁc regions.
    beneath Antarctica. Unlike other continents, the Antarctic
    mantle is overlain not only by the crust and sedimentary
    cover, but also by a thick ice sheet, which greatly limits geo-
    logical mapping and sampling. Thus, seismological studies                          Seismic data and analysis methods
    applied to Antarctica fulﬁll a unique role by providing
    information on poorly constrained geological processes that                        Antarctic seismic data
    have formed the continent. The ice sheets also constitute
    large, temporally varying loads that cause deformation of                          From the 1950s through to the 1990s, seismographs were

    discontinuity but anomalies beneath this are low amplitude
    and indistinct (Lloyd et al. 2020). P-wave travel-time tomog-
    raphy also shows prominent upper-mantle slow-velocity
    anomalies but the anomalies diverge laterally in the transition
    zone (Hansen et al. 2014; White-Gaynor et al. 2019). This
    does not necessarily eliminate the plume model, since geody-
    namical modelling suggests that plumes may be highly tilted
    in the mid-mantle (Bredow and Steinberger 2021). Emry
    et al. (2020), using receiver functions, found that the mantle
    transition zone was anomalously thin near Mount Erebus
    and along the adjacent TAMS, suggesting a warm thermal
    anomaly in the transition zone. French and Romanowicz
    (2015), in a global tomographic study, showed little anomaly
    in the transition zone, a signiﬁcant slow anomaly at depths of
    800–1200 km and no anomalies in the lower mantle (Phillips
    et al. 2018). Thus, it is clear that the region is underlain by a
    signiﬁcant thermal anomaly in the upper mantle but the exis-
    tence of a classic mantle plume arising near the core–mantle
    boundary remains uncertain.

                                        g., Aster & Winberry, 2017; Podolskiy & Walter, 2016). However, challenges persist in accurately characterizing
                                        firn properties (Maupin, 2017; Tanimoto et al., 2013). For instance, Zhang et al. (2022) constructed a shear‐wave
                                        velocity (VS) model in the upper 300 m through ambient noise tomography using data from a seismic array close
                                        to the WAIS Divide camp (Figure 1a), acquired as part of the Thwaites Interdisciplinary Margin Evolution
                                        (TIME) project (hereafter termed the “TIME array”). However, the model of Zhang et al. (2022) offers little
                                        constraint of the uppermost firn layer given limited data quality and sensitivity to shallow structures, and the
                                        predicted Rayleigh wave phase velocities (Vph) consistently exceed observations at frequencies >25 Hz. This also
                                        reduces the value of the method for further modeling studies.

                                        To improve the resolution of the uppermost firn (the so‐called firn‐air layer), we now use the Rayleigh wave H/V
                                        ratio, defined as the ratio of horizontal and vertical amplitude of the elliptical particle motion. This method has
                                        much higher sensitivity to shallow structures than Vph alone (e.g., Berbellini et al., 2019; Jones, Kulessa,
                                        et al., 2023; Jones, Ferreira, et al., 2023). We therefore undertake a joint inversion of Vph and H/V ratios of
                                        Rayleigh waves, extracted from ambient noise cross‐correlation (ANC), to enhance the resolution of VS in the
                                        uppermost 20 m. Additionally, we employ advanced denoising techniques (Herrin & Goforth, 1977; Qiu
                                        et al., 2021) on ANCs before measuring Rayleigh wave Vph and H/V ratios to mitigate measurement errors, which
                                        fortifies the reliability of subsequent inversion results.


                                        2. Data and Method
                                        2.1. Data
                                        The TIME array operated during Jan 5–16th, 2019, and consisted of two parts: 24 seismic nodes arranged at 15°
                                        intervals in a circle of radius of 500 m, and 76 nodes installed at 30 m intervals along a 1‐D linear array of ∼2.2 km
                                        length (Figure 1a). At each station, a Magseis Fairfield 5‐Hz 3‐component seismic node is installed (Ringler
                                        et al., 2018), programmed with 1,000 Hz sampling rate, pre‐amp gain of 12 dB, linear‐phase Nyquist filter, and
                                        DC offset removal. In this study, only the 1‐D linear array is analyzed.

                                        We calculate ANCs between 0.5 and 40 Hz and follow the methodology of Berg et al. (2018) to preserve relative
                                        amplitude between components (Text S1 in Supporting Information S1). In Figure 1b, surface waves traveling at
                                        ∼2 km/s are observed with larger amplitudes at negative time lag (i.e., acausal part), while high‐frequency surface
                                        waves appear only in the positive time lag between stations less than 1.5 km apart. This asymmetry of surface
                                        wave amplitudes has been widely observed in previous studies (Shapiro et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2019), likely due
                                        to the uneven distribution of noise sources (Chaput, Aster, Karplus, & Nakata, 2022, Chaput, Aster, Karplus,
                                        Nakata, et al., 2022). Given the complexity of signals with low signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) in the positive time lag
                                        of ANCs, we use the acausal part for a more robust analysis.
                                        The ANCs show multiple phases traveling at different speeds (labels 1–3 in Figures 1c and 1d). Phase 1 is the
                                        most prominent signal in the 3–30 Hz range and represents the fundamental‐mode Rayleigh wave with an
                                        array‐mean Vph dispersion consistent with that of Zhang et al. (2022). The two other phases are less

                                        Vph ≈3.8 km/s). Phase 3 is absent from the TT component. Polarization analysis (Text S1 in Supporting
                                        Information S1) suggests Phase 2 may correspond to a higher mode Rayleigh wave, and Phase 3 is likely a P

                                        fundamental‐mode Rayleigh waves. Based on ray theory, for surface waves traveling between three stations i, k

             are removed (white area). Negative distance means stations are closer to the origin than 1220. (c). H/V ratio at station 1220,

             improves in the denoised wavefield (Figure 2a). The other two phases, visible in the raw ANCs (Figure 1c, RR‐
             component), can no longer be seen after denoising since this approach does not preserve amplitude information
             and only retain the dominant surface wave signal ‐ the fundamental‐mode Rayleigh wave (Qiu et al., 2021).
             Thereafter, we adopt an automatic frequency‐time analysis to measure dispersion curves for all station pairs and
             apply eikonal tomography (Lin et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2019) to derive phase velocity maps at frequencies between
             3 and 30 Hz. The resulting Vph model (Figure 3a), consistent with the findings of Zhang et al. (2022), lacks lateral
             heterogeneity and gradually decreases from 1.8 km/s to 1.2 km/s as frequency increases.
             For H/V ratios, we employ a different noise reduction strategy, which involves phase‐matched filtering (Herrin &
             Goforth, 1977) to improve measurement qualities. The strategy aligns fundamental‐mode Rayleigh waves at
             different frequencies to zero lag using the obtained phase dispersion measurements. Figure 2b shows the phase‐
             match‐filtered ANCs for station pairs associated with a specific virtual receiver at RR and RZ components,
             respectively. We taper the phase‐match‐filtered ANCs within the time range of 0 ± 0.1 s, as other signals are
             expected to deviate from zero lag (Herrin & Goforth, 1977). Given the localized sensitivity of H/V ratio to
             shallow structures right beneath the receiver (e.g., Maupin, 2017), H/V ratios measured from ANCs associated

             with the same receiver but different virtual sources (Figure 2c) appear mutually consistent. Thus, we measure H/V
             ratio from the waveform stacked over phase‐match‐filtered ANCs of all virtual sources for each target receiver
             (Figure 2c). The obtained H/V ratio is linearly interpolated onto a regular 2‐D frequency‐space grid. The station
             spacing (30 m) is used as the spatial grid size. Unlike the Vph model, the H/V ratio demonstrates a more pro-
             nounced lateral variation (Figure 3a).
             Finally, we employ the improved Neighborhood Algorithm (Wathelet, 2008) to jointly invert Vph and H/V ratios
             for piecewise 1‐D VS profile (Text S2.3 in Supporting Information S1). Figure 3a shows the optimal 2‐D VS
             model, comprising 1‐D VS profiles from all grids: this shows prominent vertical variations and subtle lateral
             heterogeneities.


             2.3. 1‐D P‐Wave Travel‐Time Inversion
             Considering the limited sensitivity of Vph and H/V ratio to the P‐wave velocity (VP), we validate the model
             inverted from Section 2.2 with an independent VP model from diving waves in active‐source shot experiments,
             acquired along the linear section of the TIME array (Text S3 in Supporting Information S1). First‐break travel‐
             time picks, as a function of offset (Tx) (Figure 3b), are supplied to a Herglotz‐Wiechert inversion (HWI). HWI
             places stringent constraints on the smoothness and continuity of Tx data and their derivatives (Aki &
             Richards, 1980). We follow, in part, a HWI workflow widely‐applied in cryospheric studies (e.g., Brisbourne
             et al., 2020; King & Jarvis, 2007) but deviate from the way that Tx picks are smoothed (specifically, using a
             Levenberg‐Marquardt damped least‐squares fit to match an analytic Tx form (“KB90”; Kirchner & Bent-
             ley, 1990)). Here, Tx is smoothed using a more generalized Monte Carlo (MC) approach of McKeague (2023), to
             optimally satisfy HWI criteria for Tx but preferentially avoiding KB90's prescribed form for Tx (and, conse-
             quently, for the final velocity‐depth model). The output curves from KB90 and MC fits are shown in Figure 3b.
             The MC analysis converged on a solution after 105 iterations, and improves the root‐mean‐square (RMS) fit to the
             observed travel‐time data by ∼25% compared to KB90 (Figure 3b). The 1‐D velocity model output from HWI is
             presented in Figure 4a.

             3. Results
             The 1‐D VS profile (Figure 4a), averaged over all grids, illustrates notable velocity variations within the top
             ∼10 m. VS increases from 0.04 km/s to 0.9 km/s in the uppermost ∼5 m, followed by a sharp velocity increase to
             ∼1.2 km/s at ∼8 m depth. Below this, VS gradually increases, reaching 1.8 km/s by ∼45 m depth and 2 km/s by
             ∼65 m. VS is virtually constant in the deepest section, corresponding to glacier ice. Compared to the results of
             Zhang et al. (2022) (Figure 4a), our Vs model reveals more intricate details of shallow firn structures within the
             uppermost ∼20 m. The enhanced resolution is attributed to the inclusion of H/V ratios in the tomography (Text
             S2.3 in Supporting Information S1), and the improved SNR of measurements achieved from advanced denoising
             techniques. Although the VP profile from the inversion (Figure 4a) has inherent uncertainties due to limited
             sensitivity of Vph and H/V ratio to VP, it still provides a reliable approximation of the subsurface structure beneath
             the TIME array. Figure 4a compares the average VP profile from surface wave inversion (orange solid line) with
             the VP profile derived from active‐source shot experiments (orange dashed lines). Both VP models are similar,
             implying a rapid increase from 0.5 km/s to 2.2 km/s in the top 8 m, a further increase to 3.1 km/s at ∼45 m depth,
             and reach 3.4 km/s at ∼60 m depth. This consistency suggests that the inversion has converged to a desirable
             status, affirming the reliability of the obtained imaging results.

             The density of the firn column can be evaluated from VS using the empirical relationship of Diez et al. (2014).

             decreases to 45% within the top ∼8 m, corresponding to the initial stage of firn densification when ρ ≤ 506 kg/m3,
             mainly controlled by grain settling and packing. Further compression of air from the ice continues until reaching
             the pore close‐off depth ZPCOD, where no air connection to the surface remains and the density increases to pore
             close‐off density ρPCOD. ρPCOD is site dependent and usually between 800 and 830 kg/m3 (Cuffey & Pater-
             son, 2010). This process is often referred to as the second stage of firn densification (Herron & Langway, 1980),
             and multiple mechanisms may have contributed to the depletion of air content.

             Analysis of ice‐core samples at the study site suggests ρPCOD and ZPCOD are ∼823 kg/m3 and ∼57 m, respectively
             (Fegyveresi et al., 2011). Assuming ρPCOD = 823 kg/m3, we determine ZPCOD at ∼49 m using density profile in
             Figure 4a. Similarly, Diez et al. (2016) estimate ZPCOD at ∼47 m, and Zhang et al. (2022) at ∼62 m, with ρPCOD of
             830 kg/m3 based on VS imaging results from Rayleigh wave phase velocity. In comparison, model calculations at
             the study site suggest ZPCOD at ∼40–60 m (Battle et al., 2011; Kaspers et al., 2004). We note the pore close‐off
             process is not instantaneous, thus these estimations are overall consistent with each other, but we estimate the
             depths with better resolution.
             Density variation over depth due to change in air space can be expressed as (Herron & Langway, 1980)

             ferences never exceeding 20 years (inset in Figure 4a). These differences could result from the error of density‐

             but they nonetheless remain within the measurement uncertainty of ice core analysis (Sigl et al., 2016). This
             consistency further validates the reliability of our velocity models.


             4. Discussion
             Using only one week of passive seismic data recorded at surface nodes, our study improves the resolution within
             the firn layer, particularly in the upper ∼20 m, compared to previous seismic studies. The model compares well
             with the P‐wave velocity profile from active‐source shot experiments. Figure 4b presents a schematic illustration
             of the ice structure, highlighting the snow compaction process within the firn. This achievement is attributed to the
             joint inversion of high‐quality Vph and H/V ratio after applying advanced denoising procedures to ANCs.
             Furthermore, the Vs model can help capture and interpret critical aspects of firn dynamics with a robust empirical
             velocity‐density relation.

             One interesting finding of this study is the lateral heterogeneities of the VS model. Given the laterally homo-
             geneous nature of Vph (Figure 3a), the lateral variability in the 2‐D VS model primarily stems from the H/V ratio
             variation. This observation raises questions about whether the lateral variability in the VS model reflects true firn
             structure or artifacts induced by uncorrelated noise. To address this question, we conduct forward modeling of
             surface waves (Text S5 in Supporting Information S1). This demonstrates that the lateral variations in H/V ratio
             obtained from a laterally homogeneous VS model are negligible compared to those observed in field data,
             assuming a Gaussian‐type normal distribution for uncorrelated noise. Lateral VS variations are therefore unlikely
             to be entirely due to artifacts, indicating a degree of lateral variability in the shallow firn layer. These variations
             could be induced by various erosion and deposition patterns from localized surface processes, such as wind‐
             driven snow drifting. Notably, variable firn depth and density have been documented within a range of few
             meters (Weinhart et al., 2020; Wever et al., 2022).

             Although ice‐cores will always provide valuable ground‐truth data, the accuracy of our results potentially allows
             seismic observations to replace them in data‐poor areas. Our estimates of density, for example, can help calibrate
             mass balance estimations from satellite altimetry, where variations in surface height are used to infer alterations in
             ice mass or firn density changes (e.g., Holland et al., 2011). Furthermore, inferences from a reliable density profile
             could reliably include age estimates. The key consideration is with a deployment of passively‐recording seismic
             instrumentation, we have a means of long‐term ice‐sheet monitoring that combines high‐spatial and high‐
             temporal resolution of ice sheet processes, requiring only the field logistics to deploy and service sensors.
             In this study, higher mode surface waves are seen in ANCs at frequencies above 20 Hz (Figures 1c and 1d).
             Performing a multi‐modal surface wave inversion can further improve the velocity model of the ice structure
             beneath the TIME array. Measurements of high‐quality phase and amplitude information of higher mode surface
             waves require the fundamental mode signals being removed from the ANCs (Qiu et al., 2021). By subtracting
             fundamental mode surface waves given by the velocity model from this study, the joint inversion of multi‐modal
             surface wave phase velocity and H/V dispersion can image the ice structure beneath the TIME array with higher
             spatial resolution. This will be a subject of future study.


             5. Conclusion
             In this study, we obtain high‐resolution VS model for ice structures in the uppermost 100 m near the WAIS Divide
             camp using 1‐week ambient seismic data collected from a dense linear 1‐D nodal array. To boost the energy of the
             fundamental‐mode Rayleigh wave and enhance the precision of the resulting Vs model, we employ three‐station
             interferometry and phase‐matched filtering on ANCs to mitigate measurement errors in Vph and H/V ratios,
             respectively. The obtained high‐resolution VS model reveals prominent vertical variations and subtle lateral
             heterogeneities in firn structure, the latter shown to be at least partially indicative of firn structure through forward
             modeling. The VP model inferred from the ambient noise tomography, although with large uncertainties, is
             consistent with results derived from P‐wave travel‐time inversion of active‐source data. The density profile,
             empirically converted from the VS model, provides valuable insights into the firn densification process. It sug-
             gests a pore close‐off depth at ∼49 m, consistent with previous studies. Assuming steady state compaction, we
             derive the ice age up to 142 years in the top 49 m, compatible with measurements from ice core analysis. The
             method can be applied to other regions in Antarctica with dense array deployments and easily implemented to
             long‐term ice sheet monitoring. By enhancing our understanding of firn layer properties, the tomographic tool

                                             1. Introduction
                                             Glacial ice is interactive with Earth's climate change. As a complex multiscale medium, its composite struc-
                                             ture varies from millimeters to kilometers (Golden et al., 2020). How the small-scale ice structures influence
                                             coarse-grained climate models is an ongoing research question. To answer this question, we need to know the phys-
                                             ical processes acting on the ice sheet, such as ice dynamics and thermodynamics (Conway & Rasmussen, 2009;
                                             Lai et al., 2020; Sergienko, 2022). Seismic surveys record vibrations traveling through rock and ice with their

                     imaging using the reflected SH waves and interpret the reflector as a boundary of grain-size change. Finally, we
                     discuss the feasibility of estimating petrophysical properties from multiple component data.

                     Ambient noise cross-correlation is an effective seismic method to study Earth's structure (Shearer, 2019). Surface
                     waves are generally the strongest signals observed in noise cross-correlation, which makes high-resolution surface
                     wave tomography possible (Hu et al., 2020; Jaxybulatov et al., 2014; Shapiro et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007).
                     Surface waves are also preferred to investigate seismic anisotropy due to their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
                     and observable dispersion splitting caused by anisotropy (S. X. Zhang et al., 2009; Chaput et al., 2022). Indeed,
                     shear waves enable better constraints on seismic anisotropy in ice sheets compared to P waves (Diez et al., 2016).
                     Surface wave dispersion curve inversion has been widely used for imaging the shallow structures of the Antarc-
                     tic (Diez et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2021; Picotti et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2018). The derived 1D velocity models
                     are first-order approximations of a heterogeneous Earth. More advanced 2D/3D inversion algorithms such as
                     wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion (Z.-D. Zhang & Alkhalifah, 2019b) and full-waveform inversion
                     methods (Pan et al., 2021) are then proposed to handle the lateral variations in the near-surface. The main benefits
                     of the wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion method over traditional 1D inversion methods are that (a)
                     it can handle lateral variations; (b) it avoids picking dispersion curves; (c) it utilizes both the fundamental and
                     higher modes of Rayleigh and Love waves and (d) the inversion can be solved using gradient-based optimization
                     algorithms. Different from the classic waveform inversion method, the proposed inversion measures the differ-
                     ence of the frequency-dependent phase velocity (f-v spectrum). The f-v spectrum retains the important dispersion
                     features and at the same time reduces the inherent complexity of waveforms, which reduces the non-linearity of
                     inversion. We thus adopt the wave-equation dispersion spectrum inversion method to estimate the shear wave
                     velocities of shallow ice sheets.

                     Cross-correlation of noise in principle can extract the complete Green's function between two stations, including
                     any reflections, multiples, or scattered waves. Body waves detected from noise cross-correlation have also been
                     used to study the deep Earth (Boué et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013). Horizontally polarized (SH) waves have many
                     advantages over the traditional compressional (P) waves or vertically polarized (SV) waves in imaging layer
                     boundaries (Woolery et al., 1993; J. Li et al., 2019; Mecking et al., 2021). Specifically, SH waves have a shorter
                     wavelength than P waves at comparable frequencies, facilitating a higher spatial resolution. SH waves are also
                     decoupled from P and SV waves in an isotropic medium, incurring a cleaner image. Besides, SH reflections are
                     often better separated from surface waves than P or converted waves in a near-surface imaging setting. In practice,
                     SH waves extracted from ambient noise can penetrate to the deep earth's interior (H. Li et al., 2010; Shearer, 2019)
                     and are also useful for shallow structural imaging (Draganov et al., 2009; Gu et al., 2021; Nakata et al., 2011). In a
                     seismic reflection survey carried out on the Alpine glacier Colle Gnifetti, SH-wave bed reflections fit the ice-core
                     length better than P-wave bed reflections (Diez et al., 2014). But reliable controlled excitation of shear waves is
                     expensive on land and not yet developed in the marine environment (Bakulin & Calvert, 2005). Ambient noise
                     cross-correlation can effectively extract SH-reflections regardless of the environment. In our study, the extracted
                     SH reflections from ambient noise provide unique information about an englacial seismic discontinuity observed
                     at about 1,700 km depth near West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide Camp.

                     Seismic data recorded at Earth's surface preserve the time history of seismic waves traveling in the Earth's inte-
                     rior (Levin, 1984). We need cutting-edge processing methods to extract useful geological information from
                     massive seismic observations. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a seismic imaging method to map the subsurface
                     reflectivity using reflected waves. Reverse time migration (RTM) calculates reflector images where the down-
                     going waves meet the waves that travel up (Claerbout, 1971) and it involves three steps: (a) forward modeling
                     of seismic wavefields through given velocity models and sources as well as (b) backpropagating time-reversed
                     seismic reflections using the same velocity models, and (c) applying the imaging condition (e.g., a zero-lag
                     cross-correlation of forward- and backward-propagated wavefields). As a wavefield-based imaging method,
                     RTM takes complete physics (e.g., elasticity, anisotropy, and attenuation) into consideration and does not have
                     layer-model assumptions often required by ray-based imaging methods. Although the computational cost is also
                     higher than ray-based methods, rapid improvements in computational power and developments in dense array
                     acquisitions make wavefield-based imaging methods possible for solving large-scale imaging problems.

                     (Conway & Rasmussen, 2009). The spatial sampling is 30 m and the total length of the acquisition line is 2.25 km.



                     2. Study Site
                     The WAIS is a segment of the continental ice sheet covering the West Antarctic. As a marine-based ice sheet,
                     its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS has contributed to significant
                     loss of ice and rise in sea level since the beginning of the twenty-first century, due to the rapid thinning, retreat,
                     and acceleration of major outlet glaciers (Meredith et al., 2019). Geological and glaciological data have been
                     collected to study the asymmetric pattern of thickness change across the divide. The WAIS Divide Core data
                     allow us to learn about the crystal orientation fabric of ice (Fitzpatrick et al., 2014) and to recover the historical
                     Holocene accumulation rate (Koutnik et al., 2016). Seismic surveys, which are more cost-effective than deep ice
                     drilling, are also conducted to study the composite structure of ice near the WAIS Divide drilling site. Similarly,
                     polarimetric ice-penetrating radar measurements are also able to detect anisotropic fabric patterns using birefrin-
                     gence of ice crystals at radar frequencies (Young et al., 2021).

                     In this study, we use seismic data collected in January 2019 from a temporary deployment located about 5 km north-
                     east of the WAIS Divide Camp and extending about 2.5 km along-flow toward the Walgreen Coast. The deploy-
                     ment consists of 100 3-component, Z-Land Gen2, 5 Hz Magseis Fairfield seismic nodes (Ringler et al., 2018).
                     Nodes were buried at 30 cm depth, leveled with a bubble level, and oriented using an Antarctica-weighted Brun-
                     ton compass. The nodes recorded continuously with a sampling rate of 1,000 samples per second. Seventy-six
                     nodes were deployed along a 2.25-km-long line with 30-m spacing as shown in Figure 1. Twenty-four nodes
                     deployed in a 500-m diameter circle at the same time are the subject of other studies (Chaput et al., 2022).
                     These seismic node configurations were designed to record controlled seismic source tests during January 2019
                     (Karplus et al., 2019), but they are also very useful for passive seismic studies, as we show in this paper. The
                     seismic line used in this study follows the same location as a previous controlled-source seismic reflection line
                     collected in 2008–2009 (Horgan et al., 2011, Figure 1b) and is partially colocated with a radar line collected in
                     2020 (Young et al., 2021).

Figure 2. Example of virtual-shot gathers constructed using vertical-vertical (ZZ), vertical-radial (ZR) and tangential-tangential (TT) components. ZZ and ZR data are
Rayleigh wave dominated and TT data are Love wave dominated. A notable trace anomaly (no. 38) marked by the green arrow is observed from ZZ data. The TT data
look noisier than ZZ and ZR data but have clear reflections marked by the yellow arrow.


                                          3. Data Processing
                                          We have a 1-week continuous recording of ambient noise on the line of Magseis Fairfield 3-component nodes. We
                                          calculate the node-to-node correlations of vertical-vertical (ZZ), vertical-radial (ZR) and transverse-transverse
                                          (TT) data components. Specifically, the sequential processing steps are (a) instrument response removal,

                                          time-domain waveform-similarity weighted stacking (Z.-D. Zhang et al., 2020). Figure 2 shows example virtual
                                          shot gathers of ZZ, ZR and TT components, respectively. Rayleigh waves are mainly reconstructed from the ZZ-
                                          and ZR-component data, while Love waves are primarily recorded in the TT-component data according to their
                                          particle motion difference. There are also body waves that are weak in amplitudes compared with surface waves.
                                          The TT-component data seem to have relatively stronger body waves and noise than the ZZ- and ZR-component
                                          data. We also observe a trace with an anomalously late arrival time for the ZZ-component data (marked by a
                                          green arrow in Figure 2). We continue with calculating the horizontal and the vertical particle velocity ratio
                                          (H/V ratio) of traces that are close to that trace. As shown in Figure 3, the trace with traveltime anomaly (black
                                          line) shows a different H/V ratio with its neighboring traces for different (virtual) sources. In contrast, its neigh-
                                          boring traces on both sides share similar H/V ratios. The H/V ratio difference may attribute to the site effects
                                          according to Sylvette et al. (2006). We will investigate the cause of such a difference in the 2D inversion section.
                                          We then calculate the frequency-slowness spectra of the ZZ- and TT-component data in the following way: (a)

                                          and large (900 m) offsets away from the virtual source for visualization. The selected traces are fixed while the virtual sources
                                          are varying. They suggest that the 38th trace shows a different H/V ratio from its neighboring traces.

                     Figure 4. Example frequency-slowness spectra of the ZZ and TT data shown in Figure 2. Rayleigh and Love waves are
                     clearly shown in ZZ and TT data (white arrows), respectively. The yellow arrows point to weak body S-waves with a velocity
                     of around 2 km/s. A cloud of energy with high velocity (about 3.3 km/s) marked by a magenta arrow is identified in TT data.
                     It is well separated from the Love wave in slowness.


                     We decompose the time-domain data to mono-frequency components. (b) We use the slant stacking to convert
                     the data in the frequency-offset domain to their dispersion spectra in the frequency-slowness domain. We calcu-
                     late the spectra using traces at least 300 m away from the virtual shot trace. As expected, we observe strong
                     fundamental modes of Rayleigh and Love waves from the frequency-slowness spectra of ZZ and TT data, respec-
                     tively. There are also weak SV and SH body waves pointed to by the yellow arrows. We also observe relatively
                     strong waves with a phase velocity of about 3.3 km/s, which could be the leaking mode of P waves and are not
                     used for inversion.


                     4. 1D Dispersion Curve Inversion
                     We pick the Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion curves from frequency-slowness spectra of ZZ- and TT-component
                     data as shown in Figure 4, respectively. The picker seeks the slowness corresponding to the peak amplitude at
                     each frequency. We use the inversion algorithm developed by Haney and Tsai (2017), which assumes a layered
                     Earth, to estimate the 1D velocity profiles. The inversion is based on weighted-damped least squares and thus
                     effectively generates smoothly varying velocity estimation in depth. We start with linearly increasing velocity
                     and density models and keep P-wave velocity and density fixed during the inversion. Figure 5a shows the initial
                     and inverted 1D vertical shear-wave velocities. A low-velocity (<1,400 m/s) layer at shallow depths (<30 m) is
                     reconstructed after inversion. The inverted velocities increase with depth and become almost constant at depths
                     greater than 100 m. The inverted velocity model overall agrees with the published velocity models in the Western
                     Antarctic (Diez et al., 2016; Picotti et al., 2015). The data comparison shown in Figures 5c and 5d indicate that
                     the inversion algorithm does a decent job of matching the observed dispersion curve. Data residuals at both ends
                     of frequencies (lower than 1.5 Hz or higher than 25 Hz) are minor. The limited span of nodes (about 2.5 km)
                     and relatively sparse node sampling (about 30 m) cast the lower and upper limits for resolvable surface waves. It
                     requires that the lowest frequency should be above 1 Hz to record one cycle of the surface waves. Meanwhile, the
                     frequency should be lower than 20 Hz to avoid data aliasing (i.e., at least two nodes per wavelength, assuming the
                     shallow velocity is 1,200 m/s). The sensitivity kernel of the Rayleigh wave (Figure 5b) provides a way to evaluate
                     the accuracy of the inverted velocity model. Higher data sensitivity usually means a more reliable reconstruction
                     of the velocity model at that depth. The inversion progressively boosts the weak data sensitivities, and thus, we
                     can have model updates in depths below 100 m in this example. However, the estimated velocity in such depth is
                     more vulnerable to noise and other factors that may contaminate the velocity model.

                     We use the inverted vertical shear-wave velocity as the starting model for the Love wave dispersion curve inver-
                     sion. As shown in Figure 6, the velocity discrepancy indicates radial anisotropy on this site. Shear waves prop-
                     agate faster in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction in the upmost few meters (<10 m). The
                     fast-propagation direction becomes horizontal below around 10 m depth, which is reasonable for gravity sedi-
                     mentary and crystalline fabric of ice. This observation also agrees with the findings from Picotti et al. (2015).

                     velocity mismatch before and after inversion. A significant mismatch between observed and inverted phase-velocity
                     dispersion curves at low frequencies may be reasonable due to the limited survey line.


                     However, the estimated Vsh in depths below 100 m is presumably larger than the actual values, as indicated by the
                     data mismatch at low frequencies shown in Figures 6c and 6d. The predicted dispersion curve is slightly higher
                     than the observed one below 5 Hz, which indicates that the velocity is likely overestimated below 100 m (the
                     penetration depth is about one-third of the wavelength). This data residual, of course, can be further reduced by
                     lifting the model regularization. However, we need the model regularization to avoid data overfitting, especially
                     for real data applications. The Love wave data sensitivity (Figure 6b) reduces rapidly as depth increase, which
                     indicates that the estimated Vsh has a large uncertainty beyond 200 m depth. Besides, the TT-component data are
                     also noisy, preventing a more exact data fitting.

                     1D dispersion curve inversion, as a widely used inversion method, provides some insights into the velocity
                     structure averaged along the line. However, it also sacrifices the lateral resolution to the subsurface. Though a
                     fine-tuned pseudo-2D inversion (e.g., multiple 1D profiles along a line) can add some lateral variations (Zigone
                     et al., 2015), the layer-model assumption is still a strong approximation for heterogeneous earth. In the next
                     section, we will apply the 2D wave-equation-based dispersion spectrum inversion method to the data set, which
                     considers the more complete physics of wave propagation.


                     5. 2D Wave-Equation Dispersion Spectrum Inversion
                     The wave-equation dispersion curve inversion method was introduced by Z.-D. Zhang et al. (2015). The idea
                     is to replace the multilayer dispersion computation (Haskell, 1953) with more advanced wave-equation solu-
                     tions, where a heterogeneous model can be used. Later, Z.-D. Zhang and Alkhalifah (2019b) replaced the picked
                     dispersion curves with the whole dispersion spectrum as the input data and derived the formula for gradient
                     calculation. The inversion method becomes practically useful for processing large-volume data sets and has been
                     used for solving problems across scales (Z.-D. Zhang et al., 2021). The workflow is similar to the widely used

                     form the time-domain waveform data to the frequency domain (f-x data, x denotes offsets) and then calculate their
                     dispersion spectra (f-v) using the linear Radon transform (Luo et al., 2008). By maximizing the local similarities
                     between the predicted and f-v spectra, we obtain the optimal shear-wave velocity estimation for the subsurface
                     (Z.-D. Zhang & Alkhalifah, 2019b).

                     We solve the seismic wave propagation problem using the spectral element method (Komatitsch & Tromp, 1999).
                     We first estimate the vertical shear-wave velocity using Rayleigh waves convoluted with Ricker wavelets with
                     peak frequencies of 8 and 12 Hz, sequentially. We choose these frequencies for the following reasons: (a) the
                     calculated empirical Green's functions have a peak frequency of around 8 Hz and (b) the length and receiver
                     sampling of the array suggest low and high limits for the useful frequencies. The array should record 2–3 cycles
                     of surface waves for a reliable calculation of the f-v spectra and meanwhile, one cycle of surface waves should
                     be recorded by at least two receivers to avoid aliasing (Foti et al., 2018). The source wavelet used for forward
                     modeling is the time integral of the Ricker wavelet with the same peak frequency. Notably this will implicitly
                     apply a time derivative to the calculated empirical Green's functions. A point-source to line-source correction is
                     also applied to transform seismic data recorded in a 3D real world to a 2D computation domain (Pica et al., 1990).
                     The shear-wave velocity is updated iteratively using the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
                     (l-BFGS) algorithm (Liu & Nocedal, 1989). The inversion converges in 2 hr with eight computation nodes and
                     each node is equipped with 40 threads. Figure 7 shows the inverted shear-wave velocities using 76 virtual shot
                     gathers. The history of velocity model updates is also provided in the Supporting Information Figure S1. The
                     inverted Vsv model also indicates a low-velocity layer (<30 m) on top of an almost constant velocity layer (about
                     2 km/s). The lateral variation is mild as we can expect for the ice sheet. Following the inversion strategy we used

                     Figure 7. Inverted vertical and horizontal shear wave velocities and their ratios using the 2D inversion method. Both inverted
                     Vsv and Vsh velocities show a low-velocity layer in the upper 30 m and mild lateral variations. The ratio of horizontal and
                     vertical velocities shows an evident lateral change near the 38th station, where we observe a trace anomaly in Figure 2. Three
                     vertical profiles located at the dashed lines are also extracted for further analysis.


                     in the 1D inversion, we use the inverted Vsv model as the input for the Love wave inversion. The inverted Vsh
                     model is quite close to the starting model and has no significant updates below 200 m (e.g., Vsh/Vsv − 1 ≈ 0
                     in Figure 7). We also measure the radial anisotropy using the Vsh and Vsv ratio. An interesting observation is
                     that the measured radial anisotropy shows evident lateral variations in the shallow layer. The transition point is
                     coincidentally close to the anomaly trace we observed from the ZZ data (Figure 2). The inverted Vsh is in general
                     greater than Vsv and the maximum velocity difference is about 8%. There is no significant difference in Vsh
                     and Vsv at depths below 200 m due to the vanished Love-wave data sensitivity. For a better comparison, we also
                     extract three vertical profiles at different lateral locations marked by dashed lines in the 2D inversion results. As
                     shown in Figure 8, the estimated velocities using the 2D inversion are not far from those obtained from a 1D
                     inversion due to the mild lateral variation in this region (see the Supporting Information Figure S1 for a direct
                     comparison). The derived radial anisotropy in the firn layer can be strongly heterogeneous due to the variable and
                     often loose compaction of the snow. The ice layer presents a consistent radial anisotropy due to the layering of ice.
                     The horizontal shear wave velocity is always larger than the vertical one. The directional velocity difference has
                     a maximum of 8% and also varies laterally. There is not much difference between horizontal and vertical S-wave
                     velocities beyond 200 m because of the reduced data sensitivity at those depths.

                     Following the work of Diez et al. (2014), we further estimate the top of the ice and the thickness of firn-air
                     content from the inverted S-wave velocities. The first step is to convert the estimated S-wave velocity to density
                     using their empirical relationship (Diez et al., 2014),

                     Figure 8. Extracted vertical profiles from Figure 7. The inverted velocities from the 2D inversion are not far from those
                     inverted from the 1D inversion. The lateral variation of shear wave velocity is mild in this region. However, the horizontal
                     and vertical velocity ratio shows a more significant change with locations. A transition from a positive radial anisotropy ratio
                     (Vsh > Vsv) to a negative value (Vsh < Vsv) for the upper 30 m happens near the 38th trace location. The layer composed
                     of firn (30–150 m) always has a more higher shear wave velocity in the horizontal direction. The deep layer shows no clear
                     velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions, which is significantly different from the 1D inversion.

                     ice density. We use a 1D S-wave velocity, which is an average of vertical and horizontal S-wave velocities as
                     shown in Figures 7a and 7b, as Vs(z). The S-wave velocity for ice (Vs,ice = 1,930 m/s) is picked from depths around
                     100 m, where the inverted velocity is almost constant.

                     The firn basement is at the pore close-off depth, that is, a density of 830 kg/m 3. The depth of firn basement is at

                     We use the ice depth of 62 m and obtain the firn-air content thickness, which is about 17 m. Our finding is in
                     good agreement with Munneke et al. (2014) and Diez et al. (2016), who modeled firn-air content thickness to be
                     about 20 and 18 m, respectively, on the Ross Ice Shelf. The firn-air content thickness is a key factor in assessing
                     ice-shelf stability. Although our study area is on an ice-sheet, the proposed method can be easily applied to seis-
                     mic data collected on ice shelves.


                     7. Inversion Uncertainty Analysis
                     It is important to know which features of the inverted 2D models are well resolved and thus are reliable. In this
                     study, we are particularly interested in knowing the maximum resolvable depth of the inverted S-wave veloci-
                     ties. Checkerboard tests and point-spread function tests are two traditional uncertainty quantification methods
                     that can do this task. However, they also suffer from huge computational demand and limited spatial resolution.
                     Alternatively, we use a finite-difference approximation to calculate the depth sensitivity of Rayleigh and Love
                     waves' dispersion spectra, also known as the Frechét derivatives. Specifically, we first divide the inverted S-wave
                     velocities (Figures 7a and 7b) into 10 layers and assign 10% perturbations to each layer. Then we calculate the
                     synthetic waveform data using the background and perturbed models. Finally, we quantify the dispersion spec-
                     trum perturbations caused by S-wave velocity perturbations at variable depths for frequencies of interest. Figure 9
                     shows the calculated depth sensitivities of Rayleigh and Love waves used in this study. In general, high-frequency
                     data are sensitive to a shallow depth and vice versa. Love waves are more sensitive to a shallower depth than
                     Rayleigh waves at the same frequencies. These observations agree with the results from traditional 1D inversions
                     (Figures 5c and 6c). From the available frequencies (i.e., about 5–15 Hz from Figure 4), we confirm that the
                     inverted velocities (e.g., Figure 7) are robustly constructed in the top 200 m. The vanished radial anisotropy below
                     200 m depth is more likely caused by the reduced depth sensitivity of Love waves.

                     We then show the history of data convergence for each inversion stage in Figure 10. The inversion stops when
                     there are no significant updates. No gold standard exists for an acceptable misfit reduction in real data applica-
                     tions. But the data misfit reduction in our case is sufficient compared to a real-data example (e.g., Figure 14 in
                     Vigh et al. (2014)). We further compare the dispersion spectra and waveforms before and after inversion to better
                     understand the data agreement. Notably, the waveform data are not directly used by the inversion algorithm and
                     thus can indicate whether the inversion has a balanced data fitting. Figure 11 shows the Rayleigh wave dispersion
                     spectra of the observed, initially predicted and finally predicted ZZ- and ZR-component data, respectively. The
                     predicted dispersion spectra from the inverted shear-wave velocity match the observed ones reasonably well.
                     The objective function used for inversion focuses on matching the curvature of the dispersion spectrum. This
                     is reasonable for real data applications because the amplitude can be influenced by many factors that are not

                     considered in the numerical simulation, such as attenuation and noise. We continue with showing the waveform
                     comparison in Figures 12 and 13. Note that we do not use the waveform difference in our objective function.
                     The accuracy of waveforms calculated from the correlated wavefields is still in debate (Nakata et al., 2013).
                     Instead, we measure the slope of arrivals, which is an indicator of the accuracy of the estimated velocity model.
                     Figures 12a and 13a are the observed ZZ- and ZR-component data, respectively. The initially predicted ZZ and
                     ZR waveforms from the linearly increasing velocity model are shown in Figures 12 and 13b, respectively. We
                     calculate the non-zero lag cross-correlation of the observed and initially predicted ZZ and ZR data shown in
                     Figures 12c and 13c. A black dashed line is added to aid the evaluation of the flatness of correlated traces. The
                     flatness of the cross-correlation functions along traces indicates the accuracy of the inverted velocity model.
                     The side-lobe of the cross-correlation function indicates the accuracy of the dispersion feature of the recon-
                     structed Rayleigh waves from the inverted shear velocity. We ignore the constant time lag since it is related to the
                     origin time of the source wavelet, which will not affect our inversion. The improvement in waveform similarity
                     after inversion is clearly shown in Figures 12d and 13d. A notable difference is that the numerically predicted
                     waveform amplitudes are stronger for high-frequency data, while the observed data seem to have a stronger
                     amplitude for the low-frequency data. Presumably the attenuation that happens in the real Earth can explain such
                     difference, where an opportunity for attenuation factor (Q) estimation exists. The cross-correlation functions
                     shown in Figures 12e and 13e further confirm the improvements in waveform similarity after inversion. The
                     cross-correlation function becomes flat and spiky along traces.

                     We also show the dispersion spectra of Love waves in Figure 14. The observed Love wave dispersion spectrum
                     is dominated by low-frequency energies as shown in Figure 14a. The inverted dispersion spectrum (Figure 14b)
                     matches the observed one reasonably well at low frequencies (<15 Hz). The finally predicted dispersion spec-
                     trum fails to match the observed one at higher frequencies, partially because the dispersion energy is too weak
                     to be utilized. By visually checking the dispersion spectra at high frequencies, we can find that the predicted
                     spectrum has a higher phase velocity than the observed one. Using the general mapping relationship between the

                     Figure 11. Frequency-velocity spectra of the observed, initial and inverted Rayleigh waves. We plot the ZZ and ZR data
                     for the first virtual source data. The inverted f-v spectra have a better agreement with the observed ones than the initially
                     predicted data.


                     available frequency and the penetration depth, we anticipate that our estimated Vsh model has a higher velocity
                     than the actual case in the very shallow layer. The waveform data shown in Figure 15a are apparently noisier
                     than ZZ and ZR data. Body waves, including primary arrivals and reflections from a deep layer, are also visually
                     seen. The finally predicted waveform data (Figure 15b) are close to the observed one in terms of the slopes.
                     The cross-correlation function is also flattened along traces (Figure 15c). But we do see some side-lobes of the
                     cross-correlation function, those nearly-flat ones are due to the imperfect prediction for the velocity model and
                     the dipping ones are just crosstalks between the observed body waves and the simulated Love waves. We antic-
                     ipate that the reflection SH waves marked by the yellow arrow could be from a deep discontinuity, where RTM
                     imaging can help with finding their origins.


                     8. Reverse Time Migration Imaging Using Reflection SH Waves
                     Normally, body wave energy is weak and hard to extract from ambient noise, and hence we need extra steps
                     for body-wave extraction (Nakata et al., 2011, 2015). In this data set, because we have transverse components
                     and surface waves are not overlapped to body waves, the reflected SH waves are coherently extracted from the
                     recorded ambient noise by examining several virtual shot gathers. Figures 16a–16c show three example shot gath-
                     ers with different virtual source locations. We apply a time-selection window to highlight the reflection waves.
                     By stacking the nearby two traces on both sides of the virtual source, we can obtain the so-called zero-offset
                     profile shown in Figure 16d. The two-way traveltime (TWT) of the image is the traveltime of the SH wave from
                     the virtual source to the reflector and then back to the receiver co-located with the virtual source. TWT can be
                     converted to depth by using prior interval velocities. The time-domain image (Figure 16d) shows a dipping reflec-
                     tor that causes the reflections observed in the TT-component data, which is also confirmed by the moveout differ-
                     ence observed in Figure 16b. The (apparent) slope of SH reflection waves on both sides of the virtual source is
                     asymmetric. Since the lateral variation of velocity is mild in the study area, such slope difference is likely caused
                     by the dipping of the reflector. The moveout of traces located at larger X (marked by a yellow arrow) indicates a
                     faster apparent velocity caused by the dipping layer's uplifting side. The time-domain zero-offset image provides

                     a first glance of the reflector. The imaging method is robust since it is directly from the observation data. But it
                     cannot provide accurate depth or dipping angle of reflectors.
                     Here we calculate the RTM image using the time-windowed SH reflections (Nakata et al., 2015). We extend the
                     Vsh model (Figure 7) by flooding with a constant velocity of 1,994 m/s below 150 m and propagating seismic
                     waves using the spectral element method. We scale the velocity value by 0.5 to get the density model, which is
                     an approximation to a derived relationship between velocity and density (Diez et al., 2014). We anticipate that
                     the density error will have a minimal imprint on the velocity estimation due to weak data sensitivity. Figure 17
                     shows the raw RTM image and its envelope for better visualization. Due to the poor illumination at boundaries
                     and the lack of near-offset reflections (see Figure 16 for evidence), we have a limited range of imaging with
                     high quality. The reflector image is spread in-depth due to the relatively low-frequency range (5–15 Hz) used for
                     imaging. We show the trace-normalized envelope of the raw RTM image in Figure 17b. A solid green line marks
                     a dipping reflector at about 1,700 m depth. The poor data quality interprets a lateral discontinuity marked by the
                     yellow dashed line as imaging artifacts. The lateral depth variation of the imaged reflector is also questionable
                     due to poor data quality. However, the RTM image agrees well with the time-domain image unraveling a dipping
                     reflector.

                     Reflecting SH wave imaging using ambient-noise data may provide unique illumination to the subsurface.
                     Reflection SH waves are well separated from the surface waves, as shown in this example. PSV or PP reflections
                     largely overlap with surface waves, which prevents their practical use for reflection imaging. Furthermore, SH
                     reflections are purely seismic responses to abrupt changes in shear impedance. By examining the different reac-
                     tions of P- and S-wave to the structures in the subsurface, we can predict the physical process of the subsurface.
                     In this study, we did not find clear PP or PSV reflections related to the imaged reflector by searching for possible

                     the reflectors. A combination of P- and S-wave responses can infer the petrophysical change in the subsurface
                     (Loh et al., 2017; Vanorio et al., 2005). Three different combinations of P- and S-wave responses correspond
                     to three different boundary conditions. To be specific, (a) a variation in rock matrix but not in pore fluid can
                     generate strong P- and S-wave reflections, (b) No variations in rock matrix but in pore fluid can generate strong
                     P-wave but weak S-wave reflections, (c) A mineralogy, cementation and porosity condition change can generate
                     weak P-wave but strong S-wave reflections. In this study, we only observed reflected SH waves from a particular
                     discontinuity, which the porosity change of ice can explain. It is also possible that surface waves hide P-wave
                     reflections due to their overlaps in traveltime, but the chance is not high for reflections at near-offsets. Aside
                     from a cross-comparison with P-waves, the amplitude variation with offset of SH waves may provide additional

                                             In this study, we show how seismic imaging can help us estimate the petrophysical parameters of ice and further
                                             uncover ice dynamics. The wave equation dispersion spectrum inversion method can provide reliable estimations
                                             for heterogeneous shear-wave velocities. Compared with conventional 1D inversion results, our new results also
                                             provide additional information about the lateral variation of shear-wave velocities. We further estimate thick-
                                             nesses of firn-air content and firn from the inverted 2D model. The radial anisotropy of firn and shallow ice
                                             derived from the inverted velocities shows a higher resolution than the velocities themselves. A lateral variation
                                             is clearly shown and the transition point co-located with the anomaly trace observed from the ZZ data. The
                                             inversion uncertainty analysis indicates that the top 200 m of the inverted models are well-resolved. The vanished
                                             radial anisotropy below 200 m is likely caused by reduced data sensitivity of Love waves. We also observe SH
                                             reflections from the TT data and calculate seismic images of the reflectors using a robust and straightforward
                                             time-domain imaging method and a more advanced RTM method. We link the seismic discontinuity to porosity
                                             changes at that depth by comparing the P- and S-wave responses.

The inverted resistivity profiles of the TEM data show highly
resistive rock layers (1000 to 100 000  m) directly under the
ice in the trough and on the plateau with a ∼ 1000  m layer
at depths > 2 km. Furthermore, all inverted resistivity sound-
ings for line A and B (Appendix B, Fig. B2) show very sim-
ilar results consisting of a highly resistive subsurface. The
TEM method can resolve conductive structures more accu-
rately than resistive ones, highlighted by a tighter probability
density function over the lower ∼ 1000  m layer compared
to the resistive upper layer shown in Figs. 6 and B2.
   Multiple synthetic models were created using the forward-
modelling code in MuLTI-TEM. A three-layer model was
used with (1) a 100 000  m layer overlaying (2) a layer with
variable thickness and resistivity with (3) a 10 000  m base-
ment. The different resistivities tested for layer 2 were 0.1
(representing a hypersaline lake), 1, 10, and 10,000  m. The
different thicknesses tested for layer 2 were 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10,
and 100 m. Figure 7 shows the results from this test, high-
lighting that a 0.01 m thick layer of 0.1  m is resolvable
compared to the resistive subsurface observed beneath DIC.
Also, a 0.1 m thick, 1  m layer, and a 1 m thick, 10  m
layer is resolvable compared to the resistive subsurface ob-
served beneath DIC. These results provide further evidence
for the lack of subglacial water directly beneath DIC.

3.2.2   Magnetotellurics

At the high frequencies (100–30 Hz), the XY and YX
apparent-resistivity curves are similar, suggesting a 1D re-
sistivity structure. Below a frequency of 30 Hz, the XY and
YX apparent-resistivity curves separate, indicating a change
in resistivity structure to 2D or 3D (Fig. 5a). Here, the phase
tensors are aligned with the major axes perpendicular to the
trend of the subglacial trough and line B. While the skew an-
gles are not zero, the data in the frequency band 100–1 Hz
show evidence for a 2D behaviour with a strike of N105° E
(Fig. 8b–c). The data were rotated to a coordinate system          Figure 8. Phase tensor at frequencies of 58, 1.6, and 0.04 Hz plotted

Appendix A: Active-source seismic-reflection synthetic
modelling

For our synthetic seismograms, the near-surface Vp structure
of the snow, firn, and ice was derived from refraction ob-
servations in the seismic data, where the travel times of the
first arrivals were picked and a tomography inversion was
applied. This was used as the shallow Vp profile (0–80 m)
of the synthetic models. The seismic velocity profiles for the
two models are shown in Fig. A1a and b.

much as possible and preventing the resistivity model from over fitting the data. The τ = 3.2 inversion reached an rms misfit of 1.356 after

            subtracting the seasonal median PSD-PDF dB values. Black traces (1, 2, 3) show seasonal changes between for each component, with positive values indicating
            higher power during the summer. Solid yellow (4) and teal (7) traces show power differences in north versus east components for summer and winter, respectively,

            gathers showing times are shown in Figures 3–4. Colors indicate different shot types: Poulter (black), detonating cord (50 grains/ ft; red), detonating cord (400
            grains/ ft; blue), drilled shot (green). The Poulter shots are stronger for low frequencies and comparable at high frequencies relative to the thicker detonating
            cord. The thinner detonating cord is less strong at all frequencies, and the shallowly-drilled, 300 g shot is the weakest at all frequencies. Bold lines are the average
            frequency amplitude for each shot type.

                             ABSTRACT. Direct measurements of the properties of subglacial water are
                             necessary for understanding water flow beneath glaciers. In this paper we describe
                             the construction, calibration and field usage of two instruments-one that measures
                             turbidity and the other that measures electrical conductivity of sub glacial water. The
                             sensors are inexpensive and reliable. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of these
                             devices, we present samples of data obtained from beneath Trapridge Glacier, Yukon
                             Territory, Canada.


    INTRODUCTION                                                                           directly at the glacier bed, we have developed durable,
                                                                                           inexpensive sensors that allow continuous measurement of
    How does water flow beneath a glacier? This question has                               the turbidity and electrical conductivity of subglacial
    been a focus of glaciological research for more than three                             water. Measurements obtained with these sensors provide
    decades. As a result of these efforts, various drainage-                               direct indications of basal-water flow velocity and
    system configurations have been proposed. In many cases,                               subglacial provenance. In the following sections, we

    configurations. In other cases, existing theories of basal-                            these sensors. Data collected at the bed of Trapridge

    water flow beneath glaciers by describing instruments
    that measure, in situ, the turbidity and electrical
    conductivity of subglacial water. Direct measurement of                                TURBIDITY
    these properties at the glacier bed can lead to a more
    complete understanding of subglacial water flow.                                       Description of the device
        Until recently, drainage-system morphologies have
    been inferred largely from proglacial observations. These                              The basic components of the turbidity sensor are a light
    observations tend to include measurement in outlet                                     source, two photodetectors and a voltage regulator (Fig.
    streams of one or more of the following quantities: tracer                             la). For the light source, we use a miniature incandescent
    concentration, turbidity or electrical conductivity. The                               lamp manufactured by Spectro (part No. 8097). This
    most common method for studying subglacial water flow                                  source provides nearly spherical illumination, thereby
    involves determining the velocity of a tracer that has                                 reducing geometric constraints on construction. Because
    moved through the drainage system (e.g. Stenborg, 1969;                                the intensity of an incandescent source will change if the

Subglacial measurement of turbidity and electrical
conductivity

ABSTRACT. Direct measurements of the properties of subglacial water are
necessary for understanding water flow beneath glaciers. In this paper we describe
the construction, calibration and ficld usage of two instruments— one that measures
turbidity and the other that measures electrical conductivity of subglacial water. The
sensors are inexpensive and reliable. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of these
devices, we present samples of data obtained from beneath Trapridge Glacier, Yukon
Territory, Canada.

           7740 km, a hypocenter depth of 8 km, and a back-azimuth of 345°. For periods <7.0 s, PSDs were calculated using 50 s segments in 0.5 s moving increments. For
           periods >7.0 s, PSDs were calculated for 200 s intervals in 2.0 s moving increments. Red vertical lines mark ak135-predicted arrival times. Black rectangles mark the
           spectral and temporal integration bounds used for signal analysis. White and black line marks the acoustic cutoff period as estimated using Eqn (4). Red arrows
